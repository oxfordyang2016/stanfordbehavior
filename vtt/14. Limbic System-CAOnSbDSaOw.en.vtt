00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:05.962
Stanford University.

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:12.180
OK, and-- is this audible?

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:13.040
No.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:13.900
It's really quiet.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:14.910
Really quiet.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.196
Something's wrong with
the sound system today.

00:00:18.196 --> 00:00:19.560
How's that?

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.810
No.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:22.953
How's that?

00:00:22.953 --> 00:00:23.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:24.810
Placebo?

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.550
Maybe that would have worked?

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.640
OK, well, I guess I will
just have to shout out.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:30.140
But--

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.990
OK, help?

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.910
[INAUDIBLE]

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.292
[INAUDIBLE] falling off.

00:00:49.292 --> 00:00:50.000
Was I doing it--?

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.670
That's fine, yeah.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:51.170
OK.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:55.220
Good.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.761
So let's see.

00:00:55.761 --> 00:00:59.050
That is an event you
probably should check out.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.970
I'm still irritated you didn't
want a signed football for me,

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:03.650
but nonetheless--

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:09.240
OK, so, starting off, as the
large numbers of empty seats

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.460
imply, not only is
Monday the midterm

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.090
but today's not a topic that
we covered on the midterm.

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.660
So, in case you want to flee
right now, here's your chance.

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:18.750
I won't be upset.

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.280
But what we do here is
a look at our last topic

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.610
of our buckets-- in this
case, our neurobiology one.

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.680
And the whole
premise for this one

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.250
is to cover the most
wonderful, interesting parts

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.000
of the brain, which you're
going to hear squat about when

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.730
you wind up in medical school.

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.320
Again, from the other day,
what they will teach you

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.730
about endlessly
is stuff that goes

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.190
wrong with your
spinal cord or stuff

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.620
that goes wrong with
parts of your brain

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.810
that regulate your bladder and
your balance and motoric stuff.

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.270
How come-- because--

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.780
Yes?

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:53.738
You can't hear a thing.

00:01:53.738 --> 00:01:54.570
No.

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.090
No.

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.590
Um-- [NOISE OF HELPLESSNESS]

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.090
He's going to try to
find the sound guy.

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.200
OK, somebody's off to get sound.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.389
But in the meantime, I will
pantomime bladder problems.

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:11.460
So what you've got-- I will
try-- maybe in the back,

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.040
just start waving each time
I start hypoventilating

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.380
and run out of volume.

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.110
But what you've got here is not
the part of the nervous system

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.130
that's easy to find
out about, because it's

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.740
right on the surface.

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.640
Not the part that
people focus on,

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.570
because there's a lot
of spinal-cord injuries

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:31.530
and you can tell exactly
what's wrong by which

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.410
toe is no longer moving.

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.800
This is, instead,
focusing on the part

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.850
of the brain most
centrally involved

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.900
in emotion-- the limbic system.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.490
Now-- obvious why that
should be of interest to us,

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.620
more so than spinal pathways
controlling movement.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.720
And, in terms of making
sense of the limbic system,

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.930
this is going to be the most
horribly, multisyllabic,

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.820
diagram-laden class
of the entire class.

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.220
But, in terms of making
sense of it, what we will see

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.650
is there's some very,
very logical things going

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.030
on-- very logical strategies.

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.620
OK.

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.020
Originally, the
limbic system was not

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.400
known as the "limbic
system" but instead

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.860
had a name reflecting the
fact that people started off

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.600
studying it in rats.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.190
And you take a rat
brain, which looks

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.980
kind of like this from
the side, and you've

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.850
got your spinal cord and
cerebellum and cortex.

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.600
And what is this thing,
at the way front, there?

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.880
This is the olfactory bulb.

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.000
This is the olfactory
system of a rodent brain.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.430
And this is drawn exactly to
scale, down to the millimeter.

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.260
This is huge.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:41.480
This thing is huge.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.000
The olfactory bulb
and its projections

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.460
are 40% of the
brain of a rodent.

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:51.590
And when people began to
understand where the neurons

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.370
in the olfactory bulb were
sending their projections,

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.020
it was an area of the brain,
the underside of the brain,

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.990
which people very quickly
began to call this region

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:04.920
the "rhinencephalon"--
the "nose-brain."

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.240
Because, obviously, this
is what was processing

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.810
all this whomping great amount
of olfactory information coming

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:12.370
in.

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.520
And this area that
we now know and love

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.500
as the "limbic
system" at the time

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.350
was called the "rhinencephalon."

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.540
This dominated, early on,
with the neuroanatomists,

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.190
which is to say the people
who just sat there and said,

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.980
gee whiz, that's an awfully
large part of the brain, there.

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:29.780
And where does it
send its projections?

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.940
As people instead,
in the '30s and '40s,

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.810
began to understand the function
of this part of the brain, what

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.920
emerged was a very
different viewpoint,

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.400
from a different
school, which is,

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.480
it's doing all sorts
of stuff with emotion.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.470
And this picture of
this region of the brain

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:47.530
as having that role.

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:49.960
For reasons I don't
completely understand,

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.040
somehow the people who liked
the, it's all about emotion,

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.100
started calling it
the "limbic system."

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.380
And thus you had one of
the most central conflicts

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.420
of the 20th century, which
was whether this thing should

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:04.320
be called the "rhinencephalon"
or the "limbic system."

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.970
And thousands of innocent
people were slaughtered

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:08.540
before it was all over with.

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:11.730
Brother pitted against
brother savagery.

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:14.570
And what we've got-- much
of Picasso's paintings

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:16.540
were about some of the
atrocities committed

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:18.500
by the rhinencephalon people.

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.450
But what wound up
ultimately happening

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:23.480
was a completely
logical resolution.

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:27.030
"Rhinencephalon," "limbic
system"-- is it about odor?

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:28.330
Is it about emotion?

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.290
And all you have to do is
think like an ethologist,

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:32.770
and you've got your answer.

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:34.940
Which is, if you're
a rat, there's

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:40.620
not an emotion on earth that's
not intertwined with olfaction.

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.130
The rat's emotional
world is utterly

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:45.920
driven by olfactory information.

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:49.850
And thus, for a rat, the
rhinencephalon, the nose-brain,

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:52.580
is the part of the brain
getting all the information

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:55.300
coming in that has
any relevance to

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:59.020
the good, interesting, emotional
stuff going on in a rat's life.

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.510
So there's massive resolution.

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:02.690
Peace in their time.

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:05.750
Suddenly, this recognition
that, of course,

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:10.085
a rhinencephalon is going
to be sending projections--

00:06:10.085 --> 00:06:12.460
is going to be all a part of
the part of the brain that's

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:14.640
doing emotion for you.

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:17.920
Now, of course, as
well-trained ethologists,

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:21.120
you should immediately be having
a relevant thought already,

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.100
which is, well,
so what's up with

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:27.740
the [? rhinencephalon-fame ?]
nose-brain limbic system

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:31.540
in a species that's not
some smelly rodent thing?

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:33.120
In a species, for
example, that's

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:37.190
paying attention to an enormous
amount of, say, auditory stuff.

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:39.480
How about all those
birds, with the birdsong

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:43.380
business going on, or auditory
displays of territoriality,

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:44.700
or things of that sort?

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:47.190
And you look in those
brains, and the limbic system

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:51.550
is not the rhinencephalon, in
terms of what part of the brain

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:55.050
is disproportionately enlarged
and what part of the brain

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:57.800
is sending projections
into the limbic system.

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.600
Look at a bird brain, and
it is not a rhinencephalon,

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:03.870
it's an ear encephalon
or something or other.

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:06.720
And you've got to think
like an ethologist.

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:09.000
And suddenly you're
in a world where

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.210
something as bizarre as electric
fish, who communicate socially

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:17.030
through electricity,
have electroreceptors

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:18.790
which are sending a
lot of information

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:20.250
to this part of the brain.

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:24.530
It is not the nose-brain, it
is the, among other things,

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:26.370
"getting whatever
sensory information

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:28.660
is most pertinent to
my emotional life"

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:29.860
part of the brain.

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:32.640
So the limbic system,
initially utterly viewed

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:36.430
as intertwined with olfaction,
now instead recognizing,

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:40.150
as good neuroethologists,
what it's really about.

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:40.750
OK.

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:42.870
So, as an introduction
to it, we need

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:47.560
to start off with a very
simplified, quick overview

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.170
of large parts of
the nervous system.

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:50.960
You got bits of this last week.

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:52.770
But, just to give
an initial overview,

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:54.920
here, just to orient
what's happening.

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:58.010
And what we see, here--
and, again, a very accurate,

00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:00.800
technically drawn diagram--
you see the brain comes

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.220
in three different pieces.

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:04.560
And each one has
a different color.

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:07.970
And this reflects the work of
a guy named Paul MacLean, one

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:09.910
of the giants in the field.

00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:13.000
And everyone is required to
say his name, at this point.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.540
And this model that he came
up with in the 1950s or so--

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:21.030
the triune brain-- the
three-layer model of what

00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:22.860
brain function is about.

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:29.920
So what you have is the most
central, ancient, archaic, most

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:32.730
phylogenetically
conserved-- which is a fancy

00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:36.110
way of saying that, all sorts
of vertebrates out there,

00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:38.640
this part of the brain
is basically the same.

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:42.640
This is the hypothalamus,
talking to the pituitary.

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:46.260
This is the pathways going
from the hypothalamus

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:50.325
down the spinal-cord
areas called "brain stem,"

00:08:50.325 --> 00:08:51.240
"mid brain."

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:55.910
This is what MacLean called the
"reptilian" part of the brain,

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:58.800
reflecting the fact
that our section, here,

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:02.960
is a whole lot like the type
you would find in a reptile.

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:06.760
This is the ancient stuff that
does the purely automatic,

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:08.610
regulatory things.

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:12.100
You've got neurons, here, that
have to tell you something

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:14.262
about temperature regulation.

00:09:14.262 --> 00:09:17.120
Ooh, back to that
endocrinology stuff.

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:17.680
Let's see.

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:19.800
What's a hormone
that's got something

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:24.560
to do with metabolism, body
temperature, thyroid hormone?

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:28.800
So you remember the hypothalamus
being part of that cascade.

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:31.250
The hypothalamus has
a relevant hormone

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:34.280
for the pituitary, which
then tells your thyroid

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:35.340
gland all of that.

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:38.430
So how does the hypothalamus
need to know what's going on?

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:42.230
That same feedback information
stuff from the other day.

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:44.430
There's got to be neurons
in the hypothalamus that

00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:45.720
can tell your temperature.

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:47.470
And-- too cold?

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:49.670
Let's get some more
thyroid hormone out.

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:50.180
Great.

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:53.430
That makes complete sense,
in terms of regulatory loops.

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:54.620
Totally boring.

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:55.120
OK.

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:57.580
So this is a part of the
brain that keeps your body

00:09:57.580 --> 00:09:58.980
temperature right.

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:02.810
It keeps your blood glucose
levels sort of modulated

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:03.570
in some ways.

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:05.710
It talks a lot to the pancreas.

00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:09.330
It does stuff like-- it's
monitoring your blood pressure

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:11.720
in various places,
it's remembering

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:14.970
that you're running hard,
so let's tell the heart

00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:16.540
to beat a little bit faster.

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:18.150
Completely boring stuff.

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:22.950
Just robotic, regulatory
circuitry and loops, there.

00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:25.960
So this ancient, reptilian
part of the brain.

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:27.470
Totally boring
part of the brain--

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:30.360
until you get something wrong
with that part of the brain,

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:32.830
and suddenly it seems
mighty interesting.

00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:35.880
Remind me-- how many
of you were in Biocore?

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:37.120
OK, lots of folks.

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:39.020
People in there will
remember, I told you

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:41.860
about one of the
all-time creepy diseases

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:43.740
that you do not
want to get, which

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:45.980
is called "Ondine's
curse," which

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:49.020
is where you get some
lesions, some stroke damage,

00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:51.360
to one of these midbrain areas.

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:54.630
This part of the brain that
does something very boring,

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:56.520
until it doesn't do
it for you anymore.

00:10:56.520 --> 00:11:01.120
Ondine was apparently some
Greek nymph or something

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:04.660
that Zeus was hitting on
unsuccessfully at some point

00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:06.110
and greatly frustrated.

00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:08.470
He put this Olympian
curse on her,

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:10.750
which was that she
had Ondine's curse.

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:12.380
Or maybe Ondine's
curse was what she

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:13.970
had to say about him in return.

00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:17.850
But what this was about
is, she lost the capacity

00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:21.870
to do automatic breathing.

00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:23.020
Whoa!

00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:24.350
That's a drag!

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:26.102
Automatic breathing,
in that you're

00:11:26.102 --> 00:11:28.435
just sort of going along,
there, breathing now and then.

00:11:28.435 --> 00:11:32.860
And we do that pretty eptly,
as opposed to ineptly.

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:36.020
And what you don't have
to do is stop and say,

00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:39.160
whoa-- this would be a good
time to expand my diaphragm,

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:40.750
or whatever it is you do there.

00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:43.090
But you've got a lesion
in this part of the brain,

00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:47.220
and you lose the capacity
for automatic breathing.

00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:49.800
OK, somebody who's
not in Biocore,

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:54.960
tell me what do you die of,
if you have Ondine's curse?

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:56.610
Oop-- who just mumbled that?

00:11:56.610 --> 00:11:57.840
[INAUDIBLE] asphyxiation.

00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:59.590
Asphyxiation, good.

00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:01.925
OK, and at what particular time?

00:12:01.925 --> 00:12:02.800
When you fall asleep?

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:03.650
Yeah.

00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:05.760
Or, you actually don't
die of asphyxiation

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:07.250
when you're falling asleep.

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:08.360
How come?

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:10.970
Because you keep waking up.

00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:13.120
You fall asleep, and
30 seconds later you

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:16.620
wake up because you're on
the edge of asphyxiation.

00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:19.020
You die of sleep deprivation.

00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:22.450
How's that for one creepy
thing to have happen to you?

00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:25.510
So you can start obsessing over
that, as an eventual problem.

00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:28.980
Here's the boring part of the
brain, this reptilian stuff.

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:31.890
We do this part of the
brain exactly the same way

00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:33.190
that lizards do.

00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:36.250
Sitting on top of it
is the area that we now

00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:38.240
put all of our
attention and love

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:42.080
upon, which is the limbic
system, this emotional part

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:45.560
of the brain which we will
soon see in sickening detail.

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:49.530
The limbic system is mostly
a mammalian invention.

00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:53.840
Birds, reptiles, fish do
not have especially complex

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:54.680
emotional lives.

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:57.070
Uh-oh-- there's people from
Russ Fernald's lab in here.

00:12:57.070 --> 00:12:59.360
Do not tell him
I just said that.

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:00.100
But--

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:01.600
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:02.120
Yeah.

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:04.000
Not a word about it.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:04.620
OK.

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:07.560
But it is mostly a
mammalian invention,

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:09.940
greatly expanding
the limbic system,

00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:12.640
emotional complexity--
stay tuned.

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:14.980
The next hour and a
half is about what

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:16.820
is much more subtle
than saying ooh,

00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:18.620
this does emotions for you.

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:22.700
Sitting on top is the
cortex, the gleaming,

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:27.060
analytical machine of cortical
function and cognitive

00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:28.770
expertise that we have.

00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:32.140
This is something that all
sorts of species out there--

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:36.650
fish and birds and-- not bees,
but birds and almost bees.

00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:40.440
And what you got there is one
that nonetheless is greatly

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:43.210
expanded in
vertebrates and mammals

00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:46.350
and greatly expanded,
even more so, in primates

00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:48.450
and even more so than in us.

00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:51.590
And, as we will see, one
area of the cortex which

00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:55.910
is really very uniquely
human and very intertwined

00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:57.440
with the limbic system.

00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:01.260
As we'll see, what is critical
in making sense of the cortex,

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.820
with respect to all this
stuff-- this limbic,

00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:06.130
emotion, behavior
stuff, and everything

00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:07.620
coming for the rest
of the course--

00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:10.380
is the rumors of
the cortex being

00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:14.930
this rational, independent,
analytical part of the brain

00:14:14.930 --> 00:14:16.910
that goes about its
business while all

00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:20.570
this hormonal-emotional muck
is going on south of it,

00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:22.240
is completely wrong.

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:25.060
All sorts of aspects
of cortical function

00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:29.370
are being influenced by
hormones and thus, indirectly,

00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:31.690
under the regulation
of here, all sorts

00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:34.770
of aspects of cortical
function are being influenced

00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:36.170
by the limbic system.

00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:38.180
And all you have
to do to appreciate

00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:43.110
that is think back on times
of extreme emotional duress

00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:48.170
and arousal where you made some
incredibly stupid decision that

00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:50.720
seemed like a brilliant
idea at the time.

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:53.830
Therein is proof that
your limbic system

00:14:53.830 --> 00:14:56.760
is able to influence
decision-making going on

00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:58.530
up in the cortex.

00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:01.310
And, as we will see, of
great relevance to us

00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:05.330
as a fancy species-- the
cortex has vast ability

00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:07.880
to influence stuff
going on below there.

00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:11.110
And all you need to do to
prove that is sit and think

00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:13.960
about the fact that you are
not going to live forever.

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:15.670
And suddenly this
part of the brain

00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:18.880
is going to be kicking out
CRH and things like that.

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:20.680
And you've just done
it with thought.

00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:23.710
There's bidirectionality
that completely

00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:26.440
does in the notion that--
here's the emotional part

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:28.640
of the brain, here's
the cognitive part.

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:31.080
And that's completely,
completely wrong,

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:32.530
that they're separable.

00:15:32.530 --> 00:15:34.530
Major figure in the
field-- a guy named

00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:37.789
Antonio Damasio, who's probably
the best thinker about any

00:15:37.789 --> 00:15:39.580
of this stuff, had a
book a number of years

00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:42.180
ago called Descartes' Error.

00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:44.000
Descartes, who
saw that there was

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.840
this great potential separation
between thought and emotion.

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:49.900
And that's complete nonsense.

00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:53.730
So, starting off merely on
an anatomical level-- which

00:15:53.730 --> 00:15:58.330
is to say, which neurons where
are sending axonal projections

00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:00.913
where else-- tons
and tons of cross

00:16:00.913 --> 00:16:04.720
talk between the limbic
system and the cortex.

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:05.370
OK.

00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:08.540
So we now have this
utterly undefined mass

00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:10.186
of limbic system.

00:16:10.186 --> 00:16:13.340
And we also have a
tabula rasa there.

00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:14.820
But-- here it is.

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:15.510
OK.

00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:17.820
But what you've
got is, of course,

00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:21.780
subparts of the limbic system--
subparts out the wazoo.

00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:25.470
There are people who spend
their entire lives arguing about

00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:28.740
whether this subsubnuclei
of this part of the brain

00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:31.260
should logically be
considered as having seven

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:33.340
subparts or eight subparts.

00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:36.480
Extremely complicated
part of the brain.

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:39.650
And what we'll been looking
at, here, is the circuitry.

00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:42.950
The circuitry, and what
each individual subregion

00:16:42.950 --> 00:16:44.530
of the limbic system does.

00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:47.740
All of this got sorted
out in the 1930s

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:51.370
or so by a neurologist
named James Papez.

00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:54.440
And I think there remains
enormous controversy over

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:57.030
whether his name is pronounced
"papes" or "pap-ez."

00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:59.290
But probably neither is correct.

00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:02.280
But what you wound up getting,
as a result of his work,

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:04.630
was the first person
to begin to think

00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:09.089
in a systematic way of,
hey, all of these structures

00:17:09.089 --> 00:17:12.569
in that old rhinencephalon
part of the brain-- all

00:17:12.569 --> 00:17:16.280
of these structures are sending
projections to each other.

00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:20.720
There seems to be some organized
module of interconnected

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:21.530
function.

00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:23.369
And it was around
that time that people

00:17:23.369 --> 00:17:26.300
began to be seeing what
some of the effects were,

00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:29.040
what some of the roles of these
were-- behavior-- and suddenly

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:32.430
out comes the-- this is the
emotional part of the brain.

00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:36.480
And the circuitry that's
since been delineated is known

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:39.080
as the "Papez circuit,"
or the "Pap-ez" circuit,

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:41.340
or the whatever the
guy's name was circuit.

00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:42.890
And we will see that shortly.

00:17:42.890 --> 00:17:46.010
He was the first person
to begin to see, just

00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:49.500
on the level of
connections, that this

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:51.370
is an area that
seems to be doing

00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:54.090
a lot of interrelated functions.

00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:55.340
Quick definition.

00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:57.930
What do we mean by
"doing connections"?

00:17:57.930 --> 00:18:01.100
Again, back to last
week's introductory stuff,

00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:04.320
a connection, a
projection-- neurons

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:07.990
in this part of the brain
are sending their axons

00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:11.310
to that part of the brain
and forming synapses there.

00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:14.430
This area projects to that area.

00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:16.130
So where are the projections?

00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:18.300
Where are the
connections to translate

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:20.550
this neuroanatomy
concept into sort

00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:22.000
of the most accessible level?

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.720
What parts of the brain
are talking to this region?

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:29.230
And what parts of the brain
is this region talking to?

00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:32.770
Where are the axons coming from,
and where are these neurons'

00:18:32.770 --> 00:18:34.990
axons heading off to?

00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:37.330
So, circuitry, in that regard.

00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:40.796
So this is going to be an
enormously complicated circuit.

00:18:40.796 --> 00:18:42.170
But, at the end
of the day, there

00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:45.420
is one way to think about
it, which is unifying,

00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:47.340
which clarifies
everything, which

00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:51.540
is the thing that every
single nucleus and subnucleus

00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:54.100
and subsubnucleus in the
limbic system-- the thing

00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:56.880
that everything in the
limbic system wants to do

00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:59.440
is tell the
hypothalamus what to do.

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:02.040
The entire limbic
system is structured

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:06.649
around trying to influence
hypothalamic function.

00:19:06.649 --> 00:19:08.690
There's all those connections
going to the cortex

00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:10.150
and other areas, as well.

00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:13.020
But, for a first pass,
the way to conceptualize

00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:16.350
the limbic system is,
it tries to influence

00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:18.760
what the hypothalamus is up to.

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:20.540
Why would that be interesting?

00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:23.540
You know that, from last week.

00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:27.250
Hypothalamus is the
central hub for all

00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:29.520
of that neuroendocrine stuff.

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:32.090
And thus the entire
world of your brain

00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:36.010
wanting to influence behavior
and emotion in any sort

00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:38.160
of endocrine
context-- you're going

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:40.170
to have to be talking down here.

00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:42.580
From earlier last
week, hypothalamus

00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:46.610
also playing a pivotal role in
the autonomic nervous system

00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:48.190
coming down the spine.

00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:50.920
The whole world
in which emotions

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:55.540
change how your body works is
all about the limbic system

00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:58.320
telling the
hypothalamus what to do.

00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:01.960
And thus what you see is,
all the circuitry in here

00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:04.350
is built around
trying to influence

00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:06.120
hypothalamic function.

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:09.200
In a certain way, as follows--
which will make perfect sense.

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:12.230
Which is, what every single
area of the limbic system

00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:15.010
wants to do is tell the
hypothalamus what to do.

00:20:15.010 --> 00:20:17.950
And in addition, the other
thing that it really wants to do

00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:20.300
is make sure no other
part of the limbic system

00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:22.630
is telling the
hypothalamus what to do.

00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:24.860
And thus you've got
all sorts of areas

00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:28.470
with means of stimulating
regions of the hypothalamus

00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:33.420
and inhibiting the activity
of other limbic regions.

00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:35.620
So you've got all
these patterns, here,

00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:38.910
of stimulating down
there, inhibiting here--

00:20:38.910 --> 00:20:42.370
all built around these different
regions wanting to influence

00:20:42.370 --> 00:20:43.990
hypothalamic function.

00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:48.090
So amid it being a total,
complete mess of circuitry,

00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:51.460
one rule helps you begin
to sort out the details.

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:55.470
Which is, OK, so you've got
this area of the limbic system,

00:20:55.470 --> 00:20:57.450
and it wants to influence
the hypothalamus

00:20:57.450 --> 00:20:58.670
at the end of the day.

00:20:58.670 --> 00:21:03.180
How many synapses away
is the hypothalamus?

00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:07.500
How many neurons are
intervening between this part

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:09.980
of the limbic system
having something to say,

00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:12.970
getting action potentials,
and influencing something

00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:14.160
[INAUDIBLE] hypothalamus?

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:17.310
This winds up being a
pretty good rule of thumb,

00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:19.260
in terms of looking
at influence.

00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:23.290
You send a projection straight
into the hypothalamus--

00:21:23.290 --> 00:21:25.850
in other words, you
are one synapse away--

00:21:25.850 --> 00:21:28.470
and you're going to be having
a lot more control over what's

00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:31.380
going on there than if you
have to send a projection here,

00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:33.680
which sends one there and
there and bouncing around,

00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:36.740
and 14 synapses later
you're influencing

00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:38.220
hypothalamic function.

00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:39.110
How come?

00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:42.320
Well, for one thing,
one synapse away you're

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:44.400
going to be a lot faster.

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:48.230
And the other reason being, if
there's 14 synapses in between,

00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:50.120
everybody downstream
of you is going

00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:51.860
to have their own
opinion about things

00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:53.970
and it turns into a
game of Telephone.

00:21:53.970 --> 00:21:56.110
The most direct
way of influencing

00:21:56.110 --> 00:22:00.600
hypothalamic function is
to have as few synapses

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:02.620
in your projection as possible.

00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:05.870
And thus what you see
is, most limbic regions

00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:09.530
have a number of different ways
of getting information down

00:22:09.530 --> 00:22:11.610
to the hypothalamus,
and they differ

00:22:11.610 --> 00:22:14.070
in the number of
synapses, and thus they

00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:16.200
differ in their power.

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:19.770
And what we'll see is
just one example, here.

00:22:19.770 --> 00:22:20.930
Ah, we'll do that later.

00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:21.430
OK.

00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:23.500
So, lots of examples of that.

00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:26.820
Just to give you a sense about
something interesting in us,

00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:30.020
in terms of this rule of
how many synapses away.

00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:32.800
So we've got this limbic
part of the brain.

00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:36.710
And back to that rhinencephalon
business-- that, you know,

00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:41.950
rodents are super olfactory
and fish do whatever they do.

00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:43.594
And, again, don't tell Fernald.

00:22:43.594 --> 00:22:45.260
And all these other
species have their--

00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:48.550
And we're not a particularly
olfactory species.

00:22:48.550 --> 00:22:50.300
Here's something interesting.

00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:53.670
Every single one of
your sensory modalities

00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:57.690
has to go through a minimum
of three or four synapses

00:22:57.690 --> 00:23:00.010
to first plunk
down any influence

00:23:00.010 --> 00:23:05.130
in the limbic system-- except
for our olfactory systems,

00:23:05.130 --> 00:23:08.780
which are one synapse away
from the limbic system.

00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:11.600
So even us, we are not
terribly olfactory,

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:14.550
and we've got atrophied
olfactory bulbs.

00:23:14.550 --> 00:23:15.560
That's a rat.

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:19.440
Our olfactory system takes
up less than 5% of our brain.

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:22.890
Nonetheless, olfaction
is one synapse away

00:23:22.890 --> 00:23:24.830
from the limbic
system, telling you

00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:26.540
something about
that whole world,

00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:28.730
that visual information
can tell you

00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:30.780
a lot about calculus equations.

00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:34.260
Olfaction is the thing
that flashes us back

00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:36.030
to some emotional setting.

00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:37.400
That's the reason for it.

00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:41.110
Great example of this "counting
the number of synapses"

00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:42.130
strategies.

00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:45.500
The fewer synapses,
the more influence.

00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:48.530
So, what are the structures
of the limbic system?

00:23:48.530 --> 00:23:51.340
First pass--
unfortunately, it is

00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:54.570
going to make sense to
learn all the details

00:23:54.570 --> 00:23:57.060
of these different subregions,
because you will be hearing

00:23:57.060 --> 00:23:58.516
about all of them again.

00:23:58.516 --> 00:24:00.390
You won't be hearing
about them Monday night,

00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:03.690
but you'll be hearing about them
all in the next month or so.

00:24:03.690 --> 00:24:06.400
And so learn the stuff.

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:07.100
OK.

00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:09.640
So, what's going on
in the limbic system?

00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:12.080
What is inside here?

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:14.640
What we've got are
the major structures

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:15.760
of the limbic system.

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:18.560
Sitting in there, you
recognize the pituitary.

00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:21.650
And thus sitting right on top
of that is the hypothalamus.

00:24:21.650 --> 00:24:24.330
And here we have all
these other regions.

00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:27.130
First off-- the amygdala.

00:24:27.130 --> 00:24:28.880
The amygdala-- I have
already mentioned

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:30.570
it a number of times in class.

00:24:30.570 --> 00:24:33.350
We will hear details
soon about what it does.

00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:36.130
You've already heard
some intimations of it.

00:24:36.130 --> 00:24:40.620
So the amygdala is this
cluster of neurons--

00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:44.190
beginning to get another
anatomical concept, here.

00:24:44.190 --> 00:24:49.820
You've got nuclei-- clusters
of neuronal cell bodies--

00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:54.620
and you have projections--
areas of lots of axons.

00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:59.220
So you will have a whole
lot of cell bodies here

00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:02.980
and sending their
projections off there.

00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:06.880
You will wind up seeing this as
a densely packed area of cell

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:07.670
bodies.

00:25:07.670 --> 00:25:10.350
Each one of these areas
I will be mentioning now

00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:14.250
are areas where the
cell bodies are nuclei.

00:25:14.250 --> 00:25:15.630
Interesting elaboration.

00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:17.760
As you also learned
last week, one

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:20.670
of the things that makes action
potentials go really fast

00:25:20.670 --> 00:25:23.670
is that business about
myelin-- myelination.

00:25:23.670 --> 00:25:27.100
These are very membranous
wrappings-around.

00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:31.040
Membrane-- very fatty,
membrane lipid stuff,

00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:33.620
which happens to
be white in color.

00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:36.960
Cell bodies tend to
be grey in color.

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:38.900
And this is where
the dichotomy comes

00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:42.610
in brain science between
grey-matter and white-matter

00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:43.800
parts of the brain.

00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:48.160
Grey matter are nuclei--
cell bodies, packed in there.

00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:52.760
White matter are cables of
axons going from one place

00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:54.830
to another, wrapped in myelin.

00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:57.850
So, just translating
that into sort of terms

00:25:57.850 --> 00:25:59.070
that we're familiar with.

00:25:59.070 --> 00:26:03.016
OK, so, starting off-- the first
nucleus of the limbic system,

00:26:03.016 --> 00:26:04.610
the amygdala.

00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:07.480
The amygdala-- if you
study neuroanatomy,

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:09.450
most of these places
come with some terms

00:26:09.450 --> 00:26:12.150
derived from Latin or Greek
or something or other.

00:26:12.150 --> 00:26:16.360
And the amygdala--
"amygdala" means "almond."

00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:18.250
It means "almond."

00:26:18.250 --> 00:26:19.730
A number of years
ago, I reported

00:26:19.730 --> 00:26:23.530
that it means "peach pit," and
that turned out to be wrong.

00:26:23.530 --> 00:26:25.944
And I was also wrong as to
whether it was Greek or Latin.

00:26:25.944 --> 00:26:27.360
And I probably
should have written

00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:28.840
that down from two years ago.

00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:31.990
But, from some stupid
old classic language,

00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:33.140
this means "almond."

00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:37.050
And it looks like an almond.

00:26:37.050 --> 00:26:37.750
OK.

00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:41.000
Next, we have, in front
of it, the hippocampus.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.180
Hippocampus, which we will
hear lots about, as well.

00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:46.060
And you will see
the hippocampus is

00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:50.600
a big structure spanning over
there relevant to its function.

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:52.902
"Hippocampus," Latin
for "seahorse."

00:26:52.902 --> 00:26:54.360
But if you look at
the hippocampus,

00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:55.984
it doesn't look at
all like a seahorse,

00:26:55.984 --> 00:26:58.000
suggesting neuroanatomists
don't go out

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.160
to the beach anywhere near as
often as would be a good idea.

00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:03.310
It actually looks
like a jelly roll.

00:27:03.310 --> 00:27:07.520
But people who spoke Latin
didn't know about jelly rolls,

00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:10.710
and thus they had
to-- seahorses.

00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:12.210
So you've got the
hippocampus, here.

00:27:12.210 --> 00:27:15.630
We will shortly be seeing
how these two communicate

00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:17.970
with each other--
where the axons are

00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:19.510
going between these nuclei.

00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:22.390
Next, an area
called the "septum."

00:27:22.390 --> 00:27:24.670
And there's a number
of septums in the body.

00:27:24.670 --> 00:27:27.660
"Septum" is a term for
a midline structure.

00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:31.770
You have a septum separating
the two nostrilly parts

00:27:31.770 --> 00:27:32.670
of your nose.

00:27:32.670 --> 00:27:35.440
The center of the four chambers
of your heart is a septum.

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:38.000
"Septum," here, is
a structure that's

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.020
right at the midbrain-- at
the midline of the brain.

00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:44.680
Then we have, just tucked
behind the hippocampus,

00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:46.820
something called the
"mammillary bodies."

00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:48.950
Yeah, you gotta
know these terms.

00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:52.460
You will eventually
be so, so grateful

00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:55.360
for having all this stupid
terminology under your belt.

00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:59.350
It will make the rest of
your life far, far richer.

00:27:59.350 --> 00:27:59.850
OK.

00:27:59.850 --> 00:28:01.470
So you've got
mammillary body here.

00:28:01.470 --> 00:28:04.860
Sitting on top of that is a
remarkable structure that you

00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:06.830
probably could have
intuited was there,

00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:09.340
because you know about
the hypothalamus.

00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:10.910
"Hypothalamus"--
what does that mean?

00:28:10.910 --> 00:28:13.189
It means it's the thing
that's under the thalamus.

00:28:13.189 --> 00:28:15.480
I bet you there's something
a little bit north of there

00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:16.410
called the thalamus.

00:28:16.410 --> 00:28:17.330
And here it is.

00:28:17.330 --> 00:28:22.780
Which is possibly also known as
the "hypersuprahypothalamus,"

00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:24.620
but instead it's known
as the "thalamus."

00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:27.280
And we will see some
stuff that it does.

00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:31.090
Next are two very
interesting areas,

00:28:31.090 --> 00:28:34.220
which we will hear tons
about in lectures to come--

00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:37.680
in particular the lectures on
depression-- a region called

00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:42.580
the "ventral tegmental area"
and a region called the "nucleus

00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:43.630
accumbens."

00:28:43.630 --> 00:28:46.290
Every one of these
is in the handouts.

00:28:46.290 --> 00:28:48.830
Don't freak out about trying
to get down the terms,

00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:49.670
at this point.

00:28:49.670 --> 00:28:51.650
Just at least get
the abbreviations.

00:28:51.650 --> 00:28:55.280
Here are the major players
in the limbic system--

00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:57.100
with one addition.

00:28:57.100 --> 00:29:01.280
And this is one that bedeviled
the field for a long time

00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:04.910
and reflected a very, very
great piece of insight.

00:29:04.910 --> 00:29:08.510
A neuroanatomist back-- who
sort of was in his prime

00:29:08.510 --> 00:29:10.500
in the latter part
of the last century--

00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:13.430
a guy named Walle
Nauta, a Dutch guy

00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:18.710
who was arguably the best
neuroanatomist of the last half

00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:19.820
of the 20th century.

00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:22.820
And in the 1950s, studying
neural connectiveness,

00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:27.180
what he came up with was
a totally nutty idea.

00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:29.880
Because, at that point,
we were about 20-- "we"--

00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:33.510
were about 10, 20 years
into the limbic concept.

00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:37.520
These are subcortical
areas involved in emotion,

00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:39.670
and they all send
projections to each other.

00:29:39.670 --> 00:29:43.510
And Nauta, based on looking
at the anatomy-- what

00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:46.590
parts of the brain were sending
projections where, what parts

00:29:46.590 --> 00:29:50.190
were getting projections
from where-- Nauta said,

00:29:50.190 --> 00:29:53.470
one part of the cortex
should actually be classified

00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:55.270
as part of the limbic system.

00:29:55.270 --> 00:29:57.090
Oh, this was heresy!

00:29:57.090 --> 00:30:00.260
He was driven out of
the neuroanatomy club.

00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:03.880
And he was insisting that
this made sense, anatomically,

00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:06.180
and predicted it would
make sense, eventually,

00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:07.150
functionally.

00:30:07.150 --> 00:30:08.930
And he was totally right.

00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:12.370
The most interesting area
of the cortex-- a region

00:30:12.370 --> 00:30:14.410
called the "frontal cortex."

00:30:14.410 --> 00:30:16.800
Also known as the
"prefrontal cortex."

00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:18.780
An obviously real
distinction there.

00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:20.890
We will ignore that distinction.

00:30:20.890 --> 00:30:24.660
An area-- the frontal
cortex, including a subarea

00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:26.740
called the "anterior cingulate."

00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:29.580
This is a part of
the cortex which

00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:32.380
is intimately
interconnected with all

00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:34.370
these subcortical regions.

00:30:34.370 --> 00:30:38.790
It is arguably the cortical
component of the limbic system.

00:30:38.790 --> 00:30:40.430
Why is that the case?

00:30:40.430 --> 00:30:44.340
We will see, amid lots of
cortex [INAUDIBLE] stuff,

00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:47.390
like, telling you, is it here
that you were just stimulated,

00:30:47.390 --> 00:30:48.500
or was it there?

00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:50.990
Did somebody just play
an A or an A flat?

00:30:50.990 --> 00:30:53.210
Which limb do I want
to move right now?

00:30:53.210 --> 00:30:55.330
All sorts of
nuts-and-bolts stuff.

00:30:55.330 --> 00:30:57.450
How do I do long division?

00:30:57.450 --> 00:30:58.570
All those things.

00:30:58.570 --> 00:31:02.950
The frontal cortex has this
world of utterly un-cortex-like

00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:05.150
things that it's interested in.

00:31:05.150 --> 00:31:11.460
Emotional regulation, impulse
control, long-term planning,

00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:13.590
gratification postponement.

00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:16.230
It is, without question,
the most interesting part

00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:17.130
of the brain.

00:31:17.130 --> 00:31:20.740
And I say that as
someone who's just spent,

00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:23.350
like, the last 30
years of my life

00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:27.010
just obsessing over the
hippocampus, and I was wrong.

00:31:27.010 --> 00:31:29.320
I mean, the hippocampus
has done well by me.

00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:30.830
I have been faithful to it.

00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:32.862
But nonetheless it has
struck me, more and more,

00:31:32.862 --> 00:31:35.320
that this is where I should
have been sitting, because this

00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:38.160
is oh so much more
interesting part of the brain

00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:41.130
than some dumb old area that
remembers stuff for you.

00:31:41.130 --> 00:31:45.650
Frontal cortex is what makes
us most definedly human.

00:31:45.650 --> 00:31:49.190
It is proportionately
larger in humans

00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:50.630
than in any other species.

00:31:50.630 --> 00:31:52.670
It is the most recently evolved.

00:31:52.670 --> 00:31:54.960
Something that we will
hear about in coming weeks

00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:58.790
is, it's the last part of
the brain to fully mature.

00:31:58.790 --> 00:32:01.200
Most of you in here
do not yet have

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:04.270
a frontal cortex which
is fully online-- which

00:32:04.270 --> 00:32:06.150
is an amazing thing.

00:32:06.150 --> 00:32:08.420
Frontal cortex isn't
fully myelinated

00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:11.280
until in your mid-20s,
on the average.

00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:13.470
This is not-- oh, you
were born with all

00:32:13.470 --> 00:32:14.700
these neural connections.

00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:18.390
This is a part of the brain that
does impulse control for you.

00:32:18.390 --> 00:32:21.500
And it is not working yet very
well, in most of you guys,

00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:22.810
for a while to come.

00:32:22.810 --> 00:32:24.860
I don't know what this
explains, but it no doubt

00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:26.160
explains a great deal.

00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:28.400
This is an incredibly
interesting part

00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:30.860
of the brain which has
nothing to do with--

00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:32.950
oh, let's turn that
sensory information

00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:34.770
into a three-dimensional
map, and I could

00:32:34.770 --> 00:32:36.420
recognize whose face it is.

00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:40.750
And this instead is a cortical
area utterly intertwined

00:32:40.750 --> 00:32:43.540
with what's going on
in the limbic system.

00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:45.760
One interesting
measure of it, which

00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:50.000
is looking at this frontal
part of the cortical brain.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.580
And an interesting
measure, worked on by a guy

00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:55.780
named Ian Dunbar some
years ago, looking at,

00:32:55.780 --> 00:32:59.430
by now, about 150
different primate species.

00:32:59.430 --> 00:33:02.920
And, in each one, asking,
what percentage of the brain

00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:05.640
is made up by this
prefrontal cortex?

00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:08.180
How much of the brain
is devoted to it?

00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:11.810
And what he showed, across 150
different primate species--

00:33:11.810 --> 00:33:15.810
the single best predictor of
how big the frontal cortex was

00:33:15.810 --> 00:33:19.440
going to be was, how large
is the average social group

00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:21.120
for this species?

00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:22.960
In other words,
you sitting around

00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:24.980
in some species where
you've got to keep track

00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:27.950
of three other people in
there, or you live in a species

00:33:27.950 --> 00:33:31.070
where there's 150
individuals in your troop.

00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:34.150
And the latter species is
going to have proportionally

00:33:34.150 --> 00:33:36.070
a far bigger frontal cortex.

00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:38.610
What this suggests,
on a certain level,

00:33:38.610 --> 00:33:42.330
is, this utterly defining
part of the brain

00:33:42.330 --> 00:33:46.410
evolved for gossip
and social relations

00:33:46.410 --> 00:33:50.230
and appropriate behavior
and social intelligence

00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:52.220
and all sorts of
stuff like that.

00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:54.440
Truly interesting
part of the brain,

00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:58.410
utterly intertwined with the
traditional limbic regions.

00:33:58.410 --> 00:34:01.640
So this Nauta guy was
completely correct.

00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:02.490
OK.

00:34:02.490 --> 00:34:06.080
So, now adding in the
next layer of miserable

00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:10.120
factoids you need to have, which
will show the same principles

00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:11.420
I've been talking about.

00:34:11.420 --> 00:34:14.679
Which is how these areas
connect with each other.

00:34:14.679 --> 00:34:16.570
At this point, it
has basically been

00:34:16.570 --> 00:34:20.239
shown that every limbic region
projects to-- sends axons

00:34:20.239 --> 00:34:21.900
to-- some other limbic region.

00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:25.389
I'm just going to put in some
of the main pathways, here.

00:34:25.389 --> 00:34:31.239
First one, called the
"amygdalofugal pathway,"

00:34:31.239 --> 00:34:34.130
which carries information back
and forth between the amygdala

00:34:34.130 --> 00:34:35.429
and hippocampus.

00:34:35.429 --> 00:34:38.179
Amygdaloid neurons projecting
to the hippocampus,

00:34:38.179 --> 00:34:40.159
hippocampal neurons
projecting back.

00:34:40.159 --> 00:34:42.672
And, as we will
see, an awful lot

00:34:42.672 --> 00:34:44.630
of what the amygdala is
involved with-- I think

00:34:44.630 --> 00:34:48.030
I've mentioned
already-- fear, anxiety,

00:34:48.030 --> 00:34:51.810
learning to be afraid
of particular stimuli.

00:34:51.810 --> 00:34:53.580
A lot of what the
hippocampus does

00:34:53.580 --> 00:34:55.360
is help you remember stuff.

00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:58.000
This connection between
them is critical

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:01.380
when you are learning that every
time the guy-- the Russian guy

00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:02.959
with the beard--
puts the light on,

00:35:02.959 --> 00:35:04.500
you're going to get
a shock, and then

00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:06.916
you're going to have to salivate
when he tells you there's

00:35:06.916 --> 00:35:07.430
food coming.

00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:11.380
What the amygdala is doing there
is hijacking the hippocampus

00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:14.870
at that time to have hippocampus
do some memory formation

00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:18.010
for you about a
fearful stimulus.

00:35:18.010 --> 00:35:21.870
So, interconnections there
that are extremely important.

00:35:21.870 --> 00:35:26.750
Next we've got hippocampus
needing to talk to the septum.

00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:31.400
And it does so with a series
of projections-- bidirectional,

00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:34.930
again-- called the "fimbria
fornix." "Fornix"--

00:35:34.930 --> 00:35:38.515
here's showing just how much fun
neuroanatomy can be. "Fornix"

00:35:38.515 --> 00:35:42.380
is from Latin or Greek
or whatever for "arch,"

00:35:42.380 --> 00:35:44.800
and apparently it comes
from referring to the Roman

00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:46.060
Colosseum.

00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:49.270
And supposedly this is the
origins of another word.

00:35:49.270 --> 00:35:51.040
That, during
classical Roman times,

00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:52.990
this is where
prostitutes would be.

00:35:52.990 --> 00:35:55.350
So people who would say
they were going off there

00:35:55.350 --> 00:35:58.740
would be going off to the
arches-- off to fornicate.

00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:00.000
That's the origins of that.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.330
So isn't this such
a cool subject?

00:36:02.330 --> 00:36:05.720
So here we've got the fornix,
there, completing this arch.

00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:08.060
Hippocampus talking to septum.

00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:11.890
Septum then sending
a huge projection,

00:36:11.890 --> 00:36:14.600
coming down to the
hypothalamus, back

00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:16.420
on to the mammillary bodies.

00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:19.220
And projections going
back this way, as well.

00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:23.840
A major, major limbic pathway
called the "medial forebrain

00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:26.660
bundle."

00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:27.700
OK.

00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:29.870
Just to make things
more complicated,

00:36:29.870 --> 00:36:32.640
now, we now have
another projection

00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:36.110
from the amygdala that goes
straight to the hypothalamus.

00:36:36.110 --> 00:36:38.410
And this is a total pain.

00:36:38.410 --> 00:36:41.630
This is a pathway called
the "stria terminalis."

00:36:41.630 --> 00:36:43.430
And, by all logic,
what it should do

00:36:43.430 --> 00:36:45.850
is go from here to there.

00:36:45.850 --> 00:36:47.470
No, that's not what it does.

00:36:47.470 --> 00:36:49.640
Here's what the stria
terminalis does.

00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:51.520
It starts in the
amygdala, and it

00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:54.780
goes looping just on the
outside of the hippocampus,

00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:58.020
around this way, and
lands back there.

00:36:58.020 --> 00:36:59.830
What's up with that?

00:36:59.830 --> 00:37:01.280
That is ridiculous.

00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:04.080
What you see, here,
is a principle

00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:07.330
about a lot of this
neurobiological wiring

00:37:07.330 --> 00:37:11.900
stuff, which is, you get
totally nutty, inefficient,

00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:14.990
you know, going out through
left field projections.

00:37:14.990 --> 00:37:16.370
How did that happen?

00:37:16.370 --> 00:37:20.020
What that tells you is, at
some point, embryologically,

00:37:20.020 --> 00:37:23.510
these two structures were
not so close to each other.

00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:25.340
And part of the
embryonic development

00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:27.670
involved flipping
over like this.

00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:30.040
And suddenly the amygdala
is right next door,

00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:34.030
long after it made the most
efficient possible connection

00:37:34.030 --> 00:37:34.940
by way of this.

00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:37.160
And now you've got this
completely nutty way

00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:38.430
to get around there.

00:37:38.430 --> 00:37:41.040
So often you see really
inefficient pieces

00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:43.610
of wiring, here,
telling you something

00:37:43.610 --> 00:37:46.340
about embryonic development.

00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:50.180
Some of the time, you also
see nutty pieces of wiring

00:37:50.180 --> 00:37:53.130
telling you something about
the evolutionary history

00:37:53.130 --> 00:37:54.420
of this nervous system.

00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:56.650
Here's one example--
and this is one outside

00:37:56.650 --> 00:37:59.280
of the limbic system but
great demonstration of this,

00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:02.370
having to do with some
motor systems in the brain.

00:38:02.370 --> 00:38:03.170
OK.

00:38:03.170 --> 00:38:05.440
You're here, and you
decide what you would like

00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:08.280
to do is bend this one finger.

00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:10.410
What would be the logical thing?

00:38:10.410 --> 00:38:14.250
Some part of the cortex up
here involved in motor control

00:38:14.250 --> 00:38:15.800
that we're not
interested in should

00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:19.190
send a message down to
this finger saying "bend."

00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:19.870
No.

00:38:19.870 --> 00:38:21.440
That's not what happens.

00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:23.480
One part of this
motor system called

00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:27.770
the "pyramidal nervous system"
sends a message to all five

00:38:27.770 --> 00:38:30.470
of your fingers
saying "do this."

00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:33.070
Meanwhile, there's another
motor system called

00:38:33.070 --> 00:38:36.620
the "extrapyramidal system"
that quickly sends down a signal

00:38:36.620 --> 00:38:39.850
and says, if you happen to
hear the pyramidal system tell

00:38:39.850 --> 00:38:43.740
fingers 1, 3, 4, and 5 to bend,
don't pay attention to it.

00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:46.265
And suddenly you've
got this going on.

00:38:46.265 --> 00:38:48.350
Like-- what is
this-- a committee

00:38:48.350 --> 00:38:49.550
that came up with this?

00:38:49.550 --> 00:38:52.710
This is totally crazy,
inefficient wiring--

00:38:52.710 --> 00:38:55.920
until you think about the
evolution of the system.

00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:59.680
As follows, there's not a
whole lot of species out there

00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:02.080
that have a need, in terms
of reproductive success,

00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:03.934
to play trills on the piano.

00:39:03.934 --> 00:39:05.350
There's not a whole
lot of species

00:39:05.350 --> 00:39:07.910
that have to do independent
movement of fingers.

00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:11.060
The basic wiring of
this motor system

00:39:11.060 --> 00:39:16.640
is one of this crude, pyramidal
system of just sending messages

00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:17.520
down the line, there.

00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:20.610
Extend claws, retract--
all that sort of thing.

00:39:20.610 --> 00:39:23.939
And along come primates and
raccoons and a few other things

00:39:23.939 --> 00:39:25.480
that suddenly get
it into their heads

00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:27.100
to move fingers independently.

00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:29.230
So you've got a
choice, at that point.

00:39:29.230 --> 00:39:32.370
You can either renovate
the entire pyramidal system

00:39:32.370 --> 00:39:35.810
and rip it out and rewire so
that each finger is controlled

00:39:35.810 --> 00:39:36.800
independently.

00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:39.240
And that's never going to
work, because, you know,

00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:42.080
the contractor doesn't show up,
and it's been a million years.

00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:44.280
Or what you do is,
you have to come up

00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:48.260
with a second, newer system
that's superimposed on top.

00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:50.660
Totally ass-backwards,
inefficient way

00:39:50.660 --> 00:39:52.300
of doing-- what
does that tell you?

00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:55.920
The extrapyramidal system
is more recently evolved.

00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:57.920
It is more of a primate system.

00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:00.140
And that's where you
get the fine control.

00:40:00.140 --> 00:40:04.660
What you often see is bits
of really clunky wiring

00:40:04.660 --> 00:40:07.960
and regulation-- tells you
things about embryonic life,

00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:09.990
and it tells you
about evolution.

00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:12.280
Back to this
classic quote, which

00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:15.020
is "Evolution is
not an inventor,

00:40:15.020 --> 00:40:16.880
evolution is a tinkerer."

00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:19.240
It is just playing with
what's already there

00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:21.140
and trying to come up
with something better.

00:40:21.140 --> 00:40:23.300
That was the idea
from lectures ago.

00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:25.260
Which, all things
considered, squid

00:40:25.260 --> 00:40:28.180
do not swim anywhere near
as fast as barracuda.

00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:30.140
But for something that
used to be a barnacle,

00:40:30.140 --> 00:40:31.640
they're pretty good swimmers.

00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:34.360
You have to realize
where things started

00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:36.670
and where the
adaptations came from.

00:40:36.670 --> 00:40:37.340
OK.

00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:38.650
So, more wiring.

00:40:38.650 --> 00:40:44.130
And now we've got the mammillary
bodies talking to the thalamus.

00:40:44.130 --> 00:40:48.310
The mammillothalamic tract.

00:40:48.310 --> 00:40:51.760
And then you've got the
thalamus talking bidirectionally

00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:53.590
with the frontal cortex.

00:40:53.590 --> 00:40:55.630
So you begin to see
the starts, here,

00:40:55.630 --> 00:40:59.030
of kind of a looping circuit,
and going bidirectionally--

00:40:59.030 --> 00:41:00.160
all of that.

00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:03.370
Two additional areas--
this ventral tegmental area

00:41:03.370 --> 00:41:05.190
and this nucleus accumbens.

00:41:05.190 --> 00:41:08.120
Ventral tegmentum sends a
lot of information here,

00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:11.050
and from on there it goes
to every single place.

00:41:11.050 --> 00:41:13.170
And we will eventually
see great relevance

00:41:13.170 --> 00:41:15.130
of that bidirectionally.

00:41:15.130 --> 00:41:15.730
OK.

00:41:15.730 --> 00:41:17.490
So, horrible circuitry.

00:41:17.490 --> 00:41:19.847
What you should already
see is one example

00:41:19.847 --> 00:41:21.930
of what I was telling you
about, before-- counting

00:41:21.930 --> 00:41:23.240
number of synapses.

00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:24.980
So you're the
amygdala, and you want

00:41:24.980 --> 00:41:27.050
to tell the
hypothalamus what to do.

00:41:27.050 --> 00:41:28.320
You've got a choice.

00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:32.360
You can do it by way of this
stria terminalis thing, which

00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:34.310
is one synapse away.

00:41:34.310 --> 00:41:37.360
Or you could do it by talking
to the hippocampus, which

00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:39.870
talks to the septum, which
talks to the hypothalamus.

00:41:39.870 --> 00:41:42.810
Where's the most important
stuff coming out of the amygdala

00:41:42.810 --> 00:41:44.040
to the hypothalamus?

00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:46.450
By way of this stria terminalis.

00:41:46.450 --> 00:41:48.750
What's this communication about?

00:41:48.750 --> 00:41:50.780
A lot of the time,
it's the amygdala

00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:53.610
trying to get the hippocampus
to shut up so the amygdala can

00:41:53.610 --> 00:41:55.590
dominate hypothalamic events.

00:41:55.590 --> 00:41:58.100
That begins to show
this principle of,

00:41:58.100 --> 00:42:00.000
how many synapses away?

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:03.000
So we have all of this
incredible wiring, here.

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:04.820
And, again, every
single one of these,

00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:06.760
there's other minor
ones there, as well,

00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:08.510
and they all interconnect
with each other.

00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:10.380
But these are some
of the major ones.

00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:13.990
Does this make sense?

00:42:13.990 --> 00:42:15.360
How about now?

00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:16.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:17.600
OK.

00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:20.660
So, that's the limbic system,
in terms of basic wiring.

00:42:20.660 --> 00:42:22.980
So what everyone
needs to do now is

00:42:22.980 --> 00:42:24.860
spend the next five
minutes filling in what

00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:27.620
those abbreviations were for.

00:42:27.620 --> 00:42:31.610
And then we will finally get
past this stupid A sends to B

00:42:31.610 --> 00:42:33.210
and begin to look at function.

00:42:33.210 --> 00:42:34.700
OK, so, five minutes.

00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:36.760
OK, so, pushing on.

00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:40.520
Good question that just came
up, relevant to Biocore people.

00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:42.350
So what I just
said-- that business

00:42:42.350 --> 00:42:45.830
about the olfactory
system is one synapse away

00:42:45.830 --> 00:42:48.230
from the limbic system--
isn't it hopefully amazing?

00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:52.080
Remember Biocore stuff-- that
business-- the visual cortex,

00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:54.800
the first layer that does
dots, the second layer

00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:57.730
does lines, at certain
angles-- that's

00:42:57.730 --> 00:43:00.080
where you're getting
all the synapses coming

00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:03.320
in which delay you from
getting information into there.

00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:07.000
Auditory system has the
same multilayer processing.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:10.880
Tactile-- all of those are like
that, except for olfaction.

00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:14.550
That drops its first signaling
right off into the amygdala.

00:43:14.550 --> 00:43:16.860
So very, very
different circuitry.

00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:17.460
OK.

00:43:17.460 --> 00:43:19.960
So, now, finally
getting to function.

00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:24.740
So how do you figure out the
function of the limbic system?

00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:26.910
A bunch of different
techniques-- bunch

00:43:26.910 --> 00:43:28.690
of different
experimental techniques.

00:43:28.690 --> 00:43:31.250
First, you have
the greatest thing

00:43:31.250 --> 00:43:33.600
that has been most
helpful in all

00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:36.060
of the history of
neuroscience in understanding

00:43:36.060 --> 00:43:39.490
how different parts of the brain
work, which is endless warfare.

00:43:39.490 --> 00:43:41.770
Because what that
gives you are people

00:43:41.770 --> 00:43:44.440
who have had parts of their
brain blown out of the water,

00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:44.950
there.

00:43:44.950 --> 00:43:48.430
You have-- nice
jargon-- missile wounds.

00:43:48.430 --> 00:43:51.690
So, after every big,
good, fun, energetic war,

00:43:51.690 --> 00:43:54.090
all sorts of neuroanatomists
get their careers,

00:43:54.090 --> 00:43:56.480
like, jump-started
for years afterward,

00:43:56.480 --> 00:44:00.470
studying people who have had
parts of the brain lesioned,

00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:04.280
damaged, destroyed by
circumstances like that.

00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:06.500
But, you know, any old
time, neuroanatomists

00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:08.600
are delighted to get
ahold of somebody who's

00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:11.420
had a brain region damaged.

00:44:11.420 --> 00:44:14.260
There's one guy, in fact--
everybody has heard of HM,

00:44:14.260 --> 00:44:14.960
I suspect.

00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:16.540
Anybody not heard of HM?

00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:19.620
OK.

00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:20.880
So you've all heard of HM.

00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:23.391
There's another guy-- NA.

00:44:23.391 --> 00:44:26.740
NA his septum taken out.

00:44:26.740 --> 00:44:28.080
And what happened to NA?

00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:30.540
All that it ever says
in the literature

00:44:30.540 --> 00:44:34.060
was that he was at a wedding
and his septum was destroyed

00:44:34.060 --> 00:44:36.360
by a miniature fencing foil.

00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:37.960
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:38.866
That's it!

00:44:38.866 --> 00:44:41.480
That's the literature
on what happened to NA.

00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:43.927
So NA, you know,
was a draft dodger

00:44:43.927 --> 00:44:45.510
in endless different
wars, and then he

00:44:45.510 --> 00:44:47.610
gets done in by his,
like, sister-in-law's

00:44:47.610 --> 00:44:49.060
wedding kind of thing.

00:44:49.060 --> 00:44:51.570
But lesions--
lesions are critical.

00:44:51.570 --> 00:44:55.150
So human studies, where you
have had accidental damage

00:44:55.150 --> 00:44:57.030
to brain regions.

00:44:57.030 --> 00:45:00.000
Or the rare,
horrifying world where

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.540
there was damage done to
human brains intentionally.

00:45:02.540 --> 00:45:05.720
Back to class 1-- the
frontal-lobotomy business.

00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:08.590
Just to clarify--
frontal lobotomies,

00:45:08.590 --> 00:45:11.620
in its classic form,
was not lesioning

00:45:11.620 --> 00:45:13.120
the prefrontal cortex.

00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:15.110
It was just putting
a big-ol' cut

00:45:15.110 --> 00:45:18.110
somewhere through there that
took out limbic structures.

00:45:18.110 --> 00:45:21.450
Given the fact that most frontal
lobotomies were being done,

00:45:21.450 --> 00:45:24.210
I kid you not, with
an ice axe-- that

00:45:24.210 --> 00:45:26.690
was the tool of choice
for the neurosurgeons--

00:45:26.690 --> 00:45:29.460
this was not a very
precise surgical technique.

00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:31.830
But it was taking out all
sorts of limbic structures.

00:45:31.830 --> 00:45:35.530
So the rare world of
intentional lesions in humans,

00:45:35.530 --> 00:45:39.190
HM being the rare version
of that, where it was done

00:45:39.190 --> 00:45:40.950
for a valid clinical reason.

00:45:40.950 --> 00:45:43.200
Much more often in
the lesion world

00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:46.390
is taking experimental
animals, where you go in

00:45:46.390 --> 00:45:48.800
and you selectively
destroy some region.

00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:51.980
And the strategy, whether
in humans or animals,

00:45:51.980 --> 00:45:54.560
is absolutely
obvious, which is, OK,

00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:58.395
if we destroy this part of the
brain, what doesn't work right

00:45:58.395 --> 00:45:58.895
anymore?

00:45:58.895 --> 00:46:01.020
Ooh, we've just found
out something about what

00:46:01.020 --> 00:46:02.590
that part of the brain does.

00:46:02.590 --> 00:46:05.010
Next strategy-- classic one.

00:46:05.010 --> 00:46:07.730
Now, instead of
lesioning a brain region,

00:46:07.730 --> 00:46:11.620
you put down an electrode where
you stimulate that region.

00:46:11.620 --> 00:46:16.110
You artificially generate
action potentials there.

00:46:16.110 --> 00:46:20.450
This is a brain region that
gets projections from here,

00:46:20.450 --> 00:46:23.200
and this region is not
saying anything whatsoever.

00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:26.980
There are no activity here to
send action potentials there.

00:46:26.980 --> 00:46:27.966
Nothing's happening.

00:46:27.966 --> 00:46:29.340
And what you're
doing instead is,

00:46:29.340 --> 00:46:32.460
by sticking an electrode
in there and stimulating,

00:46:32.460 --> 00:46:35.100
you are simulating
an input, there.

00:46:35.100 --> 00:46:37.776
Stimulate, and now
see what happens.

00:46:37.776 --> 00:46:39.150
Ooh, we've just
learned something

00:46:39.150 --> 00:46:41.210
about that part of the brain.

00:46:41.210 --> 00:46:44.260
Rarely done with humans,
except for epileptics

00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:47.090
with severe types of
intractable epilepsy

00:46:47.090 --> 00:46:49.250
where a certain
type of neurosurgery

00:46:49.250 --> 00:46:51.080
is done to correct it.

00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:52.660
And it's often quite effective.

00:46:52.660 --> 00:46:56.380
On the way down, the
electrodes, going down-- often,

00:46:56.380 --> 00:46:59.300
the neurosurgeons
stimulate on the way down,

00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:01.890
to be assured that they're
in the right place.

00:47:01.890 --> 00:47:02.570
OK.

00:47:02.570 --> 00:47:03.430
Next version.

00:47:03.430 --> 00:47:06.600
Now, instead, you put down
an electrode, and that one's

00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:08.540
a recording electrode.

00:47:08.540 --> 00:47:12.020
What that one is telling you
is-- so you're down in here--

00:47:12.020 --> 00:47:15.770
when are these neurons
getting electrically excited?

00:47:15.770 --> 00:47:19.390
Or, putting it in here, when
are action potentials pulsing

00:47:19.390 --> 00:47:23.580
through this part of the brain,
picking up what's going on?

00:47:23.580 --> 00:47:26.190
And what really
winds up being fancy

00:47:26.190 --> 00:47:29.420
are people who, for example,
can put a stimulating electrode

00:47:29.420 --> 00:47:31.720
down here and a
recording electrode

00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:33.260
there-- that sort of thing.

00:47:33.260 --> 00:47:37.040
There's a whole world of
incredibly adept people

00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:40.290
who could record from one
single neuron at a time.

00:47:40.290 --> 00:47:41.390
Or how's about this?

00:47:41.390 --> 00:47:44.480
Back to those
neurotransmitter receptors

00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:48.400
coupled to an ion channel,
an ion channel that opens up,

00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:49.860
and stuff goes in or out.

00:47:49.860 --> 00:47:52.250
There is a technique
called "patch clamping,"

00:47:52.250 --> 00:47:57.230
where people can record from one
single ion channel at a time.

00:47:57.230 --> 00:47:59.890
Which is just madness,
that people could do this.

00:47:59.890 --> 00:48:02.720
But, in terms of the resolution,
all of these techniques

00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:06.200
artificially get neurons
excited, electrically.

00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:07.930
See what happens next.

00:48:07.930 --> 00:48:11.840
Put in a recording device to
tell you what's happening.

00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:14.370
And thus you begin to
do things like, ooh,

00:48:14.370 --> 00:48:16.350
every time I do
this with my hand,

00:48:16.350 --> 00:48:18.170
these neurons get
action potentials.

00:48:18.170 --> 00:48:20.570
We've just learned
something pertinent, there.

00:48:20.570 --> 00:48:21.580
What else?

00:48:21.580 --> 00:48:24.230
Another realm of techniques
you've already heard about,

00:48:24.230 --> 00:48:26.980
which is this plain
old, boring anatomy.

00:48:26.980 --> 00:48:29.500
Which part of the
brain sends axons

00:48:29.500 --> 00:48:30.870
to this part of the brain?

00:48:30.870 --> 00:48:32.400
How many synapses away?

00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:34.860
All of the means of
deriving information

00:48:34.860 --> 00:48:36.160
that we heard about before.

00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:39.820
So that's the whole world of
just looking at the circuitry,

00:48:39.820 --> 00:48:42.460
telling you about
function from that.

00:48:42.460 --> 00:48:45.400
Then, of course, there's a whole
world of biochemical stuff.

00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:47.710
You are measuring
levels of things.

00:48:47.710 --> 00:48:50.310
You are measuring levels
of neurotransmitters.

00:48:50.310 --> 00:48:53.850
Molecular biology-- seeing
where different genes

00:48:53.850 --> 00:48:55.170
are being expressed.

00:48:55.170 --> 00:48:57.440
If you see genes that
are only expressed

00:48:57.440 --> 00:48:59.380
in this part of
the limbic system,

00:48:59.380 --> 00:49:02.070
under some circumstance,
you've just learned something

00:49:02.070 --> 00:49:03.210
about its function.

00:49:03.210 --> 00:49:04.530
All that sort of thing.

00:49:04.530 --> 00:49:08.110
Finally, a world where you
could do really interesting,

00:49:08.110 --> 00:49:10.810
trendy stuff with humans,
in terms of seeing what's

00:49:10.810 --> 00:49:12.170
up in the limbic system.

00:49:12.170 --> 00:49:16.500
Where what you do is, you
can image brain regions.

00:49:16.500 --> 00:49:18.350
And this is now a whole
world of-- instead

00:49:18.350 --> 00:49:20.320
of sitting around, waiting
for somebody to die,

00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:22.470
and slice their
brain up afterward,

00:49:22.470 --> 00:49:27.770
instead you could do imaging--
CAT scans, CT Scans, MRI--

00:49:27.770 --> 00:49:31.360
where you see the areas of
different parts in the brain--

00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:32.920
how big or small they are.

00:49:32.920 --> 00:49:34.670
You can look at
the metabolic rate

00:49:34.670 --> 00:49:36.220
in certain areas of the brain.

00:49:36.220 --> 00:49:38.990
Which is sort of the
equivalent of recording.

00:49:38.990 --> 00:49:41.180
Stick in an
electrode, and you can

00:49:41.180 --> 00:49:43.200
tell what's happening
here by when

00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:45.690
there's electrical excitation.

00:49:45.690 --> 00:49:48.090
Use functional brain
imaging, and you

00:49:48.090 --> 00:49:50.150
can tell what's
happening here by,

00:49:50.150 --> 00:49:53.240
when suddenly there's more
oxygen or glucose being

00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:54.190
consumed, here--

00:49:54.190 --> 00:49:55.730
Same sort of information.

00:49:55.730 --> 00:49:57.560
With the imaging,
though, you're getting

00:49:57.560 --> 00:50:00.545
a picture of the entire
brain all at once.

00:50:00.545 --> 00:50:01.920
And one of the
cool things that's

00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:03.980
come out of those
studies is showing

00:50:03.980 --> 00:50:07.940
that some regions of the brain,
particularly the limbic system,

00:50:07.940 --> 00:50:10.849
will change their
size over time.

00:50:10.849 --> 00:50:12.390
One example which
I think we've heard

00:50:12.390 --> 00:50:16.460
about already, which is that
the amygdala gets bigger

00:50:16.460 --> 00:50:19.510
in people with posttraumatic
stress disorder.

00:50:19.510 --> 00:50:23.460
Severe, severe traumatic
history, and this part

00:50:23.460 --> 00:50:25.030
of the brain expands.

00:50:25.030 --> 00:50:28.320
People with PTSD--
amygdalas are larger.

00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:31.040
You look at the metabolic
rate in the amygdala.

00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:34.940
People with PTSD, it is
more metabolically reactive

00:50:34.940 --> 00:50:37.560
than other areas of the
brain or than in people

00:50:37.560 --> 00:50:39.460
who don't have PTSD.

00:50:39.460 --> 00:50:41.620
So that's just told you
something interesting.

00:50:41.620 --> 00:50:43.880
Nice cellular basis of that.

00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:46.930
Periods of severe
stress cause neurons

00:50:46.930 --> 00:50:50.550
in the amygdala to grow
more dendritic processes.

00:50:50.550 --> 00:50:53.040
That's probably why the
amygdala gets bigger.

00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:55.010
So that's the sort of
thing that gets picked up

00:50:55.010 --> 00:50:57.990
on humans, with brain imaging.

00:50:57.990 --> 00:51:00.470
Another version, over
in the hippocampus,

00:51:00.470 --> 00:51:03.310
just as pertinent to some of
the stuff we will hear about.

00:51:03.310 --> 00:51:06.260
People with long-term,
major depression.

00:51:06.260 --> 00:51:08.850
Their hippocampus gets smaller.

00:51:08.850 --> 00:51:11.510
Their hippocampus
atrophies a bit.

00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:14.420
And the same sort of
information being picked up.

00:51:14.420 --> 00:51:16.430
You see an area
of the brain that

00:51:16.430 --> 00:51:20.140
is plastic enough, that is
malleable enough, that its size

00:51:20.140 --> 00:51:23.450
will change in response to
certain types of experiences

00:51:23.450 --> 00:51:24.580
or emotional states.

00:51:24.580 --> 00:51:27.791
You just learned something about
what that part of the brain

00:51:27.791 --> 00:51:28.290
does.

00:51:28.290 --> 00:51:31.230
So that winds up being
extremely informative,

00:51:31.230 --> 00:51:33.880
when there's differences in
the size of different brain

00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:36.520
regions, in response
to experience.

00:51:36.520 --> 00:51:37.090
OK.

00:51:37.090 --> 00:51:39.700
So that's generally
the set of tools

00:51:39.700 --> 00:51:42.160
that are available to people
trying to figure out what's

00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:43.890
going on in the limbic system.

00:51:43.890 --> 00:51:47.690
And all of these tools come
with some important limitations.

00:51:47.690 --> 00:51:50.220
These are limitations if
what you're trying to do

00:51:50.220 --> 00:51:53.100
is figure out what this
part of the spinal column

00:51:53.100 --> 00:51:55.140
does instead of that
part, because you

00:51:55.140 --> 00:51:57.510
need to figure out-- all
sorts of caveats in there.

00:51:57.510 --> 00:52:00.970
If that's hard, it is a
gazillion times harder

00:52:00.970 --> 00:52:02.700
to use some of these
techniques to make

00:52:02.700 --> 00:52:05.940
sense of emotion and
emotional memories and things

00:52:05.940 --> 00:52:06.600
of that sort.

00:52:06.600 --> 00:52:08.380
What are some of
the difficulties

00:52:08.380 --> 00:52:11.180
in interpreting data from
all the results we just

00:52:11.180 --> 00:52:11.880
heard about?

00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:13.790
Here is one problem.

00:52:13.790 --> 00:52:14.510
OK.

00:52:14.510 --> 00:52:16.740
Every day, unbeknownst
to you guys,

00:52:16.740 --> 00:52:20.210
there are two to three
dozen huge tractor-trailer

00:52:20.210 --> 00:52:22.620
trucks that start
at dawn from Gilroy

00:52:22.620 --> 00:52:26.010
and bring us our garlic that is
used in all of the dorm dining

00:52:26.010 --> 00:52:26.512
rooms.

00:52:26.512 --> 00:52:27.970
Every single morning,
that happens.

00:52:27.970 --> 00:52:30.730
Thousands of pounds that
are consumed in the dorm.

00:52:30.730 --> 00:52:32.640
And you are trying
to understand where

00:52:32.640 --> 00:52:36.750
in California is the
garlic-generating center,

00:52:36.750 --> 00:52:37.940
the garlic nucleus.

00:52:37.940 --> 00:52:39.620
And what you've been
selectively doing

00:52:39.620 --> 00:52:42.630
is carpet-bombing certain
areas in Northern California.

00:52:42.630 --> 00:52:46.000
And, as a result of
a direct hit on 101,

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:48.550
no more garlic shows up
at Leland Stanford Junior

00:52:48.550 --> 00:52:49.750
University.

00:52:49.750 --> 00:52:51.360
So what have you just concluded?

00:52:51.360 --> 00:52:54.520
101, somewhere right
around Laser Quest,

00:52:54.520 --> 00:52:58.160
is exactly where the center
is for producing garlic

00:52:58.160 --> 00:52:59.670
in Northern California.

00:52:59.670 --> 00:53:02.750
And that's the only plausible
scientific conclusion

00:53:02.750 --> 00:53:03.400
you can reach.

00:53:03.400 --> 00:53:06.870
What we have here is
the problem of centers

00:53:06.870 --> 00:53:09.260
versus fibers of passage.

00:53:09.260 --> 00:53:11.710
Have you just, in
a lesion study,

00:53:11.710 --> 00:53:13.760
found out something
about a region?

00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:15.200
You've destroyed
it, and something

00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:16.960
doesn't work normally.

00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:20.900
Is that because you've taken out
the neurons, the cell bodies,

00:53:20.900 --> 00:53:22.010
in the true center?

00:53:22.010 --> 00:53:26.410
Or have you inadvertently
cut a fiber passage?

00:53:26.410 --> 00:53:28.600
Have you blown out 101--

00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:31.620
And endless mistakes
made over the years.

00:53:31.620 --> 00:53:34.030
Early on in neuroanatomy,
people failing

00:53:34.030 --> 00:53:38.420
to distinguish between
lesions of nuclei

00:53:38.420 --> 00:53:40.170
versus lesions of pathways.

00:53:40.170 --> 00:53:42.970
What really winds
up being hard is

00:53:42.970 --> 00:53:46.910
when you have nuclei with cell
bodies and, at the same time,

00:53:46.910 --> 00:53:49.750
fibers passing through
from someplace else.

00:53:49.750 --> 00:53:52.740
That's what this medial
forebrain bundle is about.

00:53:52.740 --> 00:53:55.090
Cell nuclei all
over the place, but,

00:53:55.090 --> 00:53:57.560
at the same time,
fibers passing through.

00:53:57.560 --> 00:53:59.950
When you do a lesion
in a place like that,

00:53:59.950 --> 00:54:03.260
you can't tell whether it's
the cell bodies, the nucleus

00:54:03.260 --> 00:54:06.120
aspects, the center
that you're taking out,

00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:09.400
or whether you have just
taken out a fiber of passage.

00:54:09.400 --> 00:54:12.720
Enormously difficult
stuff to do.

00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:13.260
OK.

00:54:13.260 --> 00:54:14.610
So that's one constraint.

00:54:14.610 --> 00:54:16.880
Once you get through that,
and you've figured out,

00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:19.550
ooh, this really is the
center-- this really

00:54:19.550 --> 00:54:22.700
is the cell bodies, rather
than just the axons--

00:54:22.700 --> 00:54:24.460
then you deal with
this issue of,

00:54:24.460 --> 00:54:27.160
what does a "center"
mean in the brain?

00:54:27.160 --> 00:54:29.360
Yeah, this may be
the center-- the part

00:54:29.360 --> 00:54:32.280
of the brain that moves this
finger instead of this one.

00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:34.076
That may be a pertinent concept.

00:54:34.076 --> 00:54:38.160
Ooh-- this is the center of
the brain for feeling depressed

00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:43.210
amid a bittersweet gratitude
for the unexpected pleasures

00:54:43.210 --> 00:54:46.250
of life, which are felt
in a poignant context,

00:54:46.250 --> 00:54:49.360
making you smell memories of
the kindergarten classroom

00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:49.990
you were in.

00:54:49.990 --> 00:54:50.490
Oh!

00:54:50.490 --> 00:54:52.980
That's the center of the
limbic system for that.

00:54:52.980 --> 00:54:55.710
By the time you're getting
to a part of the brain that's

00:54:55.710 --> 00:54:58.760
doing all this emotional
stuff, intermixed

00:54:58.760 --> 00:55:02.010
with sensory information,
intermixed with memories,

00:55:02.010 --> 00:55:05.640
even the concept of, oh, this
is the part of the brain that

00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:08.430
does fear for you, this is
the part of the brain that

00:55:08.430 --> 00:55:10.510
does aggression--
as we'll see, these

00:55:10.510 --> 00:55:13.460
are some pretty flimsy concepts.

00:55:13.460 --> 00:55:14.130
OK.

00:55:14.130 --> 00:55:15.580
More qualifiers.

00:55:15.580 --> 00:55:17.480
The next thing you
need to be, in order

00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:20.240
to be a good neuroanatomist
and make use of the information

00:55:20.240 --> 00:55:23.370
from these techniques, is
to also be an ethologist.

00:55:23.370 --> 00:55:25.250
We already heard
a version of that.

00:55:25.250 --> 00:55:27.570
The rhinencephalon--
that's what's

00:55:27.570 --> 00:55:30.700
going on a species that's
all about olfaction.

00:55:30.700 --> 00:55:34.330
You can't understand the wiring
going to the limbic system

00:55:34.330 --> 00:55:37.690
unless you have interviewed
an animal in its own language.

00:55:37.690 --> 00:55:39.760
Classic need for ethology.

00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:42.130
OK, so here would be
another demonstration.

00:55:42.130 --> 00:55:44.480
You have found a part
of the brain which

00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:47.260
you think is interesting.

00:55:47.260 --> 00:55:48.460
It's a limbic structure.

00:55:48.460 --> 00:55:50.180
Nobody quite knows what it does.

00:55:50.180 --> 00:55:53.300
And you have now just stuck
a stimulating electrode down

00:55:53.300 --> 00:55:53.866
in there.

00:55:53.866 --> 00:55:55.240
And the strategy
is, you're going

00:55:55.240 --> 00:55:57.470
to mildly stimulate
there, and you see

00:55:57.470 --> 00:55:59.790
what happens in the organism.

00:55:59.790 --> 00:56:01.910
So your first study
subject is a lion,

00:56:01.910 --> 00:56:04.290
and you've stuck your
stimulating electrode down

00:56:04.290 --> 00:56:04.910
in there.

00:56:04.910 --> 00:56:07.070
And you mildly stimulate
this part of the brain.

00:56:07.070 --> 00:56:11.640
And what the lion
does is it does this.

00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:13.590
It extends its claws.

00:56:13.590 --> 00:56:16.780
Now your next
subject is a human.

00:56:16.780 --> 00:56:19.850
So you sit down, you plunk down
your stimulating electrode,

00:56:19.850 --> 00:56:22.500
and you stimulate mildly in
that same part of the brain.

00:56:22.500 --> 00:56:26.410
And the human says "Shit."

00:56:26.410 --> 00:56:29.897
So what part of the brain
have we just found, here?

00:56:29.897 --> 00:56:31.480
We have found a part
of the brain that

00:56:31.480 --> 00:56:35.600
plays a role in expressing a
certain degree of irritation.

00:56:35.600 --> 00:56:37.460
And if you are a
lion, you're sort

00:56:37.460 --> 00:56:39.110
of extending your claws, there.

00:56:39.110 --> 00:56:41.067
You probably want to
stop messing with me,

00:56:41.067 --> 00:56:42.650
because look what
I'm doing right now,

00:56:42.650 --> 00:56:43.940
and look how sharp they are.

00:56:43.940 --> 00:56:45.640
With the human,
another ver-- you've

00:56:45.640 --> 00:56:47.840
got to know your species.

00:56:47.840 --> 00:56:48.922
Another example of this.

00:56:48.922 --> 00:56:50.630
So here's a part of
the brain, and you're

00:56:50.630 --> 00:56:51.880
wondering what's up with this.

00:56:51.880 --> 00:56:53.040
You do the same strategy.

00:56:53.040 --> 00:56:55.030
You stick in the
stimulating electrodes.

00:56:55.030 --> 00:56:57.280
And you do this to a rat.

00:56:57.280 --> 00:57:00.930
And what she does is proceed to
run around her cage like crazy

00:57:00.930 --> 00:57:03.590
and take pieces of newspaper,
rip into little pieces,

00:57:03.590 --> 00:57:06.000
and stuff them in the corner.

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:08.230
OK, that's an interesting
center of the brain.

00:57:08.230 --> 00:57:11.060
Then you do the exact same
thing to a rhesus monkey.

00:57:11.060 --> 00:57:14.400
And what she does is grab any
sort of cylindrical object

00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:18.010
around and hold it in
her arms, by her nipples.

00:57:18.010 --> 00:57:20.690
Oh-- maternal behavior.

00:57:20.690 --> 00:57:23.330
First case, you got
a rat making a nest.

00:57:23.330 --> 00:57:27.050
Second case, you were
stimulating nursing behavior.

00:57:27.050 --> 00:57:27.750
Ah!

00:57:27.750 --> 00:57:30.250
OK, you've got to
translate it into what

00:57:30.250 --> 00:57:32.070
it looks like in the species.

00:57:32.070 --> 00:57:36.340
And here's one domain where that
went utterly, utterly wrong.

00:57:36.340 --> 00:57:39.780
Part of the hypothalamus
which people used to think

00:57:39.780 --> 00:57:42.530
had everything to
do with aggression.

00:57:42.530 --> 00:57:44.640
Because, for example,
here you would

00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:47.990
take a stimulating
electrode in a rat.

00:57:47.990 --> 00:57:51.940
And you put a mouse in
the same cage as the rat.

00:57:51.940 --> 00:57:54.230
And you stimulate that part
of the brain of the rat.

00:57:54.230 --> 00:57:58.510
And the rat leaps on the mouse,
trying to rip it to shreds.

00:57:58.510 --> 00:58:01.460
Now you take a human,
and you stimulate

00:58:01.460 --> 00:58:02.680
that same part of the brain.

00:58:02.680 --> 00:58:06.680
And they leap up and run over to
the cereal box and rip it open

00:58:06.680 --> 00:58:08.320
and start eating.

00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:10.290
What's up with-- oh!

00:58:10.290 --> 00:58:12.470
Rats eat mice.

00:58:12.470 --> 00:58:15.000
That's what the-- that
was not a rat being angry,

00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:17.940
that was a rat getting
something to snack on.

00:58:17.940 --> 00:58:20.800
And you had to recognize
the difference between what

00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:24.160
does aggression look like
in that species versus what

00:58:24.160 --> 00:58:25.530
does food acquisition.

00:58:25.530 --> 00:58:27.710
And if it's a
predatory species, it

00:58:27.710 --> 00:58:30.750
could pass for looking mighty
aggressive and not actually be.

00:58:30.750 --> 00:58:33.310
A whole generation
of people, thinking

00:58:33.310 --> 00:58:36.470
they were understanding the
neurobiology of aggression,

00:58:36.470 --> 00:58:38.650
inadvertently made this
mistake and wound up

00:58:38.650 --> 00:58:41.430
studying the neurobiology
of predatory behavior.

00:58:41.430 --> 00:58:43.520
So you gotta know your species.

00:58:43.520 --> 00:58:45.180
Ethological principles.

00:58:45.180 --> 00:58:48.510
Next, you've got to
know your individual.

00:58:48.510 --> 00:58:51.070
So here, now you've
got two lions,

00:58:51.070 --> 00:58:53.130
and you stick in your
stimulating electrode

00:58:53.130 --> 00:58:54.150
into the first one.

00:58:54.150 --> 00:58:55.660
That same region, again.

00:58:55.660 --> 00:58:59.010
And you stimulate, and he
does the same deal again.

00:58:59.010 --> 00:59:01.250
Or suppose you even
stimulate it more,

00:59:01.250 --> 00:59:03.030
and he does this
a bunch of times,

00:59:03.030 --> 00:59:05.390
and then he roars savagely.

00:59:05.390 --> 00:59:09.410
Meanwhile, you stimulate the
same area in the second lion

00:59:09.410 --> 00:59:12.160
and nothing happens at all.

00:59:12.160 --> 00:59:13.700
You take two baboons.

00:59:13.700 --> 00:59:15.970
You stimulate that
region in the first one,

00:59:15.970 --> 00:59:19.870
and he gives this big threat
yawn, displaying his canines.

00:59:19.870 --> 00:59:22.140
You stimulate it in
the second individual,

00:59:22.140 --> 00:59:25.400
and nothing changes
in his behavior.

00:59:25.400 --> 00:59:26.412
What's the difference?

00:59:26.412 --> 00:59:27.120
Any speculations?

00:59:30.130 --> 00:59:30.630
Dominance.

00:59:30.630 --> 00:59:31.130
Yes!

00:59:31.130 --> 00:59:31.900
Dominance!

00:59:31.900 --> 00:59:33.980
Here, in the second
case-- in the first case,

00:59:33.980 --> 00:59:35.940
you're doing it to a
dominant individual.

00:59:35.940 --> 00:59:39.420
And they do their
fixed action pattern

00:59:39.420 --> 00:59:42.570
for their species of
expressing aggression,

00:59:42.570 --> 00:59:44.000
dominance, whatever.

00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:46.540
But you do it to
some subordinate guy,

00:59:46.540 --> 00:59:49.800
and that's not part of
his repertoire right now.

00:59:49.800 --> 00:59:53.040
And even though that's the
part of the brain that "does"

00:59:53.040 --> 00:59:56.930
that behavior, it is tightly
inhibited in that individual,

00:59:56.930 --> 00:59:58.430
because that's not
an individual who

00:59:58.430 --> 01:00:00.240
goes around
displaying his canines

01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:01.820
to a whole lot of his buddies.

01:00:01.820 --> 01:00:04.870
You have to know the
individual, as well.

01:00:04.870 --> 01:00:06.850
So, given all of
those constraints,

01:00:06.850 --> 01:00:09.117
that tells you, if you're
going to understand what's

01:00:09.117 --> 01:00:11.200
up with this part of the
brain, and the difference

01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:13.680
between fibers and
nuclei, and don't

01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:16.650
get overly impressed with the
notion of centers of function.

01:00:16.650 --> 01:00:19.240
But you gotta do
the ethology stuff.

01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:21.990
Here, more than any
time that we've seen,

01:00:21.990 --> 01:00:25.130
you gotta understand the
species and the individual

01:00:25.130 --> 01:00:27.660
that you are interviewing
with your electrodes.

01:00:27.660 --> 01:00:28.160
OK.

01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:31.390
So, given all of that, what
do some of the limbic system

01:00:31.390 --> 01:00:32.480
structures do?

01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:35.665
This is a first, insanely
simplifying pass,

01:00:35.665 --> 01:00:37.540
because every one of
these areas you're going

01:00:37.540 --> 01:00:39.440
to hear about oh so much more.

01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:40.670
But a very first pass.

01:00:40.670 --> 01:00:42.690
And you notice, as
part of the first pass

01:00:42.690 --> 01:00:44.780
I'm going to be violating
the caveat that I just

01:00:44.780 --> 01:00:47.350
gave two minutes ago, in that,
on this first pass, here,

01:00:47.350 --> 01:00:49.940
I'm going to be presenting
these as the center.

01:00:49.940 --> 01:00:52.540
This is the part of the
brain that does this.

01:00:52.540 --> 01:00:54.660
We're going to see how
totally wrong that is.

01:00:54.660 --> 01:00:56.490
Nonetheless, on a first pass.

01:00:56.490 --> 01:00:57.870
Amygdala.

01:00:57.870 --> 01:01:02.110
Amygdala is centrally
involved in fear and anxiety.

01:01:02.110 --> 01:01:03.880
You know this already.

01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:06.590
Of tremendous
significance, telling us

01:01:06.590 --> 01:01:10.110
something about why this world
is such a messed up place,

01:01:10.110 --> 01:01:14.660
the amygdala also plays a
central role in aggression.

01:01:14.660 --> 01:01:18.000
Not messed up just because, ooh,
this is the part of the brain

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.800
that generates aggression,
but what it tells you is,

01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:25.340
you cannot understand the
neurobiology of being violent

01:01:25.340 --> 01:01:28.400
without understanding the
neurobiology of being afraid

01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:29.770
and being anxious.

01:01:29.770 --> 01:01:32.170
And the fact that this is
the same part of the brain

01:01:32.170 --> 01:01:34.690
that "does" both
of those functions,

01:01:34.690 --> 01:01:37.850
suggesting on a certain
neurobiological level

01:01:37.850 --> 01:01:40.635
in a world in which no
neurons need be afraid,

01:01:40.635 --> 01:01:42.010
you're not going
to be generating

01:01:42.010 --> 01:01:43.890
a whole lot of aggression.

01:01:43.890 --> 01:01:47.200
Also very interestingly,
what we will hear about

01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:53.320
is, the amygdala also plays a
role in male sexual motivation.

01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:56.060
What's that doing, going
through the amygdala?

01:01:56.060 --> 01:01:58.470
Not sure whatsoever,
but what that

01:01:58.470 --> 01:02:02.590
may begin to explain is the
subset of the individuals who

01:02:02.590 --> 01:02:05.710
will confuse aspects
of aggressive behavior

01:02:05.710 --> 01:02:09.530
and sexual behavior in all
sorts of pathological ways.

01:02:09.530 --> 01:02:12.570
First pass of what
the amygdala is about.

01:02:12.570 --> 01:02:16.920
Meanwhile, next door we've
got-- OK, not "next door,"

01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:19.900
but two synapses away--
we've got the septum.

01:02:19.900 --> 01:02:22.370
Showing a first
important example

01:02:22.370 --> 01:02:24.970
of this theme in
the limbic system,

01:02:24.970 --> 01:02:29.140
amygdala mediates aggression.

01:02:29.140 --> 01:02:31.770
Caveats, all of that, we
got the fine print now.

01:02:31.770 --> 01:02:34.880
The septum inhibits aggression.

01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:37.530
It does exactly the
opposite, beginning

01:02:37.530 --> 01:02:40.220
to present a theme
throughout the limbic system

01:02:40.220 --> 01:02:43.480
of different subareas
working in opposition.

01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:47.980
What would you be logically
betting the farm on right now?

01:02:47.980 --> 01:02:52.320
When the amygdala is activated,
it tries to silence the septum.

01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:56.150
When the septum is activated, it
tries to silence the amygdala.

01:02:56.150 --> 01:02:58.880
Cross-inhibitory projections.

01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:00.710
So what would these
things look like?

01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:03.120
You destroy the
amygdala of an animal,

01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:05.460
you never get aggressive
behavior again.

01:03:05.460 --> 01:03:09.360
You record from it when it's
smelling some scary rival.

01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:11.470
The amygdala activates,
you stimulate,

01:03:11.470 --> 01:03:13.360
and it does an
aggressive behavior.

01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:16.150
You could begin to see
how you figure this out.

01:03:16.150 --> 01:03:18.620
Next, hippocampus.

01:03:18.620 --> 01:03:20.800
Hippocampus, famous
for being involved

01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:22.160
in learning and memory.

01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:25.060
Important for us,
as well, hippocampus

01:03:25.060 --> 01:03:29.870
plays a role in turning
off the stress response.

01:03:29.870 --> 01:03:31.900
You remember that
negative-feedback stuff

01:03:31.900 --> 01:03:33.290
from two days ago.

01:03:33.290 --> 01:03:35.020
Every endocrine
system, there's got

01:03:35.020 --> 01:03:36.790
to be a part of the
brain that measures

01:03:36.790 --> 01:03:39.470
the hormone in the bloodstream
to figure out what should

01:03:39.470 --> 01:03:41.220
the hypothalamus be doing.

01:03:41.220 --> 01:03:45.260
The hippocampus measures the
levels of glucocorticoids.

01:03:45.260 --> 01:03:48.330
Why should a part of the
brain that does memory

01:03:48.330 --> 01:03:50.630
be so intertwined with stress?

01:03:50.630 --> 01:03:52.730
Very logical in two ways.

01:03:52.730 --> 01:03:57.410
Number 1, here's a stressful,
horrifying, scary circumstance.

01:03:57.410 --> 01:04:00.310
Remember what you did to
get out of this, if you

01:04:00.310 --> 01:04:02.010
do manage to get out of this.

01:04:02.010 --> 01:04:05.700
File this away very,
very emphatically.

01:04:05.700 --> 01:04:08.950
Second thing that it's good
for is, stressful circumstance

01:04:08.950 --> 01:04:09.490
coming up.

01:04:09.490 --> 01:04:13.510
What did I do last time to
get out of this circumstance?

01:04:13.510 --> 01:04:16.560
So, an intertwining between
a memory part of the brain

01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:20.680
and a relationship with
stress hormone regulation.

01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:23.030
Next, mammillary bodies.

01:04:23.030 --> 01:04:26.400
Has aspects relevant
to maternal behavior.

01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:29.150
And that's not why it was
called the mammillary bodies,

01:04:29.150 --> 01:04:32.380
but they're shaped by,
like, mammary glands.

01:04:32.380 --> 01:04:34.840
If you, once again, don't
spend a whole lot of time

01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:37.750
or look too much at seahorses,
but the mammillary bodies.

01:04:37.750 --> 01:04:40.250
Next, prefrontal cortex.

01:04:40.250 --> 01:04:41.980
You've heard all
about, and we are

01:04:41.980 --> 01:04:44.370
going to hear tons
more about it,

01:04:44.370 --> 01:04:47.660
because it is incredibly
interesting, in terms

01:04:47.660 --> 01:04:51.820
of maturation and learning
appropriate sexual behavior,

01:04:51.820 --> 01:04:54.470
learning not how
to be aggressive

01:04:54.470 --> 01:04:56.670
but when to be aggressive.

01:04:56.670 --> 01:04:58.760
The notion that
there is a problem

01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:01.600
with this part, the anterior
cingulate, in people

01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:03.270
with clinical depression.

01:05:03.270 --> 01:05:04.530
Anterior cingulate.

01:05:04.530 --> 01:05:06.700
I think I may have
referred to this already.

01:05:06.700 --> 01:05:10.640
Sit somebody down, poke
their finger with a needle,

01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:14.340
and areas here are going to
light up in spinal pathways,

01:05:14.340 --> 01:05:16.020
telling you it was
this finger and not

01:05:16.020 --> 01:05:19.940
that one and areas making you
breathe faster and all of that.

01:05:19.940 --> 01:05:24.500
And, in addition, the anterior
cingulate is going to activate.

01:05:24.500 --> 01:05:28.510
Take somebody now and have
them watch their loved one get

01:05:28.510 --> 01:05:30.310
their finger poked
with a needle,

01:05:30.310 --> 01:05:32.870
and nothing's
happening down here.

01:05:32.870 --> 01:05:35.850
But the anterior
cingulate activates.

01:05:35.850 --> 01:05:40.450
It's doing something
along the lines of empathy

01:05:40.450 --> 01:05:42.900
and feeling somebody
else's pain.

01:05:42.900 --> 01:05:45.420
And suddenly it becomes
real interesting

01:05:45.420 --> 01:05:49.120
that there's stuff going wrong
in it in clinical depression.

01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:51.620
Easily translated
into, that that

01:05:51.620 --> 01:05:56.320
is a disease of pathological
hypersensitivity to the pains

01:05:56.320 --> 01:05:58.460
of life and the world.

01:05:58.460 --> 01:06:00.100
OK, so, frontal cortex.

01:06:00.100 --> 01:06:03.830
Finally, lurking around in
here, the ventral tegmental area

01:06:03.830 --> 01:06:05.520
and the nucleus accumbens.

01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:08.680
Really pertinent to
depression, as well.

01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:10.820
This is the part
of the brain that

01:06:10.820 --> 01:06:14.020
has all the neurons
that release dopamine,

01:06:14.020 --> 01:06:16.500
having to do with pleasure.

01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:19.830
This is the part of the
brain that cocaine works on--

01:06:19.830 --> 01:06:22.870
that, indirectly, all
addictive drugs work on.

01:06:22.870 --> 01:06:26.060
This is the part-- stimulates
dopamine release here,

01:06:26.060 --> 01:06:29.720
stimulates dopamine release at
all the interesting places--

01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:32.950
frontal cortex,
amygdala, hippocampus--

01:06:32.950 --> 01:06:36.000
central to
understanding everything

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:39.490
about appetitive
behavior-- behavior driven

01:06:39.490 --> 01:06:41.630
by an appetite for something.

01:06:41.630 --> 01:06:43.660
That tells us an
elaboration we'll

01:06:43.660 --> 01:06:46.720
be learning about, in terms of
what the dopamine system, here,

01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:47.370
does.

01:06:47.370 --> 01:06:49.500
People used to think
this is the system

01:06:49.500 --> 01:06:53.190
that activates when you
are feeling pleasure.

01:06:53.190 --> 01:06:55.790
Turns out it does something
much more interesting.

01:06:55.790 --> 01:06:58.650
This is the part of the brain
that activates when you're

01:06:58.650 --> 01:07:01.480
anticipating feeling pleasure.

01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:03.630
It's not about
getting the reward.

01:07:03.630 --> 01:07:07.600
It's about anticipating
that you will get a reward.

01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:10.630
And what it's most
about is not only

01:07:10.630 --> 01:07:13.270
anticipating that
you may get a reward

01:07:13.270 --> 01:07:17.560
but powering the behavior
you need to do in order

01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:19.280
to get the reward.

01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:21.820
Standard paradigm
showing this-- you take

01:07:21.820 --> 01:07:23.450
a monkey that's been trained.

01:07:23.450 --> 01:07:26.920
Every time a light comes on,
at that point if it presses

01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:31.710
a lever 10 times, five-second
delay and out comes some food.

01:07:31.710 --> 01:07:33.210
That reward system.

01:07:33.210 --> 01:07:35.370
Initially, the
very first time it

01:07:35.370 --> 01:07:37.860
stumbles into just happening
to hit this out of boredom

01:07:37.860 --> 01:07:39.870
10 times and out
comes some food.

01:07:39.870 --> 01:07:42.790
Ooh, up go dopamine levels
when the food comes out.

01:07:42.790 --> 01:07:45.490
But pretty soon,
what you get instead,

01:07:45.490 --> 01:07:49.670
the dopamine levels go up
when the light first comes on.

01:07:49.670 --> 01:07:52.960
This is not, ooh, I just
got some pleasurable food,

01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:55.255
this is, I know this one.

01:07:55.255 --> 01:07:56.370
I'm on top of this.

01:07:56.370 --> 01:07:57.770
I'm all over this one.

01:07:57.770 --> 01:07:58.710
This one's easy.

01:07:58.710 --> 01:08:00.980
This is one of those
10-lever-press deals.

01:08:00.980 --> 01:08:02.380
This is going to be great.

01:08:02.380 --> 01:08:04.090
I got this under control.

01:08:04.090 --> 01:08:06.480
Elevated dopamine,
you go hit the lever

01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:08.420
and along comes the food.

01:08:08.420 --> 01:08:11.702
Now, instead, you
flash on the signal,

01:08:11.702 --> 01:08:14.160
telling you we're entering one
of those "press the lever 10

01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:15.870
times, you get food" sessions.

01:08:15.870 --> 01:08:19.680
You turn that on, and you
block the rise in dopamine.

01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:22.640
And the animal doesn't
press the lever.

01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:25.859
What this pathway is
about is giving you

01:08:25.859 --> 01:08:29.689
the energy, the motivation,
the depolarization

01:08:29.689 --> 01:08:33.410
of neurons for carrying out
the pursuit of pleasure.

01:08:33.410 --> 01:08:36.890
And that's really
informative, as we'll see.

01:08:36.890 --> 01:08:40.020
Because stimulating
the pursuit of pleasure

01:08:40.020 --> 01:08:42.970
is far more of an addictive
process than the pleasure

01:08:42.970 --> 01:08:46.390
itself, in terms of making
sense of some of the circuitry.

01:08:46.390 --> 01:08:47.020
OK.

01:08:47.020 --> 01:08:50.710
So all of this eventually plunks
us down into the hypothalamus.

01:08:50.710 --> 01:08:53.930
The hypothalamus has
a gazillion subareas,

01:08:53.930 --> 01:08:56.200
all these separate
little nuclei that

01:08:56.200 --> 01:08:59.300
have a variety of
functions, all of which

01:08:59.300 --> 01:09:02.109
have boring, vegetative,
just keeping track

01:09:02.109 --> 01:09:05.359
of body temperature type
functions, all of which

01:09:05.359 --> 01:09:09.430
are also profoundly affected
by the whole world of emotion

01:09:09.430 --> 01:09:10.720
and thought and memory.

01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:11.770
First area.

01:09:11.770 --> 01:09:13.750
Ventromedial hypothalamus.

01:09:13.750 --> 01:09:16.779
We're going to hear tons about
that, starting next week,

01:09:16.779 --> 01:09:20.920
along with a cognate area,
the medial preoptic area.

01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:22.740
These terms will
become familiar.

01:09:22.740 --> 01:09:24.010
Do not freak out.

01:09:24.010 --> 01:09:27.689
These areas are very
pertinent to sexual behavior.

01:09:27.689 --> 01:09:30.939
And what we will see
is that one of them

01:09:30.939 --> 01:09:33.330
is more involved in
male sexual behavior,

01:09:33.330 --> 01:09:37.010
one more in female sexual
behavior, on the average.

01:09:37.010 --> 01:09:40.830
There are gender differences
in the size of these areas.

01:09:40.830 --> 01:09:45.254
There is one landmark study
that everybody learned about,

01:09:45.254 --> 01:09:47.590
about 15 years ago,
showing that there's

01:09:47.590 --> 01:09:50.479
a difference in the size
of one of these regions,

01:09:50.479 --> 01:09:53.130
depending on your
sexual orientation.

01:09:53.130 --> 01:09:55.620
There is an amazing
study that was

01:09:55.620 --> 01:09:58.320
shown that people
who are transgender

01:09:58.320 --> 01:10:01.360
have differences in the size
of some of these regions

01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:05.600
as a function not of what
their sexual phenotype is

01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:08.790
but of what they've always said
"I have always felt like a"

01:10:08.790 --> 01:10:09.610
whatever.

01:10:09.610 --> 01:10:13.380
They have the region the
size of the "what I always

01:10:13.380 --> 01:10:16.310
felt like I was" rather
than what they actually

01:10:16.310 --> 01:10:18.320
are, bringing in
this possibility

01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:21.740
that what transgender is
about is not somebody thinking

01:10:21.740 --> 01:10:24.250
that they have the wrong
sex, but it's somebody

01:10:24.250 --> 01:10:26.040
who's gotten the wrong body.

01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:29.140
So these areas, we're going
to hear lots about next week.

01:10:29.140 --> 01:10:32.760
Next region-- SCN--
suprachiasmatic nucleus.

01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:36.680
And once Julie Andrews says that
as loud and fast as possible.

01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:40.440
The suprachiasmatic nucleus
is about circadian rhythms.

01:10:40.440 --> 01:10:42.560
We're mostly going
to ignore that.

01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:45.170
And anybody who has anything
to do with Craig Heller's lab,

01:10:45.170 --> 01:10:47.540
don't tell him that
I said that, either.

01:10:47.540 --> 01:10:51.405
But it's like-- stupid
circadian rhythms in fish,

01:10:51.405 --> 01:10:53.900
sort of doing two of
my colleagues at once.

01:10:53.900 --> 01:10:55.630
Next-- moving on.

01:10:55.630 --> 01:10:57.340
Another part of
the hypothalamus.

01:10:57.340 --> 01:11:00.440
PVN-- paraventricular nucleus.

01:11:00.440 --> 01:11:02.260
What's made in there?

01:11:02.260 --> 01:11:03.670
CRH.

01:11:03.670 --> 01:11:05.510
That's the part
of the brain that

01:11:05.510 --> 01:11:08.280
initiates the backbone
of the stress response.

01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:11.600
And what areas are
sending projections to it?

01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:12.890
Everything.

01:11:12.890 --> 01:11:16.690
Everything ranging from pathways
that tell you that you've just

01:11:16.690 --> 01:11:19.520
burned your toe, to
pathways telling you

01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:22.410
are very, very hungry,
to pathways telling you

01:11:22.410 --> 01:11:26.580
that you've just smelled a
terrifying territorial rival,

01:11:26.580 --> 01:11:30.400
to pathways telling you you have
just thought about, oh my god,

01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:33.500
only four days till the
midterm, or whatever it is.

01:11:33.500 --> 01:11:35.230
By the time you
get to species that

01:11:35.230 --> 01:11:38.890
can be stressed by very
abstract cognitive states

01:11:38.890 --> 01:11:41.030
by thinking about the
suffering of somebody

01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:43.260
on the other side of
the planet, what do we

01:11:43.260 --> 01:11:44.870
know about the neuroanatomy?

01:11:44.870 --> 01:11:49.280
PVN is getting projections
from all over the place.

01:11:49.280 --> 01:11:51.670
Next, arcuate nucleus.

01:11:51.670 --> 01:11:55.690
Arcuate nucleus is the bottom
of the hypothalamic funnel.

01:11:55.690 --> 01:11:58.940
That's the part where all
of the hypothalamic hormones

01:11:58.940 --> 01:12:02.220
come out and get into the
circulatory system there.

01:12:02.220 --> 01:12:04.100
There's actually another
area on top of that.

01:12:04.100 --> 01:12:06.290
I will not mention it,
but that's its function.

01:12:06.290 --> 01:12:10.340
Lateral hypothalamus has
something to do with hunger.

01:12:10.340 --> 01:12:13.460
And that's the area
that people wasted years

01:12:13.460 --> 01:12:15.370
on thinking they were
studying aggression

01:12:15.370 --> 01:12:18.100
when they were instead
studying predatory behavior.

01:12:18.100 --> 01:12:21.410
Lateral hypothalamus
has to do with hunger.

01:12:21.410 --> 01:12:23.940
Boring version of
it, it does things

01:12:23.940 --> 01:12:26.330
like measure your
blood glucose levels

01:12:26.330 --> 01:12:30.030
and your insulin levels--
all sorts of logical things.

01:12:30.030 --> 01:12:32.520
Really interesting
level, evidence

01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:34.150
that the lateral
hypothalamus has

01:12:34.150 --> 01:12:37.960
something to do with hungers
in the broader sense.

01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:40.690
Hungers for types
of information.

01:12:40.690 --> 01:12:43.500
Hungers for other
rewards other than food.

01:12:43.500 --> 01:12:46.590
It's an area having
to do with hunger.

01:12:46.590 --> 01:12:47.240
OK.

01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:51.070
So this very, very fast
pass here over all of it.

01:12:51.070 --> 01:12:53.380
One additional component
to think about,

01:12:53.380 --> 01:12:54.980
which is, everything
I've just said

01:12:54.980 --> 01:12:59.190
has been oriented around all
this limbic-system stuff, built

01:12:59.190 --> 01:13:02.490
around eventually
influencing the hypothalamus

01:13:02.490 --> 01:13:07.260
and thus eventually influencing
the entire world of hormones

01:13:07.260 --> 01:13:10.010
or of the autonomic
nervous system.

01:13:10.010 --> 01:13:12.300
This is this
unidirectional picture.

01:13:12.300 --> 01:13:15.280
Stuff starts in the
brain, and you have

01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:16.840
outcomes throughout the body.

01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:19.740
What is just as important
is, all the ways

01:13:19.740 --> 01:13:21.920
in which stuff
going on in the body

01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:25.900
will influence limbic function,
completing this circle.

01:13:25.900 --> 01:13:28.380
And an awful lot
of that information

01:13:28.380 --> 01:13:32.530
is the autonomic nervous system
not going in this direction

01:13:32.530 --> 01:13:34.490
but going in this direction.

01:13:34.490 --> 01:13:38.080
Now what this brings
up is a classic theory

01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:40.450
that's been in psychology
since around 1900

01:13:40.450 --> 01:13:44.020
or so called the James-Lange
theory of emotion,

01:13:44.020 --> 01:13:47.920
named for William James and
Lange-- whoever that was.

01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:49.500
That may have been his puppy.

01:13:49.500 --> 01:13:53.830
But the James-Lange theory
of emotion goes as follows.

01:13:53.830 --> 01:13:55.800
Here's how you feel an emotion.

01:13:55.800 --> 01:13:59.610
It is not the case
that your brain decides

01:13:59.610 --> 01:14:03.090
it's feeling an emotion based on
sensory information coming in,

01:14:03.090 --> 01:14:04.200
memory, whatever.

01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:07.920
The brain decides it's feeling
an emotion and tells the body,

01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:10.480
let's speed up the heart,
let's breathe faster,

01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:12.030
let's sweat-- whatever it is.

01:14:12.030 --> 01:14:14.010
That's not how emotion works.

01:14:14.010 --> 01:14:15.480
Here's how emotion works.

01:14:15.480 --> 01:14:19.240
Stimulus comes into your brain,
and before you consciously

01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:23.270
process it your body
is already responding--

01:14:23.270 --> 01:14:25.250
with heart rate,
with blood pressure,

01:14:25.250 --> 01:14:27.700
with pupillary
contractions-- whatever.

01:14:27.700 --> 01:14:30.980
How do you figure out what
emotion you are feeling?

01:14:30.980 --> 01:14:34.190
You are getting information
back from the periphery,

01:14:34.190 --> 01:14:36.730
telling you what's
going on down there.

01:14:36.730 --> 01:14:39.630
In other words, how do you
figure out you're excited?

01:14:39.630 --> 01:14:40.440
Whoa!

01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:42.540
If I'm suddenly
breathing real fast,

01:14:42.540 --> 01:14:44.190
and my heart's
beating fast, it must

01:14:44.190 --> 01:14:47.930
be because I feel ex--
oh, I feel excited now.

01:14:47.930 --> 01:14:49.080
Ridiculous.

01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:52.150
Totally absurd way in which
you could process stuff.

01:14:52.150 --> 01:14:53.530
Completely inefficient.

01:14:53.530 --> 01:14:55.600
And over the years,
after decades

01:14:55.600 --> 01:14:58.800
of being wildly discredited,
more and more evidence

01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:03.180
that that is some of how emotion
is based-- your brain being

01:15:03.180 --> 01:15:06.500
influenced by your bodily
state to decide what

01:15:06.500 --> 01:15:07.900
emotions it's feeling.

01:15:07.900 --> 01:15:10.450
A number of examples.

01:15:10.450 --> 01:15:11.250
First one.

01:15:11.250 --> 01:15:13.840
Ones of those hormones that
just has "emotion" written

01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:15.820
all over it-- adrenaline.

01:15:15.820 --> 01:15:17.680
Adrenaline, epinephrine.

01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:20.010
Epinephrine,
associated with arousal

01:15:20.010 --> 01:15:22.290
of the sympathetic
nervous system.

01:15:22.290 --> 01:15:25.650
So what happens when you
dump some epinephrine

01:15:25.650 --> 01:15:26.870
into the nervous system?

01:15:26.870 --> 01:15:28.250
What does it do to the brain?

01:15:28.250 --> 01:15:29.960
What does it do to
the limbic system?

01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:32.890
What does it do to the sort
of behaviors influenced by it?

01:15:32.890 --> 01:15:35.960
And, greatest demonstration--
this was a classic study

01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:38.490
in the '60s-- guy named
Stanley Schachter doing

01:15:38.490 --> 01:15:41.640
a study that you could
not do again on humans,

01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:42.810
with current rules.

01:15:42.810 --> 01:15:43.820
But here's what he did.

01:15:43.820 --> 01:15:46.430
He gave people
epinephrine, adrenaline,

01:15:46.430 --> 01:15:49.350
without them knowing it.

01:15:49.350 --> 01:15:52.130
OK, less paperwork
in those days.

01:15:52.130 --> 01:15:55.450
But here's what the one version
of the classic experiment was.

01:15:55.450 --> 01:15:57.660
Somebody comes in,
and they believe

01:15:57.660 --> 01:16:01.800
what they're doing is some
study of, you take this vitamin

01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:05.710
and does it change the way
you do Sudoku or something.

01:16:05.710 --> 01:16:07.380
Like, that was just the teaser.

01:16:07.380 --> 01:16:08.710
That was the distracter.

01:16:08.710 --> 01:16:11.940
You've taken this pill
which actually contained

01:16:11.940 --> 01:16:14.280
long-acting epinephrine.

01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:16.350
Then you're going to go
into the study, where

01:16:16.350 --> 01:16:18.670
you're going to get tested
or whatever the task is.

01:16:18.670 --> 01:16:21.170
And please sit down in the
waiting room for a while.

01:16:21.170 --> 01:16:24.780
And the actual experiment took
place in the waiting room.

01:16:24.780 --> 01:16:26.190
Sitting there in
the waiting room

01:16:26.190 --> 01:16:28.650
was another individual,
a confederate

01:16:28.650 --> 01:16:31.140
of Schachter-- somebody
working on the experiment.

01:16:31.140 --> 01:16:33.540
In half the cases,
what the person sitting

01:16:33.540 --> 01:16:36.911
there was supposed to do
was say, I can't believe it!

01:16:36.911 --> 01:16:39.410
I was supposed to go, and they
said I would have a 1 o'clock

01:16:39.410 --> 01:16:40.284
appointment for this.

01:16:40.284 --> 01:16:41.776
It is 1:30 already.

01:16:41.776 --> 01:16:42.900
I'm going to miss my class.

01:16:42.900 --> 01:16:44.108
My car is going to get towed.

01:16:44.108 --> 01:16:45.280
I'm totally pissed off.

01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:47.030
I can't believe these
people are doing it.

01:16:47.030 --> 01:16:49.500
Meanwhile, half the
time the other person

01:16:49.500 --> 01:16:53.160
is sitting there saying, god,
I love these psych studies!

01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:54.160
Do you do a lot of them?

01:16:54.160 --> 01:16:55.170
I love doing these ones!

01:16:55.170 --> 01:16:56.510
I had such a cool one last week.

01:16:56.510 --> 01:16:57.900
Which dorm are you in?

01:16:57.900 --> 01:17:00.490
Let's-- and off it goes.

01:17:00.490 --> 01:17:04.380
The key thing being, totally
different emotional states

01:17:04.380 --> 01:17:06.260
and each case being
exposed to someone

01:17:06.260 --> 01:17:11.100
in a very emotionally aroused,
agitated, expressive state.

01:17:11.100 --> 01:17:12.990
And what did Schachter show?

01:17:12.990 --> 01:17:16.010
Does epinephrine make
you get more angry?

01:17:16.010 --> 01:17:18.660
Does epinephrine make
you get more friendly?

01:17:18.660 --> 01:17:20.000
It doesn't do either.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:21.770
It's modulatory.

01:17:21.770 --> 01:17:24.490
What epinephrine
does is it kicks up

01:17:24.490 --> 01:17:27.140
the fevered level
of whatever emotion

01:17:27.140 --> 01:17:29.410
you are socially
being brought into.

01:17:29.410 --> 01:17:33.250
And thus what you got was the
subject sitting there, soaked

01:17:33.250 --> 01:17:35.620
in epinephrine, while
somebody is, like, going on

01:17:35.620 --> 01:17:38.460
about how late it is, and these
people-- before you know it,

01:17:38.460 --> 01:17:41.830
they're up there, banging on
the counter at the receptionist

01:17:41.830 --> 01:17:44.161
and saying, this is an
outrage, and this is unfair,

01:17:44.161 --> 01:17:45.910
and all of that--
getting caught up in it.

01:17:45.910 --> 01:17:47.860
Meanwhile, the other
one, within, like,

01:17:47.860 --> 01:17:50.012
five minutes, he's
singing frat songs

01:17:50.012 --> 01:17:51.720
with this person
[INAUDIBLE], and they're

01:17:51.720 --> 01:17:52.960
going to get
together for dinner,

01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:54.300
and they're hugging each other.

01:17:54.300 --> 01:17:56.150
And what does epinephrine do?

01:17:56.150 --> 01:18:02.000
It does not cause a behavior,
it exaggerates, it magnifies,

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:05.650
emotional states that have been
provoked for other reasons.

01:18:05.650 --> 01:18:06.650
It modulates.

01:18:06.650 --> 01:18:09.600
The exact same concept
as the other day-- what

01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:12.180
does GABAA do to that neuron A?

01:18:12.180 --> 01:18:13.660
It does nothing whatsoever.

01:18:13.660 --> 01:18:17.380
What GABAA does is it
modulates the ability

01:18:17.380 --> 01:18:19.720
of this glutamatergic
neuron to talk to A.

01:18:19.720 --> 01:18:21.160
What does epinephrine do?

01:18:21.160 --> 01:18:23.210
Does it create any emotions?

01:18:23.210 --> 01:18:24.210
Not at all.

01:18:24.210 --> 01:18:28.070
What it does is jack up the
intensity of whatever emotions

01:18:28.070 --> 01:18:31.210
your social circumstances
have generated.

01:18:31.210 --> 01:18:34.610
Another example of
James-Lange sort of stuff.

01:18:34.610 --> 01:18:35.260
OK.

01:18:35.260 --> 01:18:38.030
So you were sitting around,
and you were terribly anxious,

01:18:38.030 --> 01:18:39.620
and you go to a clinician.

01:18:39.620 --> 01:18:42.900
And the person decides to
give you-- what class of drugs

01:18:42.900 --> 01:18:44.350
do we know endlessly by now?

01:18:44.350 --> 01:18:45.830
Benzodiazepines.

01:18:45.830 --> 01:18:49.060
They give you some Valium
to decrease your anxiety.

01:18:49.060 --> 01:18:51.720
Meanwhile, across
town, there's somebody

01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:55.120
who has a big gymnastics
competition on Sunday--

01:18:55.120 --> 01:18:55.910
whatever.

01:18:55.910 --> 01:18:57.140
And they've pulled a muscle.

01:18:57.140 --> 01:18:58.690
They've been having
muscle spasms,

01:18:58.690 --> 01:19:00.540
and this is really a problem.

01:19:00.540 --> 01:19:02.100
So they go to their
clinician, who

01:19:02.100 --> 01:19:06.320
gives them a muscle
relaxant-- Benzodiazepines--

01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:08.080
the exact same dose.

01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:08.940
So, wait a second.

01:19:08.940 --> 01:19:11.860
Here's somebody taking
Valium for anxiety,

01:19:11.860 --> 01:19:15.460
and here's somebody taking
Valium to relax their muscles.

01:19:15.460 --> 01:19:16.840
What's up with that?

01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:18.890
It's the exact same thing.

01:19:18.890 --> 01:19:21.660
And it is a very
James-Lange moment.

01:19:21.660 --> 01:19:24.220
What's part of anxiety about?

01:19:24.220 --> 01:19:28.020
It's monitoring the level
of tension in your body.

01:19:28.020 --> 01:19:30.780
It's getting feedback
from muscle tone.

01:19:30.780 --> 01:19:34.460
And that's one of the ways
in which antianxiety drugs

01:19:34.460 --> 01:19:36.090
like benzodiazepines work.

01:19:36.090 --> 01:19:39.590
Because you're sitting there,
and you're saying things

01:19:39.590 --> 01:19:42.070
are just as horrible as
they were an hour ago!

01:19:42.070 --> 01:19:43.660
But I am so relaxed.

01:19:43.660 --> 01:19:45.690
I'm, like, dripping out
of this chair, here.

01:19:45.690 --> 01:19:48.170
It must not be so bad.

01:19:48.170 --> 01:19:51.860
Part of you deciding is
monitoring the muscle tone

01:19:51.860 --> 01:19:55.860
in your body, coming back
with autonomic information.

01:19:55.860 --> 01:19:57.560
That's where you
break the cycle.

01:19:57.560 --> 01:20:00.510
That's why the same
drug decreases anxiety

01:20:00.510 --> 01:20:02.880
and is a muscle relaxant.

01:20:02.880 --> 01:20:04.560
More examples of this.

01:20:04.560 --> 01:20:07.840
One is, what's going
on with meditation?

01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:10.696
That's what
biofeedback taps into.

01:20:10.696 --> 01:20:12.570
So you're sitting there,
and you're suffering

01:20:12.570 --> 01:20:14.050
from high blood pressure.

01:20:14.050 --> 01:20:17.190
Translated into our
terms, something here

01:20:17.190 --> 01:20:20.280
is driving blood pressure
to be increased too much.

01:20:20.280 --> 01:20:21.390
It's not necessarily that.

01:20:21.390 --> 01:20:22.810
It could also be blood vessels.

01:20:22.810 --> 01:20:25.730
But we'll put it on a brain
basis, here, for the moment.

01:20:25.730 --> 01:20:29.170
So you've got a choice
between taking drugs or doing

01:20:29.170 --> 01:20:30.760
some meditational
something that you

01:20:30.760 --> 01:20:34.360
want to hook up to biofeedback,
to make it more effective.

01:20:34.360 --> 01:20:35.330
Here's what you do.

01:20:35.330 --> 01:20:38.220
They sit you down,
and they wire you

01:20:38.220 --> 01:20:40.350
up so that they can monitor
your blood pressure.

01:20:40.350 --> 01:20:41.170
And you sit there.

01:20:41.170 --> 01:20:45.490
And they say, OK, I want you
to relax and focus, and focus

01:20:45.490 --> 01:20:48.752
on the best day of your life.

01:20:48.752 --> 01:20:50.460
Let's see what happens
to blood pressure.

01:20:50.460 --> 01:20:51.140
Nothing much.

01:20:51.140 --> 01:20:54.140
OK, focus on your
favorite piece of music.

01:20:54.140 --> 01:20:54.720
Nothing much.

01:20:54.720 --> 01:20:57.290
OK, focus on your favorite
piece of music that's

01:20:57.290 --> 01:20:59.330
kind of slow and dreamy--

01:20:59.330 --> 01:21:01.370
And suddenly the
monitor goes this way.

01:21:01.370 --> 01:21:04.400
The person's blood pressure
has just dropped 10 points.

01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:06.570
And then you say,
stop, wait a second--

01:21:06.570 --> 01:21:08.570
what did you just think about?

01:21:08.570 --> 01:21:10.100
Think about it again.

01:21:10.100 --> 01:21:11.590
And it does it again.

01:21:11.590 --> 01:21:14.120
And what the person begins
to learn at this point

01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:17.650
is, what aspects of
meditative states,

01:21:17.650 --> 01:21:19.770
what aspects of
memory-- whatever--

01:21:19.770 --> 01:21:24.690
suddenly allow the brain to
be regulating blood pressure.

01:21:24.690 --> 01:21:26.410
What's going on there?

01:21:26.410 --> 01:21:30.130
You're using this machine
to send the signal up there.

01:21:30.130 --> 01:21:33.020
Part of what's also going
on is feedback that way.

01:21:33.020 --> 01:21:35.810
So, another version
of one of these loops.

01:21:35.810 --> 01:21:37.390
More versions of loops.

01:21:37.390 --> 01:21:39.240
Here's one that
probably accounts

01:21:39.240 --> 01:21:42.510
for 90% of the arguments
between significant others

01:21:42.510 --> 01:21:43.700
on this planet.

01:21:43.700 --> 01:21:44.300
OK.

01:21:44.300 --> 01:21:46.110
So you and your
significant other

01:21:46.110 --> 01:21:51.100
are behaving, interacting in a
primate social biological way.

01:21:51.100 --> 01:21:53.020
And one of you
does something that

01:21:53.020 --> 01:21:55.470
totally outrages the other one.

01:21:55.470 --> 01:21:58.890
And they're furious at
you-- he says, personifying.

01:21:58.890 --> 01:22:00.576
And they're furious.

01:22:00.576 --> 01:22:03.770
And what's going on-- and
they convince you readily

01:22:03.770 --> 01:22:05.340
that you're at
fault and, in fact,

01:22:05.340 --> 01:22:07.040
this was a horrible
thing you did.

01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:08.860
And they're all agitated.

01:22:08.860 --> 01:22:11.700
And you apologize, and you make
it sound like you really mean

01:22:11.700 --> 01:22:13.280
it, because you really mean it.

01:22:13.280 --> 01:22:14.810
And you apologize, and great.

01:22:14.810 --> 01:22:17.690
And they finally say OK,
OK, I accept your apology.

01:22:17.690 --> 01:22:18.940
Don't do it again.

01:22:18.940 --> 01:22:20.100
It's all sorted out.

01:22:20.100 --> 01:22:20.880
It's over with.

01:22:20.880 --> 01:22:21.810
It's done.

01:22:21.810 --> 01:22:24.027
And then you begin
to think, OK great,

01:22:24.027 --> 01:22:25.860
we're out the other end
of the woods, there.

01:22:25.860 --> 01:22:27.100
Things are just fine now.

01:22:27.100 --> 01:22:27.600
Things are--

01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:31.330
And suddenly they remember
something miserable

01:22:31.330 --> 01:22:33.950
you did to them in 1968!

01:22:33.950 --> 01:22:36.940
And they suddenly remembered
in every possible detail

01:22:36.940 --> 01:22:39.680
and want to argue about
it all over again!

01:22:39.680 --> 01:22:41.580
What's going on there?

01:22:41.580 --> 01:22:45.080
What we have is another
James-Lange moment,

01:22:45.080 --> 01:22:48.840
when you get into
aroused, angry state,

01:22:48.840 --> 01:22:51.160
and then it's all
over with, afterward.

01:22:51.160 --> 01:22:54.010
That's great, because the
person has apologized.

01:22:54.010 --> 01:22:56.120
So, cognitively, you
have just adjusted

01:22:56.120 --> 01:22:59.720
things-- yes, they recognize
they did the wrong thing.

01:22:59.720 --> 01:23:01.970
Good, I'm vindicated,
that's great.

01:23:01.970 --> 01:23:02.830
It's settled now.

01:23:02.830 --> 01:23:03.780
It's perfect.

01:23:03.780 --> 01:23:05.910
And you could do
that in a second.

01:23:05.910 --> 01:23:08.350
The trouble is, it
takes a long time.

01:23:08.350 --> 01:23:11.860
It takes minutes, now, for
your sympathetic nervous system

01:23:11.860 --> 01:23:15.140
and its consequences to
completely coast back

01:23:15.140 --> 01:23:16.330
to baseline.

01:23:16.330 --> 01:23:19.180
So you're sitting there, and
the problem has been solved,

01:23:19.180 --> 01:23:21.210
but your heart is still racing.

01:23:21.210 --> 01:23:22.450
And what do you have?

01:23:22.450 --> 01:23:25.470
A James-Lange moment, there,
sitting there, saying,

01:23:25.470 --> 01:23:28.350
OK, well, I was really
upset about that.

01:23:28.350 --> 01:23:30.880
But that's just sorted out,
and that's all taken care of.

01:23:30.880 --> 01:23:34.180
Except I'm still feeling
totally agitated!

01:23:34.180 --> 01:23:35.750
It must be for some reason.

01:23:35.750 --> 01:23:36.400
Oh!

01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:39.080
It's what that person did to
me in the second Roosevelt

01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:39.850
administration!

01:23:39.850 --> 01:23:41.730
And suddenly out it comes out.

01:23:41.730 --> 01:23:44.070
It's this James-Lange
loop, there,

01:23:44.070 --> 01:23:48.200
of the physiological
information coming back there,

01:23:48.200 --> 01:23:51.210
prompting one into
trying to find

01:23:51.210 --> 01:23:53.530
a cognitive explanation for it.

01:23:53.530 --> 01:23:58.460
There must be a reason why I
am still hyperventi-- oh, this

01:23:58.460 --> 01:23:59.710
must be the reason.

01:23:59.710 --> 01:24:01.850
This thing we need
to go over, also.

01:24:01.850 --> 01:24:02.350
OK.

01:24:02.350 --> 01:24:04.800
I am going to give
you one factoid, here,

01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:06.720
and you can do with
it what you will.

01:24:06.720 --> 01:24:10.300
But there is a pronounced
gender difference in how long

01:24:10.300 --> 01:24:13.720
it takes after strong
sympathetic arousal for things

01:24:13.720 --> 01:24:15.540
to go back to baseline.

01:24:15.540 --> 01:24:16.360
[LAUGHTER]

01:24:16.360 --> 01:24:18.370
OK, let's just get a
show of hands, here.

01:24:18.370 --> 01:24:19.900
[LAUGHTER]

01:24:19.900 --> 01:24:22.390
Who guesses that it
takes longer to get back

01:24:22.390 --> 01:24:25.968
to baseline in males?

01:24:25.968 --> 01:24:27.760
[LAUGHTER]

01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:31.120
OK, well, unless there's a
lot of abstainers here I think

01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:32.832
we're-- OK, females?

01:24:32.832 --> 01:24:33.650
Yeah.

01:24:33.650 --> 01:24:34.420
Yes!

01:24:34.420 --> 01:24:37.520
There is a pronounced
gender difference in that.

01:24:37.520 --> 01:24:39.250
And there's another
realm in which

01:24:39.250 --> 01:24:41.540
you have that same pronounced
gender difference, which

01:24:41.540 --> 01:24:43.540
is after orgasm.

01:24:43.540 --> 01:24:48.400
Males go back to baseline a
lot faster than females do.

01:24:48.400 --> 01:24:51.325
And that explains a whole
world of, like, you know,

01:24:51.325 --> 01:24:54.940
he wants to go out and get
noodles in peanut sauce,

01:24:54.940 --> 01:24:57.659
and she wants to
cuddle and talk to him

01:24:57.659 --> 01:24:58.825
and all that sort of thing--

01:24:58.825 --> 01:24:59.325
[LAUGHTER]

01:24:59.325 --> 01:25:00.740
--and [INAUDIBLE].

01:25:00.740 --> 01:25:05.320
And it's James-Lange's damn
fault that that sort of thing

01:25:05.320 --> 01:25:05.820
goes on.

01:25:05.820 --> 01:25:06.320
OK.

01:25:06.320 --> 01:25:08.060
So we, there, have
another example

01:25:08.060 --> 01:25:09.830
of these feedback loops.

01:25:09.830 --> 01:25:11.040
A couple more.

01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:13.070
Here's an amazing thing.

01:25:13.070 --> 01:25:15.860
You take somebody with
clinical depression,

01:25:15.860 --> 01:25:18.020
and you force
them, mechanically,

01:25:18.020 --> 01:25:22.220
to take a somatic state that
mediates different emotions

01:25:22.220 --> 01:25:23.620
and signifies other emotions.

01:25:23.620 --> 01:25:24.920
What am I talking about?

01:25:24.920 --> 01:25:26.580
You take the person
with depression,

01:25:26.580 --> 01:25:29.400
and you say, you are
going to mechanically go

01:25:29.400 --> 01:25:31.370
through the process,
with your facial muscles,

01:25:31.370 --> 01:25:33.960
of smiling-- again
and again and again.

01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:36.610
And you force somebody to do
that for a half hour or so,

01:25:36.610 --> 01:25:37.520
intermittently.

01:25:37.520 --> 01:25:39.810
And they feel better afterward.

01:25:39.810 --> 01:25:43.800
The world is just as depressing
as it was 30 minutes before,

01:25:43.800 --> 01:25:46.170
but there's something
going on here, saying,

01:25:46.170 --> 01:25:48.350
if I am getting
feedback saying I'm

01:25:48.350 --> 01:25:49.990
doing this thing with
my muscles, here,

01:25:49.990 --> 01:25:53.550
and I'm doing it a lot,
it must not be so bad.

01:25:53.550 --> 01:25:55.980
Other studies showing
you take somebody

01:25:55.980 --> 01:25:58.530
and either they are
slumped in a chair

01:25:58.530 --> 01:26:00.220
or you have them
sitting up erect,

01:26:00.220 --> 01:26:03.060
and you tell them the score
that they got on a test

01:26:03.060 --> 01:26:04.690
that you just gave
them before that,

01:26:04.690 --> 01:26:06.410
and it's a very good score.

01:26:06.410 --> 01:26:09.390
And what you see is, the more
straight upright the person is

01:26:09.390 --> 01:26:11.570
sitting, afterward,
the more they

01:26:11.570 --> 01:26:13.870
will assess themselves
as being made happy

01:26:13.870 --> 01:26:17.890
by the result they got, and
being made to feel proud.

01:26:17.890 --> 01:26:19.140
What's up with that?

01:26:19.140 --> 01:26:22.490
The posture of your spine
is doing something up here.

01:26:22.490 --> 01:26:26.230
What this shows us is, amid
this whole orientation--

01:26:26.230 --> 01:26:29.860
the brain controlling hormones,
the brain controlling spinal,

01:26:29.860 --> 01:26:32.130
autonomic stuff, the
limbic system telling--

01:26:32.130 --> 01:26:36.420
all of this outflow from there,
completing this big circle back

01:26:36.420 --> 01:26:38.320
to the very first class--

01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:41.890
That business of, think about
something really emotionally

01:26:41.890 --> 01:26:44.690
laden, and suddenly your
body works differently.

01:26:44.690 --> 01:26:47.200
Think about the people
who have committed murders

01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:51.340
in the context of a brain
tumor, a period, their hormone

01:26:51.340 --> 01:26:54.640
levels, their nutritional
history, here.

01:26:54.640 --> 01:26:57.990
Junk-food murders and all
of that-- Twinkie defenses.

01:26:57.990 --> 01:27:01.410
What that is, is the
other half of this loop.

01:27:01.410 --> 01:27:02.120
OK.

01:27:02.120 --> 01:27:06.280
So now you should sit straight
up and be proud of yourself,

01:27:06.280 --> 01:27:08.060
because you now have
all of the buckets

01:27:08.060 --> 01:27:10.010
necessary under
your belt. So that's

01:27:10.010 --> 01:27:11.400
the first piece of good news.

01:27:11.400 --> 01:27:14.090
And that now transitions
us to the latter half

01:27:14.090 --> 01:27:17.820
of the course, which will now be
to use all of these approaches

01:27:17.820 --> 01:27:20.000
in looking at
specific behaviors.

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:23.190
Here is a sexual
behavior, first off.

01:27:23.190 --> 01:27:25.320
As a good ethologist,
do we actually

01:27:25.320 --> 01:27:28.270
understand what we've just
observed for this species,

01:27:28.270 --> 01:27:29.790
this individual, et cetera?

01:27:29.790 --> 01:27:32.290
What went on in the
brain one second

01:27:32.290 --> 01:27:34.910
before that caused
that behavior to occur?

01:27:34.910 --> 01:27:36.980
What's up with the neurobiology?

01:27:36.980 --> 01:27:40.820
What sensory stimuli caused
those neurons to generate--

01:27:40.820 --> 01:27:43.980
The world of ethological
releasing stimuli.

01:27:43.980 --> 01:27:46.070
What hormones in
the bloodstream,

01:27:46.070 --> 01:27:48.530
in the last minute,
in the last hour,

01:27:48.530 --> 01:27:50.710
made the individual
more or less sensitive

01:27:50.710 --> 01:27:53.360
to that sensory information,
blah blah-- all the way

01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:56.570
back to understanding
the evolutionary legacy

01:27:56.570 --> 01:27:59.532
of the species of which
this individual is a member.

01:27:59.532 --> 01:28:01.740
That's going to be our
strategy in each one of these,

01:28:01.740 --> 01:28:03.950
now, working our
way back in time.

01:28:03.950 --> 01:28:07.430
So there's that great news that
you are in that position now

01:28:07.430 --> 01:28:08.180
to take it on.

01:28:08.180 --> 01:28:10.250
The other piece of
good news is, we're not

01:28:10.250 --> 01:28:11.300
going to do it on Monday.

01:28:11.300 --> 01:28:12.590
We won't have class on Monday.

01:28:12.590 --> 01:28:14.660
So you can all get
all James-Langey

01:28:14.660 --> 01:28:17.030
and freaked out for
the exam Monday night.

01:28:17.030 --> 01:28:18.955
But quick survey among the TAs.

01:28:18.955 --> 01:28:20.630
So, what do you guys think?

01:28:20.630 --> 01:28:23.150
Should we have a
review session then?

01:28:23.150 --> 01:28:25.622
Should we show a David
Attenborough movie?

01:28:25.622 --> 01:28:26.919
Show the Attenborough.

01:28:26.919 --> 01:28:27.460
Attenborough.

01:28:27.460 --> 01:28:28.800
OK, David Attenborough.

01:28:28.800 --> 01:28:30.950
So which one are you
going to bring in?

01:28:30.950 --> 01:28:33.330
We'll watch Life,
the BBC version,

01:28:33.330 --> 01:28:34.330
with David Attenborough.

01:28:34.330 --> 01:28:36.635
I don't think it's really
available in the US

01:28:36.635 --> 01:28:39.410
very much yet, so it's
kind of a cool oppor--

01:28:39.410 --> 01:28:42.660
