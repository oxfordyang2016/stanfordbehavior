00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.940
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:07.959
Stanford University.

00:00:07.959 --> 00:00:09.000
Where have we got to now?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.330
You guys have all
the basics in hand

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:16.280
now for our next two buckets--
neurobiology and endocrinology.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.940
What you have now, I hope, is
a sense of especially the neuro

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.790
as the final common
funnel out of which

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.320
comes all that behavior
stuff we've been thinking

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.750
about-- genes-- whether they
are changing in a static

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.580
and then punctuated way
or a gradualist way.

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.760
What they code for we
now know are proteins.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.340
And in the realm of behavior,
what that's all about,

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.420
you now know, are enzymes that
make neurotransmitters, enzymes

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.660
that break them apart, receptors
for neurotransmitters, the ion

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.650
channels that allow all
the excitability stuff--

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.800
all of that should be a
way of conceptualizing

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.980
what all that gene stuff that
we've had so far funnels into.

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.040
Likewise with the
endocrinology-- all those ways

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.820
in which reproductive
status is going

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.770
to change how the
brain works, all

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.650
of those great evolutionary
models, blah, blah.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.990
That's now endocrinology.

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.140
That's now the
ability of hormones

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.000
to affect the nervous system.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.650
And what came
through, hopefully,

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.380
over and over for all of you in
the lectures over the last week

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.280
are two themes-- lots
of different ways

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.150
by which the nervous system
and the endocrine system

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.470
can change its
function over time.

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.890
And number two, lots
of different realms

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.710
where there will be
individual differences--

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.370
all the ways in
which you will have

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.217
a brain and a bunch
of glands that

00:01:40.217 --> 00:01:42.300
are different than the
person sitting next to you.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.260
And what you should be able
to piece apart readily by now

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.980
is where some of those
individual differences

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.650
are coming from in the
form of genetic influences,

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.380
where some of them are coming
from environmental ones,

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.970
to begin to take some
of those if/then clauses

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.770
back in the genetics lectures--
if it smells like a relative,

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.000
then cooperate with them--
to begin to imagine now

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.889
how the nervous system,
how hormones would actually

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:12.460
translate that stuff
into this next bucket.

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.560
So this will be our last bucket.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.294
Today we'll be looking
at all the ways

00:02:16.294 --> 00:02:18.210
in which everything you
heard in the last week

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:19.890
is vastly more complicated.

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.900
And on Friday what
we will do is focus

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.160
in on the part of the
nervous system that

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.280
is most pertinent to
rest of the course.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.680
Should you ever
happen by some chance

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.650
to stumble into medical school
somewhere down the line, when

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.720
they get around to the
nervous system there,

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.320
you are going to hear about
the spinal cord endlessly.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.670
You're going to hear
about the cerebellum.

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.050
You're going to hear
about parts of the cortex.

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:43.660
You are going to
hear next to nothing

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.190
about the part we'll be
talking to on Friday.

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.640
And what it's about is
emotion, and behavior,

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.130
and affect-- a part of the
brain called the limbic system.

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.510
In medical school, they
will pound into your head

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.420
over and over and over
how the spinal cord moves

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.710
different motor systems.

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:03.470
Because that's 99%
of what neurology

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.090
can concern itself with.

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.710
Because it at least has a
fighting chance of doing

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.570
something therapeutic there.

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.010
This is the part
of the brain that

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.840
is most defining to who we
are-- personality, temperament,

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:16.590
all of that.

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.620
And it will be central
to making sense

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.760
of all of this stuff coming in
the second half of the course.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.780
So it's going to be a
very different domain

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.680
of the nervous system.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.920
So what today is about
is taking everything

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.580
you've learned
over the last week,

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.520
and discovering that the ways
in which it is tragically

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.320
distortive and not quite right,
and comes with all of these

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.800
but wait-a-seconds and
qualifiers, and all

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.090
the ways in which this first
pass you had in the last week

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.290
sets you up now for
appreciating an enormously more

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.630
complicated system than
you've already seen,

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:53.730
one which generates, thus,
vastly more possibilities

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.850
of communication, of
information contained

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.820
within these neural
pathways, one which generates

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:04.150
vastly more possibilities
of individual differences

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.760
and of experience
leaving its imprint,

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.360
one that generates vastly
more possibilities for things

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.360
to go really wrong in the
realms of abnormal behavior.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.320
OK so a lot of
what we'll be doing

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.680
is taking what you
got in the last week

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.230
and seeing where, in fact,
current research shows that it

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:24.170
is much, much more complicated.

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:27.650
OK, first version--
one of the rules that

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.260
runs through all
of neurobiology--

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.400
you start learning the
field and at some point,

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.580
they pull out the
name of this guy Dale.

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.790
Dale who was the law giver.

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:39.200
Dale was some
neurobiologist early

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.380
in the 20th century
who generated two laws

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.600
that every single
child was forced

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.930
to learn throughout
the 1920s and 1930s

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:48.670
about how the nervous
system worked.

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:51.440
Some time later than
that, Dale's two laws--

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.440
and we will start
off with one of them.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.470
And it makes perfect sense
until you see that, in fact, it

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.310
has no basis in reality.

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.572
Here is Dale's first law,
which was you got your neuron--

00:05:02.572 --> 00:05:04.280
and you should know
by now we are dealing

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.090
with our schematic neuron.

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.390
And once we get into
circuits in more detail,

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:11.570
we will give up the diamond
shape on the neuron cell bodies

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:13.230
and switch over to
circles, showing

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:14.780
just how fast evolution can be.

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.580
But we've got the neuron here.

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.820
And what we've got are the
axon and the axon terminals.

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.556
And what Dale's law number
two-- and of course, it's

00:05:23.556 --> 00:05:25.930
irritating that we're doing
number two before number one,

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:29.660
but tough-- what you've got
here with Dale's law number

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:34.380
two is, each neuron has
one characteristic type

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:38.000
of neurotransmitter--
one and only one.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.520
And that's what it's releasing
from all of its axon terminals.

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.340
And thus, you could
categorize any given neuron

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.860
as this is one that
releases serotonin.

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.940
This one is one that releases
dopamine, et cetera, et cetera.

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.400
Notice that's a
world of difference

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.200
as to what types of
neurotransmitters

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.140
it has receptors for.

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:59.680
That's something else entirely.

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.630
That's what neurons over
there it's listening to.

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:05.920
But any given neuron is
releasing only one kind

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:07.730
of neurotransmitter.

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:10.010
So that one went down
the tube during the '80s

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:11.810
with the discovery,
in fact, that there

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:15.650
are multiple neurotransmitters
released by neurons.

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:19.000
And this was boggling to
people, and forced people

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.520
to give up on Dale number two.

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:25.340
And initially, this just seems
like pointless complication.

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:27.150
What you wind up
seeing is it puts

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:30.100
a lot more potential
for information

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:31.380
into the whole business here.

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:34.860
OK, so here we have our
archetypal synapse here,

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:36.670
going from left to
right as always.

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:39.770
And we've got the one on the
left here with its vesicles--

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:42.700
those little water balloons
filled with neurotransmitter.

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:44.720
Along comes the
action potential.

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.200
As a result, the vesicle
moves to the cell membrane,

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:51.670
merges with it, dumps the
neurotransmitter into there.

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:55.870
As you might guess, that
actual process of exocytosis,

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:59.160
dumping the neurotransmitter,
is vastly more complicated.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:00.760
But this is our general model.

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:05.250
And what people began to realize
was that all sorts of neurons,

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:07.880
all sorts of neurotransmitter
types, in fact,

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:11.880
came with two different
colors of neurotransmitters

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:14.770
in the vesicles-- came
with two different kinds.

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:19.400
Notice this is different
from in this axon terminal

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.880
you release this type
of neurotransmitter.

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:23.920
And in this one, you
release that type.

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:26.780
No, every single
axon terminal would

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:29.800
contain both of these
types of neurotransmitters.

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:33.090
And notice also, it
would not be one vesicle

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:36.310
was a blue neurotransmitter
vesicle and one was a red.

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:39.970
Each one of them had a
mixture of the two types.

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:42.600
What has been found
is that occurs in lots

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:43.870
of different types of neurons.

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:46.190
I believe the record
is that there are now

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:48.760
some vesicles that contain
three different types

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:50.320
of neurotransmitters.

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:53.240
So what we've got here
are two different classes

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:54.690
of messengers coming out.

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:57.080
And what you should be
able to immediately imagine

00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:59.900
is, that's going to
produce a lot more

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:02.020
potential for information.

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:03.870
Two different types
of messengers-- one

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:06.970
of the characteristics that
tends to be the pattern

00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:09.780
is that when you get
two neurotransmitters

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:12.750
in the same neuron,
the same axon

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:14.470
terminal and the
same vesicle, they

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:18.460
tend to be structurally very
different sorts of classes

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:19.940
of neurotransmitters.

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:24.150
One might be a type made from
a simple single amino acid.

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:26.880
Another one is somewhat
of a complicated protein.

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:29.560
They tend to have fairly
different structures.

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:31.590
And what that
often tells you is,

00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:34.559
they're going to have
different mechanisms of action.

00:08:34.559 --> 00:08:36.679
They're going to have
different speeds of action.

00:08:36.679 --> 00:08:39.200
What you wind up seeing
is very often, when

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:41.450
two different types
of neurotransmitters

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:44.120
are contained in the
neuron, one of them

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:46.820
works much more
rapidly than the other.

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:51.000
One has a rapid, short-term
effect-- quickly decrementing.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.250
The other will have
a longer effect.

00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:55.410
And by now, you can
begin to imagine

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:57.460
what counts as a longer effect.

00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:01.150
You change gene
transcription in that neuron.

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:03.540
You change structural
stuff happening,

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:05.920
as opposed to the short
one, where just suddenly

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:09.260
some little ionic
excitability change occurs

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:10.750
in a couple of milliseconds.

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:15.450
You begin to see this pattern of
two different ways of coding--

00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:18.240
coding for different
types of information.

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:22.490
What we'll see shortly is one
of the truly bizarre things that

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:26.730
pops up a lot with these cases
of multiple neurotransmitters.

00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:32.060
One of them will have receptors
for it on the neuron itself.

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:33.540
And we will focus
on that shortly.

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:36.740
That actually winds up making
a fair amount of sense.

00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:39.760
OK, so Dale trashed
in terms of the notion

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:42.740
of any given neuron having
only one neurotransmitter.

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:45.810
In some types of neurons
you have, instead, pairs,

00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:47.900
but following the
same sort of rules.

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:50.510
And thanks to the typical
structural difference

00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:52.420
between the pairs of
neurotransmitters,

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:55.450
you tend to get different
sorts of functions.

00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:58.780
You see a similar principle
over at the endocrine end

00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:03.310
of things-- a world of more than
one single messenger carrying

00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:06.420
the same message, or the
same source of information

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:08.060
carrying multiple messengers.

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:11.970
Where we see here is what by
now should be familiar as well,

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:13.760
here where you got
your pituitary,

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:15.940
and you got your
anterior pituitary,

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:17.540
which is always facing left.

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:22.110
And the anterior here, we have
the glandular cells releasing,

00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:24.770
as you saw the other day, ACTH.

00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:26.300
Lots of this lecture
is going to be

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:29.240
about the regulation of the
adrenal cortical system--

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:31.140
the glucocorticoid
system-- because it's

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:32.510
the best hormone on Earth.

00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:33.740
And I'm willing to prove it.

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:36.040
But what we have here
is ACTH coming out.

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:38.570
And you remember what you
had the other day, which

00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:40.920
is incorrectly named.

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:42.810
You've got CRH.

00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:47.140
That's that business about the
brain as an endocrine gland,

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:50.480
the brain releasing hormones
into this little portal

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:51.920
circulatory system.

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:55.000
And out comes its characteristic
pituitary hormone.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.790
So what you saw the
other day is CRH

00:10:57.790 --> 00:11:01.790
is the hormone, the
hypothalamic hormone

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:03.620
at the base of the
brain here that's

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:06.540
released into this local
circulatory system, which

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:09.530
stimulates these
cells to dump ACTH

00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:12.140
into the general circulation.

00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:14.110
And that's the pattern
you've gotten already

00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:16.580
of neuroendocrine axis.

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:20.900
The brain releases a hormone
into the local circulation,

00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:23.220
which stimulates the
pituitary to release

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:26.660
a typical hormone in response
to it, which then goes and does

00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:28.690
something rather
to a distant gland.

00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:30.250
You've got that one already.

00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:34.630
You have Follicle Stimulating
Hormone, releasing hormone

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:38.400
up here, which triggers Follicle
Stimulating Hormone, which then

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:41.490
goes does something or other to
your follicles or to your sperm

00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:43.570
if you don't have
follicles, and these sort

00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:45.190
of three-step cascades.

00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:47.800
What we see with
the CRH system here

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:50.240
is one example of
how you can also

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:53.040
have a version of
multiple messengers.

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:57.370
Turns out CRH is not the
only hormone coming out

00:11:57.370 --> 00:12:00.960
of the base of the hypothalamus
that could release ACTH

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:02.520
during stress.

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:06.110
And instead, you've got
a whole array of these.

00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:08.940
There are neurons in the
hypothalamus that instead

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:12.300
release vasopressin into
the circulation here,

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:16.370
others that release
oxytocin, others that release

00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:19.200
norepinephrine, others
that release epinephrine.

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:21.030
And collectively,
what they're doing

00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:24.460
is stimulating the
release of ACTH.

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:27.110
You have an entire
array of these.

00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:29.220
And a huge amount
of work in the '80s

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:31.000
went into sorting this out.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.360
And what's going on here-- what
you have are stress signatures.

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:37.620
Different types
of stressors will

00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:43.680
trigger different orchestrations
of these ACTH-releasing neurons

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:46.220
up there-- different
orchestrations as to which

00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:48.160
hormones bring it about.

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:52.900
And it will be things like low
blood pressure or hypotension

00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:56.330
will tend to trigger
CRH and vasopressin.

00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:58.930
Low blood sugar,
I think, was CRH

00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:00.830
and epinephrine
and norepinephrine.

00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:03.600
The whole point is that
you get a signature up

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:06.520
at the hypothalamic
level regulating

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:08.860
this release of ACTH.

00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:12.260
Why have all these
different ways of doing it?

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:15.110
Two advantages--
one is depending

00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:20.120
on which orchestration of these
you use, the shape of the ACTH

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:23.090
secretory curve
will be different.

00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:24.700
It's the same deal here.

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:27.670
You use two of these to
get a short, rapid effect,

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:28.900
a more prolonged one.

00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:31.460
Here, depending on
which mixture you have,

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:35.560
you will have a different
profile of ACTH secretion.

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:38.510
That's so you get
control on that level.

00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:42.830
The other thing is that
each one of these not only

00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:45.590
helps to release ACTH
from the pituitary.

00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:48.450
It does other stuff
down here as well,

00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:53.230
so that you get a way of coding
under this sort of stressor

00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:57.240
you want to release ACTH and do
something or other in addition.

00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:59.590
The way you bring it about
is getting these two.

00:13:59.590 --> 00:14:01.670
With some other
stressor, you want

00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:05.390
to secrete ACTH, and bring about
some additional step there.

00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:08.420
And you do it with these
three-- that sort of thing.

00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:12.290
So you get control over the
shape of the stress response,

00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:14.340
and to fine tune it there.

00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:17.940
So here we've got this
completely more complicated

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:22.240
picture of all these
different releasers of ACTH.

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:25.160
In addition, just to make
things even more complicated,

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:30.360
there are clearly
hormones coming in there

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:34.870
which, instead of releasing
ACTH from the pituitary,

00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:37.530
they inhibit its release.

00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:40.850
And they release their hormone
into the circulation also.

00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:45.390
And people have had evidence for
these corticotropin-inhibiting

00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:48.500
factors for decades and
decades and decades.

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:52.230
And people have had an amazingly
tough time trying to figure out

00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:54.020
what these things actually are.

00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:56.720
The best implicated
molecule so far

00:14:56.720 --> 00:15:01.830
is a peptide called Delta
Sleep Inducing Factor.

00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:04.320
Think about that--
you go to sleep.

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:07.080
And that's a very good
time for turning off

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:09.010
your stress response.

00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:11.880
So that making
wonderful sense there.

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:14.120
The main point for
our purposes is

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:16.060
you've got
bi-directional control.

00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:17.750
You've got a bunch
of hormones that

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:20.040
stimulate the release of ACTH.

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:22.570
You've got at least one
fairly well-implicated

00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:23.944
that inhibits the release.

00:15:23.944 --> 00:15:25.860
There is no way that
there's not a whole bunch

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:29.060
of other ones doing the
same sort of signature

00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:30.890
coding at the inhibitory end.

00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:34.760
And you've got different ways of
translating different stressors

00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:36.780
into different
endocrine profiles.

00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:39.100
And of course, what
that winds up meaning

00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:42.755
is you get stressed-- like
your big toe is telling you

00:15:42.755 --> 00:15:46.480
you just burned it-- and you
are going to have projections

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:48.850
to a different array
of these than if you

00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:51.860
were getting stressed, you
were thinking about mortality.

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:54.100
That's going to be having
a different projection

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:55.840
profile onto these neurons.

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:58.470
What that suggests
is a huge amount

00:15:58.470 --> 00:16:01.240
of coding information
going on in the brain

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:05.260
and the spinal cord producing
these different arrangements

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:08.760
of how you dump out ACTH
and the other hormones.

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:11.570
OK, so that as a
first complication

00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:14.360
in these various neural
and endocrine systems.

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:17.490
You can actually have multiple
neurotransmitters coming out

00:16:17.490 --> 00:16:18.590
of the same neuron.

00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:21.260
You can have an array
of different hormones

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:23.900
that bring about the
same general response,

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:27.430
but they differ in terms
of fine-tuning the system.

00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:30.040
Next elaboration--
one now having

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:33.070
to do with some spatial
characteristics of how

00:16:33.070 --> 00:16:34.470
these systems work.

00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:37.570
And here we have the
same exact neuron again.

00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:40.850
And now we deal with
Dale's law number one,

00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:45.580
which is you know by now you
get the depolarization here,

00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:47.480
sufficient to get
to the axon hillock.

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:49.170
You get your action potential.

00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:52.570
All hell breaks loose-- very
exciting ionic of events

00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:55.790
of excitation-- all
or none regenerating

00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:58.960
go shooting down the axon
to the axon terminals.

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:03.670
Dale's lawyer number one was you
get an action potential started

00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:06.630
here, and it is going
to result in the release

00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:11.050
of neurotransmitter from
every single axon terminal.

00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:14.910
So Dale's two laws-- an
action potential causes

00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:17.990
neurotransmitter to be
released from every single axon

00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:19.280
terminal of a neuron.

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:21.720
Dale's law number
two just trashed.

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:25.170
And it's going to be the same
neurotransmitter released

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:27.170
from every single axon terminal.

00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:30.170
And Dale's law number one
has held reasonably well,

00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:31.840
except for some work by a guy.

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:35.610
And this is one of these sort
of mad geniuses of neuroscience,

00:17:35.610 --> 00:17:38.850
a guy at MIT named
Jerry Lettvin.

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:40.740
What he did was, as
far as I can tell,

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:44.310
he just sat around in a dark,
sort of abandoned warehouse

00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:45.629
for decades on end.

00:17:45.629 --> 00:17:47.170
And about once every
decade, he would

00:17:47.170 --> 00:17:49.930
write a paper that would
transform neuroscience.

00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:52.280
And he actually was like this.

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:53.240
I met the guy once.

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:56.120
And it was one of the more
terrifying experiences I had.

00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:58.350
I was working in
a lab where I had

00:17:58.350 --> 00:18:02.110
to go get an oscilloscope from
someplace, and pick up one

00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:03.370
because ours was broken.

00:18:03.370 --> 00:18:05.290
And everybody agreed
the place to find

00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:07.670
it was in Jerry
Lettvin's warehouse

00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:10.590
that he lived in, because
he lived with oscilloscopes.

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:14.690
And going in there, and it
was basically pitch dark.

00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:18.790
And there was this
sweaty, Sydney Greenstreet

00:18:18.790 --> 00:18:22.780
kind of guy sitting there.

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:24.990
And he was in a ripped t-shirt.

00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:26.780
And he had been in
there for decades.

00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:29.550
And he was chain smoking
and sweating in there,

00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:31.680
because it was 150 degrees.

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:34.900
So he spent a large part of the
last part of the 20th century

00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:38.590
inside that warehouse
writing one paper per decade

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:39.850
that was transforming.

00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:41.880
So this was his
particular paper.

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:43.890
And I think this one
was from the '70s.

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:47.180
And what he showed was that
under some circumstances,

00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:49.770
with him lined up with his
hundreds of oscilloscopes

00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:53.700
proving this, you in fact had a
violation of Dale's law number

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:57.190
one, which was you
can get blockades here

00:18:57.190 --> 00:18:59.540
or there that would
stop the action

00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:02.040
potential from
propagating down some

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:05.820
of the branches of this
whole axonal treee--

00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:09.770
in other words, a whole
different domain of controlling

00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:11.340
the flow of information.

00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:13.820
More subtlety
there-- neurons could

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:16.600
regulate which of
their branches actually

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:18.290
were sending on the message.

00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:21.690
And remarkably little has been
learned in the years since then

00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:25.600
as to how this works, let alone
how common a phenomenon it is.

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:27.120
Most people wound
up ignoring it.

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:32.610
What has since been shown
also is the wave of excitation

00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:35.380
that could come in through
different dendritic spines

00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:39.210
back at the end-- that there are
ways in which branch points can

00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:43.620
be sort of blocked on one side
so that the flow is shunted

00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:46.360
in one direction on the
branches and not the other.

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:48.610
This is this whole
unexplored world

00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:52.380
suggesting there's all
sorts of regulation going on

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:53.860
at these branch points.

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:56.640
It's not simply the
case, action potential

00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:58.610
and you are going to
dump neurotransmitter

00:19:58.610 --> 00:20:00.610
from every single axon terminal.

00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:03.350
So down goes Dale
on that one as well.

00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:07.310
Equivalent over at
the endocrine end--

00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:10.650
and here we have our
pituitary, which now no longer

00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:12.270
has a brain connected to it.

00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:14.290
But you've got the
theme by now, which

00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:16.030
is you've got the
hypothalamic hormone

00:20:16.030 --> 00:20:17.800
and out comes the
pituitary hormone.

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:20.820
And there's a whole bunch of
different pituitary hormones

00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:27.220
producing the acronym flat
bread, peg leg, flat, flat peg.

00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:33.540
FLAT PEG-- go to your death
bed remembering that acronym,

00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:38.960
because it will make
you happy and fulfilled.

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:41.240
OK, so here's a bunch
of pituitary hormones,

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:45.030
and whatever verkakte acronym
these guys came up with.

00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:48.030
But what we have here,
just to make life simpler,

00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:51.990
is we'll focus in
on four of them.

00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:56.500
FLAT PEG-- so we're
missing some of them there.

00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:59.450
But we've got growth
hormone that comes out,

00:20:59.450 --> 00:21:02.800
prolactin ACTH, Follicle
Stimulating Hormone.

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:04.960
I'm picking these
completely randomly.

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:07.650
OK, in the simplest
possible of worlds,

00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:11.320
you would have all sorts of
secretory cells, glandular

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:12.630
cells, sitting in here.

00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:15.620
And each one of them
is capable of secreting

00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:18.920
all of those flat bread
hormones coming out of there.

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:20.460
It could be doing that.

00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:23.480
And it would simply be choosing
which as a result of which

00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:26.860
hypothalamic hormone is
coming down the pike there.

00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:28.200
That's not what you see.

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:32.350
Instead, you have specialized
cells within the pituitary.

00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:35.930
There's one type that only
secretes growth hormone, which

00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:40.850
causes somatic growth, somatic
body, somatic something

00:21:40.850 --> 00:21:41.350
or other.

00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:43.110
And those are
called somatotrophs,

00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:44.310
and don't memorize that.

00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:46.790
Ones that only
secrete prolactin,

00:21:46.790 --> 00:21:51.660
which cause lactation-- these
are lactotrophs, corticotrophs,

00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:53.250
gonadotrophs,
something or other.

00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:56.430
So all of these, in fact,
have specialized cells.

00:21:56.430 --> 00:21:58.650
Within the pituitary,
there are cells

00:21:58.650 --> 00:22:00.920
that specialize in
releasing only one

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:03.600
of these types of hormones.

00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:04.530
So you got into that.

00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:06.850
So what would be the next
simplest thing going on?

00:22:06.850 --> 00:22:10.560
So here's the growth hormone
releasing into the pituitary,

00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:13.510
and there is going to be
the ACTH releasing end.

00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:15.910
No, that's not what you see.

00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:20.780
Instead, there is a mosaic all
across the pituitary of all

00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:24.010
the different flat bread
cell-secreting types there,

00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:25.480
all throughout it.

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:27.490
OK, so that's just this mosaic.

00:22:27.490 --> 00:22:30.660
Good, somebody was sloppy at
the sort of fetal end gluing it

00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:32.940
all together, and just
scattered them all over.

00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:34.980
And what winds up
happening is you

00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:37.660
get local, little
neighborhood effects.

00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:40.910
For example, here
we have somatotrophs

00:22:40.910 --> 00:22:42.360
that secrete growth hormone.

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:47.040
And one is in a FSH
neighborhood and the other

00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:48.710
is in a prolactin neighborhood.

00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:52.550
And what you see is you throw in
the hypothalamic hormone, which

00:22:52.550 --> 00:22:54.820
causes growth hormone
to get secreted.

00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:57.530
And this particular
cell is going

00:22:57.530 --> 00:23:00.580
to be secreting totally
different amounts of growth

00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:02.810
hormone than this one will.

00:23:02.810 --> 00:23:05.800
Because it's in a different
sort of neighborhood.

00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:07.800
And what's the
implication of that?

00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:10.010
There's all sorts
of communication

00:23:10.010 --> 00:23:14.750
going on between the individual
cells in the pituitary.

00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:17.450
And it depends on what
sort of neighborhood

00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:19.620
each particular
cell is living in,

00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:23.080
how it is responding to the
hypothalamic signal coming

00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:25.950
down, wildly complicating.

00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:29.470
What that lets you do
instead is different areas

00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:33.760
of the hypothalamus will turf
its hormones to different parts

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:36.470
of the pituitary where
its particular cell

00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:38.760
targets will be living
in different sorts

00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:39.700
of neighborhoods.

00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:44.400
Simply more regulation, more
complexity going on there.

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:48.860
Next theme that comes through
in terms of elaboration--

00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:51.610
we all have the negative
feedback concept by now

00:23:51.610 --> 00:23:54.830
that came through throughout
the lectures last week.

00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:58.150
The whole notion
you get excited.

00:23:58.150 --> 00:24:01.020
You release a neurotransmitter
into your synapse

00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:02.230
if you're a neuron.

00:24:02.230 --> 00:24:04.240
You've got to do some
regulation there.

00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:06.390
You have to clean
up after yourself.

00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:09.390
You remove the neurotransmitter
from the synapse.

00:24:09.390 --> 00:24:11.430
You break down the
neurotransmitter.

00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:13.200
You have to finish
the whole thing.

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:14.930
You are the endocrine system.

00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:15.770
You are the brain.

00:24:15.770 --> 00:24:17.560
And you have gotten
it into your head

00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:22.130
that you want your adrenals
to secrete glucocorticoids.

00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:24.430
And you start that whole
cascade in which everywhere--

00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:27.710
and you need to know
when to stop secreting

00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:29.120
those hormones up on top.

00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:31.800
You need negative
feedback information.

00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:34.740
All of these biological
systems are characterized

00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:40.110
by that-- you have enzymes
where this enzyme turns this

00:24:40.110 --> 00:24:41.340
into this.

00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:43.760
And how does it know when
they should stop doing it?

00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:45.220
When there is so
much of this stuff

00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:48.530
building up that this
inhibits its activity.

00:24:48.530 --> 00:24:52.210
You get negative feedback,
feedback regulation.

00:24:52.210 --> 00:24:53.910
You're making a lot of x.

00:24:53.910 --> 00:24:56.950
And whatever is making it
has to be able to measure

00:24:56.950 --> 00:24:58.300
the levels of x.

00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:01.870
That is the simple rule of all
this negative feedback stuff.

00:25:01.870 --> 00:25:08.970
So a first example on the
neurobiological level-- so

00:25:08.970 --> 00:25:12.980
what we have are what are
called auto receptors.

00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:16.630
What I inferred before,
which is this weirdo world

00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:18.920
in which you not only
will have receptors

00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:21.570
for a neurotransmitter
exactly where they should

00:25:21.570 --> 00:25:24.250
be on the post-synaptic
neuron on the other side

00:25:24.250 --> 00:25:28.430
of the synapse, but you will
have them on the neuron that's

00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:30.390
releasing the neurotransmitter.

00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:31.970
It is an auto receptor.

00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:34.930
It is a receptor
right there on it.

00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:36.240
What's it doing?

00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:38.500
It's for bookkeeping.

00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:41.160
What you have is
some sort of rule.

00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:43.960
If the neurotransmitters
come pouring out of there,

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:46.930
and most of them go floating
across-- let's assume

00:25:46.930 --> 00:25:48.960
these are only red
neurotransmitters here,

00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:52.920
and bind to their
red receptors there,

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:54.770
and do their thing
to the next neuron.

00:25:54.770 --> 00:25:57.160
And just thanks to
the floating around,

00:25:57.160 --> 00:26:00.830
random life in the Brownian
synaptic sludge there,

00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:03.340
a certain number of them
are going to, instead, bind

00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:04.250
to this one.

00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:06.620
And all there has
to be is some sort

00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:09.950
of rule in this
pre-synaptic neuron

00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:12.520
that for every time
one of these hits here,

00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:15.410
it means I've
released 1,000 copies

00:26:15.410 --> 00:26:18.570
of this neurotransmitter,
or 1,000 molecules of that.

00:26:18.570 --> 00:26:21.810
And that's how I keep
track of the numbers.

00:26:21.810 --> 00:26:23.560
And I will have
a rule that if it

00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:25.780
gets below a certain
level of my picking

00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:28.120
up this bookkeeping
signal, that will

00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:30.670
be a signal to start
making more of the stuff.

00:26:30.670 --> 00:26:32.350
If I'm getting too
much of a signal,

00:26:32.350 --> 00:26:37.300
decrease the release-- feedback
regulation along those realms.

00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:40.470
This is where you see
one of the elaborations

00:26:40.470 --> 00:26:42.700
on this two-neurotransmitter
business.

00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:47.330
What you very often see is
one of the neurotransmitters

00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:52.000
will exclusively work on a
pre-synaptic auto-receptor.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.930
That one is stuck
in there merely

00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:57.140
in order to do the bookkeeping.

00:26:57.140 --> 00:26:59.320
You would think neurons
might have figured out

00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:01.090
a more direct way
of keeping track,

00:27:01.090 --> 00:27:03.010
like how many
vesicles they dump.

00:27:03.010 --> 00:27:05.000
But instead, this
theme is there is

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.790
some pre-synaptic
auto-receptor, which tells you

00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:13.460
on some statistical basis, every
time we get buzzed at this end,

00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:16.480
it means we buzz these
guys 100 zillion times.

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:20.260
And that's how we keep track
of how much we want to make--

00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:22.710
negative feedback loops there.

00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:26.010
You then see the
exact same equivalent

00:27:26.010 --> 00:27:30.101
in endocrine systems, which
is all this negative feedback

00:27:30.101 --> 00:27:30.600
stuff.

00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:32.520
Something that was
under-emphasized

00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:35.050
in the endocrine
lectures last week

00:27:35.050 --> 00:27:37.550
has been this element
of neuroendocrinology.

00:27:37.550 --> 00:27:39.540
What you mostly
heard about is what's

00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:41.710
going to be most
dominating in the classes

00:27:41.710 --> 00:27:44.870
to come, which is hormones
get into the brain

00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:48.900
and change how you think,
and feel, and behave,

00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:50.150
and all of that stuff.

00:27:50.150 --> 00:27:53.070
But also, some of the time what
hormones are doing in the brain

00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:55.510
is letting the brain know
how much hormones there

00:27:55.510 --> 00:27:57.190
were in the
circulation, in order

00:27:57.190 --> 00:28:01.170
to do the bookkeeping, the
negative feedback regulation.

00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:04.620
Your brain decides it wants
to have this much growth

00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:06.440
hormone in the bloodstream.

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:10.080
And thus, it releases
its hypothalamic hormone,

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:10.740
which goes.

00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:13.591
And all over, the pituitary
gets those somatotrophs

00:28:13.591 --> 00:28:15.840
to release growth hormone
and does its thing elsewhere

00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:16.520
in the body.

00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:18.480
And the brain has
to be measuring

00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:22.950
some consequence of that
growth hormone doing its thing,

00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:25.200
measuring up there, in
order to figure out,

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:27.790
have we gotten where
we want to yet?

00:28:27.790 --> 00:28:29.280
Same thing with prolactin.

00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:31.070
Same thing with
every one of those.

00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:34.420
You have to have negative
feedback regulation.

00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:36.670
So what do you need to
do to pull that off?

00:28:36.670 --> 00:28:39.060
You need to have a
part of the brain that

00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:43.930
is sensitive to that hormone
signal-- sensitive in some sort

00:28:43.930 --> 00:28:48.060
of quantitative way, where
it can, in effect, count

00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:51.060
how much of the stuff there
is in the bloodstream using

00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:53.060
the exact same sort of rule.

00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:56.200
If I've had one of those
hormones in the circulation

00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:58.890
come and bind to
one of my receptors,

00:28:58.890 --> 00:29:01.940
it means I have released
100 billion copies of it,

00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:04.080
thanks to my starting
this whole cascade.

00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:05.390
Did we want 100 billion?

00:29:05.390 --> 00:29:07.010
Did we want 107 billion?

00:29:07.010 --> 00:29:08.960
Do we want 93 billion?

00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:09.970
What do we do now?

00:29:09.970 --> 00:29:12.880
Does that tell us we've
completed what we want?

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:15.750
You get this negative
feedback signal there.

00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:17.240
So the first thing
you have to have

00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:21.130
is cells-- parts of the
brain-- that will measure,

00:29:21.130 --> 00:29:24.790
that will be responsive
to a hormone signal.

00:29:24.790 --> 00:29:28.800
Those cells have to be able
to have some kind of set point

00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:29.940
rule in there.

00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:32.620
This is the point of
life that I am at,

00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:34.460
the point of my menstrual cycle.

00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:37.110
This is the point of
reaching adolescence.

00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:39.410
This is the point of
am I stressed or not?

00:29:39.410 --> 00:29:40.530
This is the set point.

00:29:40.530 --> 00:29:42.560
This is the amount
of hormone I would

00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:44.520
like to have in
the bloodstream--

00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:46.550
this particular type of hormone.

00:29:46.550 --> 00:29:49.040
And what you need to
then be able to do

00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:53.500
is, if levels have not
reached that set point yet,

00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:57.790
you send a stimulatory
signal to the hypothalamus.

00:29:57.790 --> 00:29:59.650
Keep doing what you were doing.

00:29:59.650 --> 00:30:01.950
We need to push the
levels up higher.

00:30:01.950 --> 00:30:04.950
And if the levels reach
here or get even higher,

00:30:04.950 --> 00:30:09.130
you need to be able to turn this
into an inhibitory signal going

00:30:09.130 --> 00:30:10.900
to the hypothalamus.

00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:13.440
So what you see are
all sorts of regions

00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:17.260
of the brain that are sensitive
to these various hormones, not

00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:19.050
just in terms of
hormones affecting

00:30:19.050 --> 00:30:20.950
all the behaviors we're
going to hear about,

00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:25.840
but also negative feedback
regulation-- so a way now

00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:29.190
of showing just how much
more complicated it can be.

00:30:29.190 --> 00:30:31.560
So what would you assume
is the general rule?

00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:35.750
Here's an example of--
OK, let's make it simpler.

00:30:38.850 --> 00:30:40.530
OK, so what would
you expect to see?

00:30:40.530 --> 00:30:43.300
You're able to
measure CRH coming out

00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:44.920
of the base of the hypothalamus.

00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:48.660
And the deal is something
stressful occurs,

00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:50.900
and so it's pumping out CRH.

00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:54.530
And at some point, you've
got as much glucocorticoids

00:30:54.530 --> 00:30:56.150
in the blood stream
as the brain would

00:30:56.150 --> 00:30:57.860
like for that sort of stressor.

00:30:57.860 --> 00:30:59.540
And that leads to
the negative feedback

00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:01.260
signal, which stops
the hypothalamus

00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:02.720
from releasing CRH.

00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:05.960
What measuring is
the brain doing?

00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:08.260
Most obvious version
would be what

00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:12.720
the brain does is measure
how much glucocorticoids

00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:14.530
are in the bloodstream.

00:31:14.530 --> 00:31:17.240
And a simple rule, the
more glucocorticoids

00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:19.910
there are in the bloodstream,
the more likely levels

00:31:19.910 --> 00:31:22.750
are to have reached
the threshold, the set

00:31:22.750 --> 00:31:24.060
point, that you want.

00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:27.470
So the higher the levels, the
more of a negative feedback

00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:28.150
signal.

00:31:28.150 --> 00:31:31.760
And thus, the less
CRH being secreted.

00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:34.170
Totally straightforward,
logical,

00:31:34.170 --> 00:31:38.380
measuring the level of
hormone in the bloodstream.

00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:41.810
And this is how most endocrine
negative feedback works.

00:31:41.810 --> 00:31:43.680
Measuring how much
of the stuff--

00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:46.630
the more stuff there is,
the greater the likelihood

00:31:46.630 --> 00:31:48.340
that you shut down the system.

00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:50.270
You put in the negative
feedback signal.

00:31:50.270 --> 00:31:53.960
But in addition, there's
a whole other domain

00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:57.040
of glucocorticoid negative
feedback regulation,

00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:59.860
where in this domain,
what the brain

00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:03.550
is doing is not measuring
how much glucocorticoids

00:32:03.550 --> 00:32:06.470
there are in the
bloodstream, but measuring

00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:11.550
the rate of change-- the rate
at which levels are increasing.

00:32:11.550 --> 00:32:16.450
And that's a totally different
domain of information there.

00:32:16.450 --> 00:32:18.230
Now what you're
doing is measuring

00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:22.330
how many units of increase
per second are you getting.

00:32:22.330 --> 00:32:25.220
And what you've got is
this bizarre world there,

00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:29.220
where you go from 10
units of glucocorticoids

00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:32.820
in the bloodstream to
12 units in one minute.

00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:34.410
And that means the
same exact thing

00:32:34.410 --> 00:32:37.910
as going from a million
and 10 units to a million

00:32:37.910 --> 00:32:40.510
and 12 units in the
same length of time.

00:32:40.510 --> 00:32:42.760
It's not measuring
absolute levels.

00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:44.730
It's measuring rate of change.

00:32:44.730 --> 00:32:49.040
And the faster the rate of
change, the less likely CRH

00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:50.620
is to get secreted.

00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:53.990
And it turns out there are some
domains of stress responses

00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:55.920
where what the brain
is paying attention to

00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:58.730
is rate of change of
hormone in the bloodstream.

00:32:58.730 --> 00:33:01.360
There are other circumstances
where it's paying attention

00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:02.740
to absolute level.

00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:05.110
This tends to be what
the brain listens

00:33:05.110 --> 00:33:08.510
to very early on in
a stress response.

00:33:08.510 --> 00:33:10.790
This tends to be the
more delayed response.

00:33:10.790 --> 00:33:15.140
But totally different dynamics
there-- cells that measure

00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:18.060
the amount of
hormone-- that's not

00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:21.690
that hard to imagine-- number
of receptors, stuff like that.

00:33:21.690 --> 00:33:24.390
Cells that measure
the rate of change,

00:33:24.390 --> 00:33:27.220
where going from 10 to 12
is the exact same thing

00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:29.960
as going from a million
10 to a million 12.

00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:32.630
What is that wiring
going to be like?

00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:34.700
To this day, nobody has a clue.

00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:37.435
This was first sort of
figured out in the 1960s.

00:33:37.435 --> 00:33:40.130
An amazing scientist
up in UCSF named

00:33:40.130 --> 00:33:44.420
Mary Dallman who just sat and
out of sheer just modeling

00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:46.570
work in terms of
endocrine systems

00:33:46.570 --> 00:33:48.740
predicted with
glucocorticoids, there

00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:51.420
are going to be two different
domains of feedback.

00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:54.940
There is going to be a rapid
rate-of-change sensitive

00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:55.610
system.

00:33:55.610 --> 00:33:58.620
There is going to be a
delayed level of hormone

00:33:58.620 --> 00:33:59.930
in the bloodstream system.

00:33:59.930 --> 00:34:02.040
And here's exactly why
I'm predicting this.

00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:03.790
And she turned out to
be absolutely right.

00:34:03.790 --> 00:34:06.420
And decades later,
people still don't fully

00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:09.830
understand how a cell
measures the rate of change

00:34:09.830 --> 00:34:13.260
of something independent
of the absolute levels.

00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:15.210
One thing that makes
life a little bit easier

00:34:15.210 --> 00:34:18.199
is it's different parts
of the nervous system

00:34:18.199 --> 00:34:20.739
that do each type here.

00:34:20.739 --> 00:34:24.280
The very rapid rate-of-change
stuff, in fact,

00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:26.429
is not even occurring
at the brain.

00:34:26.429 --> 00:34:29.310
It's occurring at the
level of the pituitary.

00:34:29.310 --> 00:34:33.850
And thus, it's not so much
regulating CRH release,

00:34:33.850 --> 00:34:36.199
but ACTH release.

00:34:36.199 --> 00:34:39.330
OK, complicated-- the
main point of that

00:34:39.330 --> 00:34:42.659
is, even something
as logical as how

00:34:42.659 --> 00:34:45.020
do you keep your toilet
bowl sort of thing

00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:47.530
from overflowing the
tank in the back there?

00:34:47.530 --> 00:34:49.780
You need a negative
feedback signal.

00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:52.230
You need a way for
the toilet bowl tank

00:34:52.230 --> 00:34:55.360
to measure how much water there
is there, and the flotation

00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:59.390
device, and for that to have
a set point and a way of then

00:34:59.390 --> 00:35:02.880
transducing, reaching that
point into putting the lid

00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:06.230
on the top of the pipe
that's generating the water.

00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:09.190
Totally all these logical
negative feedback loop stuff,

00:35:09.190 --> 00:35:12.530
and then suddenly, in these
neuroendocrine systems,

00:35:12.530 --> 00:35:16.870
you get much, much more subtle,
complicated things going on.

00:35:16.870 --> 00:35:20.480
In some cases, you
have positive feedback.

00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:22.580
The more of a hormone
in the bloodstream,

00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:25.190
the more you stimulate
the system to do more.

00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:28.006
You get that at certain
points in reproduction--

00:35:28.006 --> 00:35:29.380
reproductive life
histories where

00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:32.760
you have massive changes
of estrogen, progesterone.

00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:35.550
And what you have will be
transient periods where

00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:37.210
you have positive feedback.

00:35:37.210 --> 00:35:41.070
All of these somehow have to
get translated into how cells

00:35:41.070 --> 00:35:43.560
are working-- very unclear.

00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:47.780
OK, so negative feedback-- the
next elaboration-- something

00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:50.810
going on at the receptor level.

00:35:50.810 --> 00:35:53.685
It's something known
as auto-regulation.

00:35:53.685 --> 00:35:55.980
And you could probably
begin to figure out what

00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:57.130
that one's about.

00:35:57.130 --> 00:35:59.690
And it will make perfect
sense as follows--

00:35:59.690 --> 00:36:02.580
if somebody screams
at you all the time,

00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:04.540
you stop listening to them.

00:36:04.540 --> 00:36:08.800
And what you have done is just
down-regulated your sensitivity

00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:10.830
to this pain-in-the-neck person.

00:36:10.830 --> 00:36:13.520
If they give a
very large signal,

00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:17.170
you down-regulate your
sensitivity to the signal.

00:36:17.170 --> 00:36:20.090
If a signal, instead,
becomes very weak,

00:36:20.090 --> 00:36:24.070
very often you will increase
the attention you pay to it.

00:36:24.070 --> 00:36:27.370
You are showing auto-regulation.

00:36:27.370 --> 00:36:30.010
Within the realm of
neuroendocrine stuff,

00:36:30.010 --> 00:36:33.800
you will be changing
the amount of receptor

00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:36.510
for a neurotransmitter
or hormone

00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:39.940
as a function of the
levels in the bloodstream.

00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:42.290
And thus, you have
this logic-- if you

00:36:42.290 --> 00:36:45.830
get a huge increase in
the levels of some hormone

00:36:45.830 --> 00:36:48.260
in the blood stream,
there will be a likelihood

00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:50.680
that various target
tissues will begin

00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:56.350
to down-regulate the number
of receptors for that hormone

00:36:56.350 --> 00:36:57.520
or neurotransmitter.

00:36:57.520 --> 00:37:00.250
Conversely, levels go way
down, they go right up.

00:37:00.250 --> 00:37:02.790
And this is a
general feature all

00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:05.500
these neural and
endocrine systems.

00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:07.050
Why is that interesting?

00:37:07.050 --> 00:37:11.170
When this regulatory,
auto-regulatory stuff

00:37:11.170 --> 00:37:12.860
screws up.

00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:15.440
In principle, it
should work perfectly.

00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:18.230
OK, for some reason,
there's a doubling

00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:19.880
of the hormone
message coming through

00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:22.270
in the bloodstream
under some circumstance

00:37:22.270 --> 00:37:24.290
where it's going
on for a long time.

00:37:24.290 --> 00:37:25.390
And that's not right.

00:37:25.390 --> 00:37:27.630
And somebody down at
some gland down there

00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:30.430
is messing up and drooling
out way too much hormone.

00:37:30.430 --> 00:37:31.610
So what are we going to do?

00:37:31.610 --> 00:37:33.290
We have no idea
what's up with them.

00:37:33.290 --> 00:37:35.490
But you've doubled
the level of hormone.

00:37:35.490 --> 00:37:37.830
Most folks down
there, OK, let's have

00:37:37.830 --> 00:37:40.180
an auto-regulatory response.

00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:42.570
Let's cut the number
of our receptors

00:37:42.570 --> 00:37:44.500
in half to compensate.

00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:47.190
You can see in a rough way
that's going to compensate.

00:37:47.190 --> 00:37:51.240
So massively increase the
signal thanks to some disease

00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:55.050
state, something weird going on,
and do a compensatory decrease.

00:37:55.050 --> 00:37:57.070
Have some disease
or abnormal state

00:37:57.070 --> 00:37:59.070
where levels of some
hormone or neurotransmitter

00:37:59.070 --> 00:38:01.220
go way down-- what do you do?

00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:05.140
Let's up the amount of receptor
enough to compensate for it.

00:38:05.140 --> 00:38:06.280
That's great.

00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:10.660
Where problems occur is if you
don't compensate quite enough,

00:38:10.660 --> 00:38:14.860
or if you overshoot, if you
begin to get a mismatch.

00:38:14.860 --> 00:38:17.260
And that's where
you've got problems.

00:38:17.260 --> 00:38:20.400
We will see, as you read
in the [INAUDIBLE] book--

00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:23.560
with hopefully great detail--
the chapter on depression,

00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:26.650
that's probably a critical
thing that's happening.

00:38:26.650 --> 00:38:29.780
Because we'll see with
depression what's probably

00:38:29.780 --> 00:38:32.640
wrong are levels of a few
different neurotransmitters--

00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:35.370
serotonin, dopamine,
norepinephrine.

00:38:35.370 --> 00:38:37.240
All of this is
going to come soon.

00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:40.370
And all of the standard
anti-depressant drugs

00:38:40.370 --> 00:38:43.340
change the levels of
these neurotransmitters

00:38:43.340 --> 00:38:44.500
in the bloodstream.

00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:45.680
And that's great.

00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:48.250
And we know just how it
works, except there's always

00:38:48.250 --> 00:38:50.080
a problem making sense of that.

00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:54.114
Which is you throw in some of
these standard drugs-- SSRIs,

00:38:54.114 --> 00:38:56.280
things of that sort-- don't
worry about the details.

00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:57.800
All of this will come later.

00:38:57.800 --> 00:39:00.950
The main point being that
these anti-depressant drugs,

00:39:00.950 --> 00:39:03.140
when you throw them
in, they're changing

00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:06.990
levels of neurotransmitters
within minutes to hours.

00:39:06.990 --> 00:39:09.730
You get somebody who
is deeply depressed.

00:39:09.730 --> 00:39:12.880
And you start them off
on an SSRI like Prozac.

00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:16.310
And they don't start feeling
better for days to weeks.

00:39:16.310 --> 00:39:20.000
There is some sort of
lag time going on there.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:21.990
And as people have
sorted it out,

00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:24.670
what the common sort
of conclusion is,

00:39:24.670 --> 00:39:26.870
these drugs are
not working so much

00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:29.830
by changing the levels of
these neurotransmitters.

00:39:29.830 --> 00:39:33.580
What they're really doing
is by changing the levels,

00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:37.640
they are eventually going to
cause an auto-regulatory change

00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:39.540
in the number of receptors.

00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:41.990
And these change within
minutes to hours.

00:39:41.990 --> 00:39:44.100
These change within
days to weeks.

00:39:44.100 --> 00:39:47.070
And that's what these
drugs are probably doing.

00:39:47.070 --> 00:39:48.230
We will go through that.

00:39:48.230 --> 00:39:51.602
Just to give you a sense of
how awful it is going to get,

00:39:51.602 --> 00:39:53.310
there are some reasons
to think that some

00:39:53.310 --> 00:39:55.710
of these anti-depressant
drugs work

00:39:55.710 --> 00:39:58.600
not by changing the level so
much of this neurotransmitter,

00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:00.550
or not so much
secondarily causing

00:40:00.550 --> 00:40:03.410
an auto-regulatory
change here, but instead,

00:40:03.410 --> 00:40:08.300
causing an auto-regulatory
change in these auto-receptors.

00:40:08.300 --> 00:40:09.980
Unbelievably complicated.

00:40:09.980 --> 00:40:10.920
We will come to that.

00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:13.360
For our purposes
right now, what that

00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:16.220
begins to tell you
is that certainly,

00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:18.960
the amount of hormone and the
amount of neurotransmitter

00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:19.930
makes a difference.

00:40:19.930 --> 00:40:21.980
The amount of receptor, as well.

00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:24.310
And have big
pathological changes

00:40:24.310 --> 00:40:26.130
in the levels of the messengers.

00:40:26.130 --> 00:40:30.640
The body attempts to regulate
with auto-regulatory changes.

00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:32.760
And a lot of what
disease is about

00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:35.740
is overshooting
or undershooting.

00:40:35.740 --> 00:40:38.270
So that's one realm within
the nervous system--

00:40:38.270 --> 00:40:40.236
neurotransmitters--
pertinent to depression.

00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:45.980
OK within endocrine
systems, an equivalent one

00:40:45.980 --> 00:40:47.760
is as follows--
something that you

00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:51.150
see that goes wrong in
diabetes-- adult-onset

00:40:51.150 --> 00:40:52.650
diabetes.

00:40:52.650 --> 00:40:55.640
One of the things you have
is a number of ways things

00:40:55.640 --> 00:40:56.430
can go wrong.

00:40:56.430 --> 00:40:58.910
But what your body
does is, when there's

00:40:58.910 --> 00:41:01.180
glucose in the bloodstream,
when you've just

00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:03.410
had a meal, when you
have all these nutrients

00:41:03.410 --> 00:41:05.450
in the bloodstream,
your pancreas

00:41:05.450 --> 00:41:08.150
can detect the levels of
glucose in your bloodstream

00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:10.390
and secretes insulin.

00:41:10.390 --> 00:41:12.610
Sugar shows up in the
bloodstream-- glucose.

00:41:12.610 --> 00:41:13.790
You secrete insulin.

00:41:13.790 --> 00:41:16.890
And what insulin does
is tell your fat cells

00:41:16.890 --> 00:41:19.790
to absorb the sugar
and store it away.

00:41:19.790 --> 00:41:22.960
Great, but you've
got a problem, which

00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:26.260
is that your fat cells
are already full.

00:41:26.260 --> 00:41:29.020
Because you are a typical
Westernized human,

00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:30.780
and you've been
eating to excess.

00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:34.290
And what you have is fat
cells that are full up.

00:41:34.290 --> 00:41:37.550
And they stop listening
to insulin, because they

00:41:37.550 --> 00:41:38.620
can't take it anymore.

00:41:38.620 --> 00:41:41.900
Because they can't take up any
more stuff and store it away.

00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:45.690
The cells begin to
be insulin resistant.

00:41:45.690 --> 00:41:48.020
And we'll see in a
minute how that works.

00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:50.630
So suddenly, you
have fat cells that

00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:52.390
aren't responding to insulin.

00:41:52.390 --> 00:41:55.724
And what happens is your
pancreas says, this is crazy.

00:41:55.724 --> 00:41:58.140
We're trying to get rid of the
sugar from the bloodstream.

00:41:58.140 --> 00:41:59.260
And it's not disappearing.

00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:01.250
The person just ate
eight Hershey bars,

00:42:01.250 --> 00:42:03.220
and their fat cells
are already full.

00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:05.890
But we're not clearing the
sugar out of the bloodstream.

00:42:05.890 --> 00:42:08.180
So let's secrete
even more insulin.

00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:10.190
And let's secrete
even more insulin.

00:42:10.190 --> 00:42:12.880
And what happens at the
fat cells, they say,

00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:14.520
this is ridiculous.

00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:15.460
We're full up.

00:42:15.460 --> 00:42:16.120
Forget it.

00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:19.000
We're not taking up any more
of these nutrient things.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:20.950
And in fact, what
we're going to do is,

00:42:20.950 --> 00:42:23.600
we're going to decrease
the number of our insulin

00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:24.640
receptors.

00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:28.890
We're going to down-regulate
our number of insulin receptors.

00:42:28.890 --> 00:42:32.210
And the pancreas freaks out,
and secretes even more insulin

00:42:32.210 --> 00:42:33.030
as a result.

00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:34.800
And you down-regulate even more.

00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:38.280
And what you have is
this downward spiral.

00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:40.540
Because at some
point, your pancreas

00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:44.200
is working so hard to dump
these boatloads of insulin

00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:47.470
into the bloodstream that your
body's paying no attention to,

00:42:47.470 --> 00:42:50.430
that you burn out the
cells in your pancreas that

00:42:50.430 --> 00:42:51.560
make insulin.

00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:54.720
And now you've got yourself
a real serious problem.

00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:57.110
What's the key of
what's gone wrong here?

00:42:57.110 --> 00:43:00.010
Too much nutrients, and
thus too much insulin.

00:43:00.010 --> 00:43:02.037
And the fat cells
begin to say, we're

00:43:02.037 --> 00:43:03.120
not going to listen to it.

00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:04.780
And they down-regulate
receptors.

00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:07.510
More insulin, down-regulate,
down-regulate-- and this

00:43:07.510 --> 00:43:10.440
is at the core of what
goes wrong in diabetes.

00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:13.190
So we see these
auto-regulatory changes.

00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:15.230
And they can emerge slowly.

00:43:15.230 --> 00:43:17.850
They can help explain why
some of these drugs work.

00:43:17.850 --> 00:43:20.050
Almost certainly,
they help explain

00:43:20.050 --> 00:43:22.600
what's wrong in some of
these psychiatric diseases,

00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:24.110
metabolic diseases.

00:43:24.110 --> 00:43:25.630
What's the punchline there?

00:43:25.630 --> 00:43:28.920
Number one, the amount of
a messenger is important,

00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:31.770
but the sensitivity
to the messenger

00:43:31.770 --> 00:43:33.370
is at least as important.

00:43:33.370 --> 00:43:36.480
You have as much
capacity to regulate this

00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:38.890
as this in these
biological systems,

00:43:38.890 --> 00:43:40.640
and thus you have
as much potential

00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:43.900
for screwing up at
this end as screwing up

00:43:43.900 --> 00:43:45.440
with the amount of messenger.

00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:47.760
Yeah, did I see a
hand up someplace?

00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:48.722
Yes.

00:43:48.722 --> 00:43:55.080
[INAUDIBLE] but wouldn't
the SSRI example, then,

00:43:55.080 --> 00:43:58.380
be the opposite of what
you're saying [INAUDIBLE]?

00:43:58.380 --> 00:44:01.845
Because you'd expect
increasing neurotransmitters

00:44:01.845 --> 00:44:04.815
to eventually cause a
decrease in receptors.

00:44:04.815 --> 00:44:08.800
So you should see
that [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:10.800
Great, OK.

00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:12.680
Don't listen to
anything she just said,

00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:16.550
because she's just gotten to an
incredibly subtle, complicated

00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:18.470
point about how
this stuff works.

00:44:18.470 --> 00:44:21.850
Go and read, and memorize,
and recite to your roommates

00:44:21.850 --> 00:44:24.375
the section on the zebra
chapter about-- the section

00:44:24.375 --> 00:44:26.520
in zebras-- on
depression, looking

00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:29.930
at the paradoxical things
where, at the end of the day,

00:44:29.930 --> 00:44:33.710
people are not sure say, an
SSRI, a selective serotonin

00:44:33.710 --> 00:44:35.110
re-uptake inhibitor.

00:44:35.110 --> 00:44:38.400
What it does is it blocks
the re-uptake of serotonin.

00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:41.050
And thus, you wind up with more
serotonin in the bloodstream.

00:44:41.050 --> 00:44:42.560
Somebody feels less depressed.

00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:45.440
I bet their problem was they
didn't have enough serotonin.

00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:48.790
Work through the logic of all
this auto-regulatory stuff

00:44:48.790 --> 00:44:49.540
going on.

00:44:49.540 --> 00:44:52.010
And people still
are not positive

00:44:52.010 --> 00:44:55.750
if the problem with depression
is too little serotonin or too

00:44:55.750 --> 00:44:56.540
much.

00:44:56.540 --> 00:45:00.560
Because depending on whether
the auto-regulation partially

00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:04.030
compensates, completely,
whether it overshoots,

00:45:04.030 --> 00:45:06.340
and whether it's these
receptors or these,

00:45:06.340 --> 00:45:08.560
will completely determine
whether the problem

00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:12.320
is too much or too little of a
neurotransmitter-- incredibly

00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:15.190
complicated, exactly some
of the complexities there.

00:45:15.190 --> 00:45:17.350
And that is so
complicated, in fact,

00:45:17.350 --> 00:45:19.080
that it is essential
that everybody

00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:21.530
stand up now and go to the
bathroom for five minutes.

00:45:21.530 --> 00:45:25.970
OK, again, back from the
other [INAUDIBLE] day.

00:45:25.970 --> 00:45:28.280
Your pituitary is
releasing all sorts

00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:31.720
of different types of
hormones under the control

00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:34.050
of all sorts of different
types of hormones

00:45:34.050 --> 00:45:36.580
signaling from the brain.

00:45:36.580 --> 00:45:39.590
What you get is, the
pituitary is not just

00:45:39.590 --> 00:45:42.650
made up of one type of
cell that can secrete

00:45:42.650 --> 00:45:44.850
every single type of
hormone and response

00:45:44.850 --> 00:45:47.660
to each type there of
messenger from the brain.

00:45:47.660 --> 00:45:50.060
Instead, you've got
specialized cells.

00:45:50.060 --> 00:45:52.330
You've got types
of pituitary cells

00:45:52.330 --> 00:45:54.520
that only secrete
prolactin in response

00:45:54.520 --> 00:45:57.772
to what's happening there,
types that only secrete ACTH,

00:45:57.772 --> 00:46:01.920
or secrete luteinizing hormone,
follicle stimulating hormone,

00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:03.020
so on.

00:46:03.020 --> 00:46:05.470
OK, so they're
specialized cells.

00:46:05.470 --> 00:46:09.490
Rather than having one part
of the pituitary, which

00:46:09.490 --> 00:46:12.520
is the we're in charge of
secreting growth hormone

00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:15.940
neighborhood, and one part
that's the we do prolactin,

00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:18.660
and rather than it being
broken up like that,

00:46:18.660 --> 00:46:22.355
instead, it's just a mosaic of
all the different types that

00:46:22.355 --> 00:46:24.480
are scattered throughout there.

00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:28.330
So that would initially just
seem like sheer sloppiness.

00:46:28.330 --> 00:46:30.550
Embryology-- they didn't
quite get it together

00:46:30.550 --> 00:46:33.010
to have discrete neighborhoods,
that sort of thing.

00:46:33.010 --> 00:46:34.770
But it's just scattered there.

00:46:34.770 --> 00:46:37.060
What's interesting
about that is,

00:46:37.060 --> 00:46:42.370
you will see any given
cell in the pituitary

00:46:42.370 --> 00:46:46.070
will go about its
business, which

00:46:46.070 --> 00:46:49.960
is responding to its
specific hypothalamic signal

00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:54.290
by secreting whichever
hormone it specializes in.

00:46:54.290 --> 00:46:57.020
Every single cell in
the pituitary going

00:46:57.020 --> 00:47:00.660
about its business will be
a little bit more or less

00:47:00.660 --> 00:47:04.290
sensitive to its
hypothalamic signal,

00:47:04.290 --> 00:47:08.080
depending on what sort of
neighborhood it's living in,

00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:11.640
depending on which other
types of these cells

00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:13.290
it's surrounded by.

00:47:13.290 --> 00:47:17.340
So that you will
get, for example,

00:47:17.340 --> 00:47:19.830
FSH secreting cells,
when they tend

00:47:19.830 --> 00:47:23.960
to be in a GH
neighborhood, are far more

00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:25.920
responsive to their
signal than when

00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:28.670
they're in an ACTH
neighborhood or one that's

00:47:28.670 --> 00:47:30.580
a hodgepodge of any of these.

00:47:30.580 --> 00:47:32.080
I don't know what the rules are.

00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:34.620
But what you've got
there are increased

00:47:34.620 --> 00:47:37.840
ways for regulation of
the amount of secretion

00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:41.370
by determining which way
you, the hypothalamus,

00:47:41.370 --> 00:47:42.680
turf the signals.

00:47:42.680 --> 00:47:44.560
Are you aiming for these types?

00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:46.400
Or are you aiming
for these types?

00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:49.740
More regulation that
way-- how does that work?

00:47:49.740 --> 00:47:54.070
What it has to be is all sorts
of communication going on

00:47:54.070 --> 00:47:56.610
amongst the various
pituitary cells.

00:47:56.610 --> 00:47:59.810
So the pituitary is not
just sitting there passively

00:47:59.810 --> 00:48:02.580
responding to whatever the
hypothalamus is saying.

00:48:02.580 --> 00:48:06.190
Instead, there's all this local
regulatory stuff happening.

00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:11.570
One additional thing
that was asked-- so

00:48:11.570 --> 00:48:14.020
in this case, what
we go back to is

00:48:14.020 --> 00:48:17.630
that business of the
more glucocorticoids

00:48:17.630 --> 00:48:23.780
in the bloodstream in this
boring, level-sensitive domain

00:48:23.780 --> 00:48:26.140
of you're just measuring
how much of the stuff

00:48:26.140 --> 00:48:28.160
there is in the
bloodstream, you're

00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:30.790
measuring there--
some part of the brain

00:48:30.790 --> 00:48:33.070
is measuring the levels
of glucocorticoids.

00:48:33.070 --> 00:48:34.690
And the part is actually known.

00:48:34.690 --> 00:48:36.850
It's measuring there,
and it has its rule.

00:48:36.850 --> 00:48:39.310
Once glucocorticoid
levels get this high,

00:48:39.310 --> 00:48:44.360
I will send an an inhibitory
signal to those CRH neurons.

00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:48.390
And as a result, they'll
secrete less CRH.

00:48:48.390 --> 00:48:50.590
And that turns off
the stress response.

00:48:50.590 --> 00:48:53.010
The more glucocorticoids
in the bloodstream,

00:48:53.010 --> 00:48:54.940
the more of a negative
feedback signal.

00:48:54.940 --> 00:48:58.980
What the person brought up was
the very astute observation

00:48:58.980 --> 00:49:01.050
that wait, what about
all those other types

00:49:01.050 --> 00:49:03.320
up there-- oxytocin,
vasopressin, epinephrine?

00:49:03.320 --> 00:49:07.100
What that means is
there are sensors

00:49:07.100 --> 00:49:10.110
that are talking to each
one of those types there.

00:49:10.110 --> 00:49:11.830
And the brain at
any given point,

00:49:11.830 --> 00:49:13.780
depending on the
stressor, is saying,

00:49:13.780 --> 00:49:17.030
well, we want this
much CRH, and we

00:49:17.030 --> 00:49:19.850
want this much of vasopressin
and this much oxytocin.

00:49:19.850 --> 00:49:21.940
And we're going to
determine it all

00:49:21.940 --> 00:49:25.890
by measuring the level and the
shape of glucocorticoid levels

00:49:25.890 --> 00:49:28.670
in the bloodstream, so that
there's feedback going on--

00:49:28.670 --> 00:49:32.200
not just onto the CRH neurons,
but to all those other types

00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:36.810
of neurons as well-- incredibly
messy and complicated,

00:49:36.810 --> 00:49:39.240
nonetheless very elegant.

00:49:39.240 --> 00:49:42.260
Pushing on-- next
version of complications.

00:49:42.260 --> 00:49:44.830
Now what we've got
is another feature

00:49:44.830 --> 00:49:47.290
of how receptors go
about their business.

00:49:47.290 --> 00:49:50.740
This general principle
doesn't apply all the time.

00:49:50.740 --> 00:49:55.000
But in general, more of
a ligand for a receptor.

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.610
A ligand, for folks
not familiar with this,

00:49:57.610 --> 00:50:01.980
a neurotransmitter is a
ligand for a neurotransmitter

00:50:01.980 --> 00:50:02.920
receptor.

00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:06.100
A hormone is a ligand
for a hormone receptor.

00:50:06.100 --> 00:50:10.190
The ligand is whatever the
receptor normally binds.

00:50:10.190 --> 00:50:13.060
So this general-- not
universal, but general-- rule

00:50:13.060 --> 00:50:16.610
of the higher the ligand
levels, the more likely

00:50:16.610 --> 00:50:20.070
you are to trigger this
compensatory down-regulation

00:50:20.070 --> 00:50:21.800
to lower the
levels, all of that.

00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:25.430
Here's another level of
regulation that can go on.

00:50:25.430 --> 00:50:28.100
So you've got these receptors.

00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:31.140
They are complicated,
because their job

00:50:31.140 --> 00:50:36.910
is to bind their ligand and
to then do something or other.

00:50:36.910 --> 00:50:38.830
And the cell, as
a result, opens up

00:50:38.830 --> 00:50:42.330
some channel that allows
a change in excitability

00:50:42.330 --> 00:50:43.750
in the neuron,
that sort of thing.

00:50:43.750 --> 00:50:46.610
These receptors tend
to be very complicated.

00:50:46.610 --> 00:50:50.980
And what you wind up seeing is,
in lots of realms of receptors

00:50:50.980 --> 00:50:53.930
for different types of hormones,
neurotransmitters, et cetera,

00:50:53.930 --> 00:50:56.860
you actually have
the receptor made up

00:50:56.860 --> 00:50:59.570
of a number of
different proteins,

00:50:59.570 --> 00:51:02.510
of a complex of proteins.

00:51:02.510 --> 00:51:19.080
So that for example, here
we have a receptor that's

00:51:19.080 --> 00:51:25.650
binding a ligand that looks like
that, just like your premolars.

00:51:25.650 --> 00:51:27.920
And what you have
there is, it's got

00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:30.460
to come up with a complementary
shape and lock and key,

00:51:30.460 --> 00:51:31.680
blah, blah, all of that.

00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:34.690
And in this particular
case, this receptor complex

00:51:34.690 --> 00:51:37.520
is made up of three
different proteins that

00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:40.820
are needed to pull this off--
three different proteins, three

00:51:40.820 --> 00:51:43.150
different genes--
a receptor being

00:51:43.150 --> 00:51:45.810
coded for by multiple genes.

00:51:45.810 --> 00:51:49.120
When you get the more
fancy, complicated receptors

00:51:49.120 --> 00:51:54.270
they tend to be complexes of
more than one protein forming

00:51:54.270 --> 00:51:56.130
this pattern.

00:51:56.130 --> 00:51:58.830
So you've got multiple genes.

00:51:58.830 --> 00:51:59.762
That's interesting.

00:51:59.762 --> 00:52:01.720
And of course, we're off
and running with that.

00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:03.850
What that means,
then, is you've got

00:52:03.850 --> 00:52:06.840
the potential for
variation, different flavors

00:52:06.840 --> 00:52:09.370
of the different genes,
more different ways

00:52:09.370 --> 00:52:10.740
that this could appear.

00:52:10.740 --> 00:52:13.720
There's two different
variants on this gene.

00:52:13.720 --> 00:52:15.830
There's 17 on this one.

00:52:15.830 --> 00:52:18.320
And you just do the
combinatorial stuff.

00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:20.680
And thus, you've
got a huge number

00:52:20.680 --> 00:52:24.600
of ways of generating different
versions of that same receptor,

00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:27.800
which, of course, will work a
little bit better, or a little

00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:32.130
slower, or a little whatever--
variation like that.

00:52:32.130 --> 00:52:35.180
Next complexity that
you get with receptors--

00:52:35.180 --> 00:52:37.570
you can have a
receptor that's made up

00:52:37.570 --> 00:52:39.570
of three different proteins.

00:52:39.570 --> 00:52:43.040
And there's four
different genes that

00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:46.880
make proteins that
can help construct

00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:48.560
one of these receptors.

00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:54.520
So you can make a receptor out
of proteins 1, 2, 3, or 1, 2,

00:52:54.520 --> 00:52:57.640
4, or 1, 3, 4, or
off you go with that.

00:52:57.640 --> 00:53:01.370
Or you can make a receptor out
of three copies of number one,

00:53:01.370 --> 00:53:05.080
or two copies of number two
and one copy of number four.

00:53:05.080 --> 00:53:09.940
There's these possibilities of
all these different subunits

00:53:09.940 --> 00:53:13.660
being different--
variability that way.

00:53:13.660 --> 00:53:16.450
So another realm
of regulation is

00:53:16.450 --> 00:53:22.820
when cells change the
subunits on their receptors,

00:53:22.820 --> 00:53:27.570
when cells will cause,
say, degradation of-- OK,

00:53:27.570 --> 00:53:35.650
so here we've got this
three-protein receptor complex.

00:53:35.650 --> 00:53:37.250
And there's four
different proteins

00:53:37.250 --> 00:53:38.950
that potentially plug into it.

00:53:38.950 --> 00:53:41.920
And this version has one
copy of A, one copy of B,

00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:44.920
and one copy of C.
Something may happen

00:53:44.920 --> 00:53:49.720
which will cause the neuron
to degrade the copies of B

00:53:49.720 --> 00:53:53.390
and replace it with
D, or replace it

00:53:53.390 --> 00:53:57.670
with another copy of A, replace
all this combinatorial stuff,

00:53:57.670 --> 00:54:01.390
and thus change a little
bit how well the receptor is

00:54:01.390 --> 00:54:02.720
doing its job.

00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:06.470
And you see these subunit
changes all over the place.

00:54:06.470 --> 00:54:10.250
One domain, in terms of the
neurobiology neurotransmitter

00:54:10.250 --> 00:54:13.730
stuff-- aspects of
glutamate receptors--

00:54:13.730 --> 00:54:16.750
you guys heard something about
that the other day-- glutamate

00:54:16.750 --> 00:54:18.610
receptor's essential
for learning,

00:54:18.610 --> 00:54:21.940
very complicated receptors,
insanely complicated.

00:54:21.940 --> 00:54:24.530
Part of what learning
appears to be about

00:54:24.530 --> 00:54:27.400
is not only
increasing the number

00:54:27.400 --> 00:54:31.250
of copies of a certain
type of glutamate receptor,

00:54:31.250 --> 00:54:34.240
but changing the
subunit composition,

00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:37.990
and making for a more
responsive, more excitable

00:54:37.990 --> 00:54:41.010
version of that receptor.

00:54:41.010 --> 00:54:43.930
There's other realms with a
different type of receptor

00:54:43.930 --> 00:54:47.180
where, in fact, you've got
an abnormal subunit that's

00:54:47.180 --> 00:54:48.550
not supposed to be there.

00:54:48.550 --> 00:54:50.550
And as a result,
this now produces

00:54:50.550 --> 00:54:54.360
a cell that is prone
towards insanely high levels

00:54:54.360 --> 00:54:55.600
of excitation.

00:54:55.600 --> 00:54:58.850
This is a congenital reason
for causing epilepsy.

00:54:58.850 --> 00:55:02.180
This is one of the genetic
forms of epilepsy, where you've

00:55:02.180 --> 00:55:07.210
got the wrong subunit winding
up in another neurotransmitter

00:55:07.210 --> 00:55:08.190
and its receptor.

00:55:08.190 --> 00:55:12.760
All we're seeing here is lots
of room for more regulation

00:55:12.760 --> 00:55:16.880
here, mixing and matching,
changing the subunit stuff.

00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:20.540
That's how you begin to do
that critical principle.

00:55:20.540 --> 00:55:23.840
Remember, all the stuff
from the basic functioning,

00:55:23.840 --> 00:55:25.890
the flow of information
from the dendrites

00:55:25.890 --> 00:55:28.460
to the axon hillock--
what's that all about?

00:55:28.460 --> 00:55:31.950
No single dendritic input is
enough to trigger an action

00:55:31.950 --> 00:55:32.470
potential.

00:55:32.470 --> 00:55:35.180
Instead, you have to have enough
of them, enough summation,

00:55:35.180 --> 00:55:39.680
to reach the threshold that the
axon hillock has to initiate

00:55:39.680 --> 00:55:41.040
the action potential.

00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:44.090
And the threshold
could change over time.

00:55:44.090 --> 00:55:45.610
Translate that into this.

00:55:45.610 --> 00:55:49.970
What does it mean when an axon
hillock's threshold is changed?

00:55:49.970 --> 00:55:53.160
Those critical first channels
that open up-- you've

00:55:53.160 --> 00:55:55.690
changed the subunit composition.

00:55:55.690 --> 00:55:58.310
So that is a theme all
throughout this world

00:55:58.310 --> 00:56:02.540
of receptorology and channels
that open and close and stuff,

00:56:02.540 --> 00:56:06.720
where cells can change which
are the pieces that make it up,

00:56:06.720 --> 00:56:09.610
and change the
properties subtly.

00:56:09.610 --> 00:56:13.260
Similar theme that could
come through with hormone

00:56:13.260 --> 00:56:15.000
receptors-- same exact deal.

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:18.350
A whole bunch of them are
multi-protein complexes--

00:56:18.350 --> 00:56:20.330
exact same story.

00:56:20.330 --> 00:56:23.060
You can see something a
little different when you

00:56:23.060 --> 00:56:25.147
have steroid hormone receptors.

00:56:28.360 --> 00:56:30.650
And as we saw the
other week, remember,

00:56:30.650 --> 00:56:34.910
it's got two domains-- one
which binds the hormone--

00:56:34.910 --> 00:56:38.110
glucocorticoid, just to pick
a random steroid or estrogen,

00:56:38.110 --> 00:56:42.850
progesterone, or whatever-- and
one that binds to the promoter

00:56:42.850 --> 00:56:44.230
element in the DNA.

00:56:44.230 --> 00:56:46.020
We've got our if/then clause.

00:56:46.020 --> 00:56:49.460
If and only if this
steroid hormone shows up,

00:56:49.460 --> 00:56:52.890
then you go and you
activate that gene--

00:56:52.890 --> 00:56:54.030
our conditional clause.

00:56:54.030 --> 00:56:55.940
But what turns
out to be the case

00:56:55.940 --> 00:57:00.640
is all sorts of steroid
hormone receptors

00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:04.680
have various other proteins
that they bind there.

00:57:04.680 --> 00:57:07.660
Co-factors is the
term given for it.

00:57:07.660 --> 00:57:12.610
And you get different arrays
of co-factors in different cell

00:57:12.610 --> 00:57:13.510
types.

00:57:13.510 --> 00:57:16.630
And as a result, when
you activate this,

00:57:16.630 --> 00:57:19.470
it will do different things
in different cell types--

00:57:19.470 --> 00:57:21.690
cell-type specific coding.

00:57:21.690 --> 00:57:24.310
And of course, the
exact same theme

00:57:24.310 --> 00:57:27.190
here-- under some
circumstances, cells

00:57:27.190 --> 00:57:30.110
will change which
cofactors they have

00:57:30.110 --> 00:57:32.150
holding onto those receptors.

00:57:32.150 --> 00:57:35.380
So what we see here are
these additional layers

00:57:35.380 --> 00:57:38.350
of potential regulation.

00:57:38.350 --> 00:57:42.410
More complexities--
next one-- now

00:57:42.410 --> 00:57:45.260
we've hurdled past the
notion of only one type

00:57:45.260 --> 00:57:47.190
of neurotransmitter per neuron.

00:57:47.190 --> 00:57:50.530
We have hurdled past the
notion of the same action

00:57:50.530 --> 00:57:53.970
potential will be manifest in
every single axon terminal.

00:57:53.970 --> 00:57:57.160
Now we see all sorts of
additional information built

00:57:57.160 --> 00:58:00.190
around changing the
number of receptors,

00:58:00.190 --> 00:58:04.130
changing the composition of
them, regulating those ways.

00:58:04.130 --> 00:58:07.300
One additional complication
here with these receptors,

00:58:07.300 --> 00:58:11.910
which is a lot of them can
bind more than one thing,

00:58:11.910 --> 00:58:14.860
can bind more than one ligand.

00:58:14.860 --> 00:58:18.930
And we see an amazing example
of this at the neurotransmitter

00:58:18.930 --> 00:58:20.930
end of the world.

00:58:20.930 --> 00:58:23.410
You guys heard about the
neurotransmitter GABA.

00:58:23.410 --> 00:58:28.660
GABA is the main inhibitory
neurotransmitter in the brain.

00:58:28.660 --> 00:58:30.740
It is the workhorse
for doing that.

00:58:30.740 --> 00:58:35.400
The GABA receptor-- no
surprise-- binds GABA.

00:58:35.400 --> 00:58:37.210
Its ligand is GABA.

00:58:37.210 --> 00:58:39.710
It is found on the
dendritic spines

00:58:39.710 --> 00:58:42.920
of GABA-responsive neurons.

00:58:42.920 --> 00:58:44.720
And the neurons
just upstream of it

00:58:44.720 --> 00:58:48.560
will release GABA in response
to its action potential,

00:58:48.560 --> 00:58:50.020
and just goes about its thing.

00:58:50.020 --> 00:58:51.920
So what does the
GABA receptor do?

00:58:51.920 --> 00:58:53.050
It binds GABA.

00:58:53.050 --> 00:58:55.230
And when it binds GABA,
something or other

00:58:55.230 --> 00:58:59.590
happens so that this neuron
becomes less excitable.

00:58:59.590 --> 00:59:02.140
It's an inhibitory
neurotransmitter.

00:59:02.140 --> 00:59:06.550
It turns out the GABA receptor
is insanely complicated.

00:59:06.550 --> 00:59:09.180
It is, instead, a
receptor complex

00:59:09.180 --> 00:59:11.110
of a whole bunch of
different proteins.

00:59:11.110 --> 00:59:13.530
And what the GABA
receptor does is

00:59:13.530 --> 00:59:16.450
it binds some other
things as well--

00:59:16.450 --> 00:59:20.100
three different classes, all
of which are very interesting.

00:59:20.100 --> 00:59:23.570
The first class of additional
things that it binds

00:59:23.570 --> 00:59:27.980
are things called
major tranquilizers.

00:59:27.980 --> 00:59:30.510
What does the GABA complex bind?

00:59:30.510 --> 00:59:36.870
And here we have
our GABA receptor.

00:59:36.870 --> 00:59:38.550
And GABA fits right in there.

00:59:38.550 --> 00:59:40.960
And it turns out the
GABA receptor also

00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:45.810
has another binding site
here for major tranquilizers.

00:59:45.810 --> 00:59:47.650
What are major tranquilizers?

00:59:47.650 --> 00:59:52.970
Barbiturates-- this is how
barbiturates work in the brain.

00:59:52.970 --> 00:59:55.400
There are not
barbiturate receptors.

00:59:55.400 --> 00:59:57.860
They bind to the GABA receptor.

00:59:57.860 --> 01:00:00.310
There is a side complex on it.

01:00:00.310 --> 01:00:03.470
There is a minor binding
site on the GABA receptor

01:00:03.470 --> 01:00:05.470
for barbiturates.

01:00:05.470 --> 01:00:09.860
OK, so GABA, inhibitory
neurotransmitter-- when

01:00:09.860 --> 01:00:13.240
barbiturates are around, does
that increase or decrease

01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:14.000
GABA signaling?

01:00:17.260 --> 01:00:20.620
OK, who says increase?

01:00:20.620 --> 01:00:23.170
Who says decrease?

01:00:23.170 --> 01:00:24.910
Who says, what?

01:00:24.910 --> 01:00:27.030
OK, me, too.

01:00:27.030 --> 01:00:30.250
I wasn't listening either.

01:00:30.250 --> 01:00:32.130
I'll tell you, lurking
around in the back

01:00:32.130 --> 01:00:34.360
during those TA's
lectures, you really

01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:37.050
do get a sense of what
interesting, non-academic

01:00:37.050 --> 01:00:39.790
things are going on
people's computer screens.

01:00:39.790 --> 01:00:43.050
But I digress.

01:00:43.050 --> 01:00:48.080
So what barbiturates do is they
make GABA more inhibitory--

01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:50.150
inhibitory enough
that you keel over.

01:00:50.150 --> 01:00:52.610
And now they can slice
you open for surgery.

01:00:52.610 --> 01:00:55.640
This is how one of the main
classes of surgical anesthetics

01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:56.570
work.

01:00:56.570 --> 01:00:59.380
Then there is
another binding site

01:00:59.380 --> 01:01:01.380
on the GABA receptor complex.

01:01:01.380 --> 01:01:05.420
And what that does is it
binds the minor tranquilizers.

01:01:05.420 --> 01:01:06.380
And what are those?

01:01:06.380 --> 01:01:08.910
We've heard about those
a bunch of times already.

01:01:08.910 --> 01:01:13.680
Those are the benzodiazepine,
the valium, and the librium.

01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:15.560
And they work there as well.

01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:17.490
And we've already
heard about how

01:01:17.490 --> 01:01:20.420
anxiety disorders
in some rodent lines

01:01:20.420 --> 01:01:22.130
are related to
different versions

01:01:22.130 --> 01:01:25.130
of the gene for the
benzodiazepine receptor.

01:01:25.130 --> 01:01:27.360
We've just defined
what that gene is.

01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:31.470
That gene codes for one of the
subunits of this massive GABA

01:01:31.470 --> 01:01:32.440
complex.

01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:36.270
So there's another domain there
that binds benzodiazepines--

01:01:36.270 --> 01:01:37.890
the minor tranquilizers.

01:01:37.890 --> 01:01:39.670
What do they do?

01:01:39.670 --> 01:01:42.700
They increase the force
of GABA signaling as well?

01:01:42.700 --> 01:01:45.550
Do they do it as much as
the major tranquilizers?

01:01:45.550 --> 01:01:47.830
Of course it's not the case,
because you wouldn't call

01:01:47.830 --> 01:01:49.620
them minor tranquilizers then.

01:01:49.620 --> 01:01:53.880
These guys potentiate GABA
signaling a moderate amount.

01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:57.200
These guys potentiate
it enormously.

01:01:57.200 --> 01:02:01.940
So now we have these additional
factors binding to these GABA

01:02:01.940 --> 01:02:02.840
receptors.

01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:05.640
A third class-- and
this is, in lots of ways

01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:07.620
the most interesting
one of all, which

01:02:07.620 --> 01:02:10.060
is an additional
binding site there.

01:02:10.060 --> 01:02:14.940
That responds to a hormone
or a derivative of a hormone.

01:02:14.940 --> 01:02:16.540
What is it responding to?

01:02:16.540 --> 01:02:19.780
Derivatives of progesterone.

01:02:19.780 --> 01:02:25.820
Progesterone has a binding
site on the GABA receptor.

01:02:25.820 --> 01:02:28.100
Progesterone is a
steroid hormone.

01:02:28.100 --> 01:02:30.110
It's normally doing
its thing here.

01:02:30.110 --> 01:02:34.820
And now we have, instead, having
a minor slot there on the side

01:02:34.820 --> 01:02:36.950
there that responds
to progesterone.

01:02:36.950 --> 01:02:39.160
What does progesterone do?

01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:42.690
It also potentiates
the effects of GABA.

01:02:42.690 --> 01:02:44.820
What's that about?

01:02:44.820 --> 01:02:48.470
Two implications--
one is, in the 1950s,

01:02:48.470 --> 01:02:51.470
one of the most common
surgical anesthetics used

01:02:51.470 --> 01:02:54.090
was a drug called
Althesin, and it was

01:02:54.090 --> 01:02:56.500
a derivative of progesterone.

01:02:56.500 --> 01:02:59.090
People in the '50s
would be anesthetized

01:02:59.090 --> 01:03:02.230
with this supposedly
reproductive steroid hormone,

01:03:02.230 --> 01:03:06.610
because it has this effect
on the then undiscovered GABA

01:03:06.610 --> 01:03:07.510
receptor.

01:03:07.510 --> 01:03:11.140
It potentiates inhibitory
GABA signaling.

01:03:11.140 --> 01:03:12.860
That's weird.

01:03:12.860 --> 01:03:16.100
So progesterone--
clearly, this relationship

01:03:16.100 --> 01:03:18.360
did not evolve so that
people could do surgery

01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:21.030
on people who didn't want
to get major tranquilizers,

01:03:21.030 --> 01:03:23.180
and instead deal with
the progesterone route.

01:03:23.180 --> 01:03:24.940
Where is this relevant?

01:03:24.940 --> 01:03:29.540
It seems to have something to
do with some of the mood shifts

01:03:29.540 --> 01:03:32.010
over the course of the
reproductive cycle.

01:03:32.010 --> 01:03:34.380
There are reasons, and
pretty good evidence

01:03:34.380 --> 01:03:37.680
in lots of domains, where
perimenstrual syndrome--

01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:39.670
pre-menstrual
syndrome, PMS-- which

01:03:39.670 --> 01:03:41.850
is more accurately
called perimenstrual--

01:03:41.850 --> 01:03:43.190
both before and after.

01:03:43.190 --> 01:03:46.120
What that involves,
clearly in some women,

01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:49.350
is a shortage of
progesterone having

01:03:49.350 --> 01:03:53.610
some of these minor
tranquilizing effects

01:03:53.610 --> 01:03:56.640
by way of the GABA
receptor complex.

01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:59.760
So this is incredibly
complicated stuff

01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:03.020
going on here, as you can see.

01:04:03.020 --> 01:04:06.510
Final domain-- final
interesting elaboration,

01:04:06.510 --> 01:04:10.730
which is now bringing in a
whole additional concept--

01:04:10.730 --> 01:04:13.840
and deserves a board
all of its own.

01:04:19.030 --> 01:04:22.860
So here we have
circular neurons.

01:04:22.860 --> 01:04:26.040
And what we've got is, this is
the neuron we're interested in.

01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:27.260
What's it up to?

01:04:27.260 --> 01:04:30.750
And this is neuron
A. And just to force

01:04:30.750 --> 01:04:33.060
some cognitive flexibility,
this is neuron B,

01:04:33.060 --> 01:04:34.460
going in the wrong direction.

01:04:34.460 --> 01:04:39.690
So we've got neuron B releases
an excitatory neurotransmitter,

01:04:39.690 --> 01:04:43.990
and thus, excites A. OK,
this is not earth shattering.

01:04:43.990 --> 01:04:47.440
It's probably releasing,
say, glutamate for example.

01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:51.090
So remember GABA-- that
inhibitory neurotransmitter

01:04:51.090 --> 01:04:52.340
we just heard about.

01:04:52.340 --> 01:04:55.610
So GABA does inhibitory stuff.

01:04:55.610 --> 01:04:59.030
So maybe there is a GABA neuron
here sending its projection,

01:04:59.030 --> 01:05:00.590
and this one is inhibitory.

01:05:00.590 --> 01:05:03.170
Notice what we've done by
turning neurons into spheres.

01:05:03.170 --> 01:05:05.580
We've lost all the
little dendritic spines.

01:05:05.580 --> 01:05:09.390
So translate that into back to
what it actually looks like.

01:05:09.390 --> 01:05:10.870
This is just schematic.

01:05:10.870 --> 01:05:12.510
So we've got two inputs.

01:05:12.510 --> 01:05:15.900
We've got an excitatory
input by way of glutamate.

01:05:15.900 --> 01:05:18.020
We have an inhibitory
one with GABA.

01:05:18.020 --> 01:05:19.260
What does that imply?

01:05:19.260 --> 01:05:23.240
Dendritic spines in this
neuron contain both receptors

01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:25.680
for glutamate and
receptors for GABA.

01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:27.620
That would be straightforward.

01:05:27.620 --> 01:05:30.430
That would be simple,
if that's how it works.

01:05:30.430 --> 01:05:32.200
That's not what you see.

01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:37.120
Instead, GABA neurons
never send a projection

01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:39.730
onto what would
be neuron A. What

01:05:39.730 --> 01:05:47.060
they do is they send a
projection onto neuron B.

01:05:47.060 --> 01:05:49.650
What's that about?

01:05:49.650 --> 01:05:53.000
What's that about is
what GABA is doing

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:56.770
is making this neuron
less excitable.

01:05:56.770 --> 01:05:59.270
It's working as an
inhibitory neurotransmitter.

01:05:59.270 --> 01:06:01.500
It's making this
neuron less excitable.

01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:03.980
What's happening
here-- this neuron

01:06:03.980 --> 01:06:06.680
has just started
an action potential

01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:08.800
that's coming down the axon.

01:06:08.800 --> 01:06:11.990
And thanks to a heavy
GABA signal coming out,

01:06:11.990 --> 01:06:13.760
it silences it.

01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:17.970
It never gets to the end, and
dumps the neurotransmitter.

01:06:17.970 --> 01:06:20.140
This is totally weird.

01:06:20.140 --> 01:06:22.730
This is completely different
from all the wiring

01:06:22.730 --> 01:06:23.800
you've seen already.

01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:25.450
What's bizarre about it?

01:06:25.450 --> 01:06:28.930
Number one, this is a
neuron forming synapses

01:06:28.930 --> 01:06:31.420
not on the dendrites
of this neuron.

01:06:31.420 --> 01:06:34.490
It's forming a synapse
on the axon of this.

01:06:34.490 --> 01:06:39.680
And thus, we have what is
termed an axoaxonic synapse.

01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:41.970
What does that also imply?

01:06:41.970 --> 01:06:47.680
That there have to be GABA
receptors sitting there

01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:49.670
at the pre-synaptic
end-- just as

01:06:49.670 --> 01:06:52.530
bizarre as the
pre-synaptic autoreceptors.

01:06:52.530 --> 01:06:54.580
Remember, those are for
measuring the amount

01:06:54.580 --> 01:06:56.240
of release-- bookkeeping stuff.

01:06:56.240 --> 01:06:58.820
But here, this is
perfectly conventional

01:06:58.820 --> 01:07:01.010
neuronal responding
to a neurotransmitter,

01:07:01.010 --> 01:07:03.970
but coming at the
completely wrong end

01:07:03.970 --> 01:07:07.910
with this weird
axoaxonic projection.

01:07:07.910 --> 01:07:12.020
But what's most important here
is seeing this implication.

01:07:12.020 --> 01:07:15.820
So what is it that
this neuron does to A?

01:07:15.820 --> 01:07:20.525
What does this GABA neuron
do to the excitability of A?

01:07:20.525 --> 01:07:24.310
And the answer is,
it does nothing.

01:07:24.310 --> 01:07:28.120
It has no effect on
the excitability of A.

01:07:28.120 --> 01:07:33.790
What this GABA neuron does is
alter the ability of neuron B

01:07:33.790 --> 01:07:37.850
to do something
to A. This neuron

01:07:37.850 --> 01:07:40.030
has no direct effect here.

01:07:40.030 --> 01:07:45.950
What it does is it modulates
the activity of this neuron.

01:07:45.950 --> 01:07:49.880
And thus, you have a whole new
class of type of communication.

01:07:49.880 --> 01:07:52.920
Technically, rather than
working as a neurotransmitter,

01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:54.960
it would be termed
GABA typically

01:07:54.960 --> 01:08:00.150
serves a neuromodulatory
role in the nervous system.

01:08:00.150 --> 01:08:03.060
And that's this wonderful
conditional clause

01:08:03.060 --> 01:08:05.920
yet again-- yet
another if/then clause.

01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:09.930
GABA decreases
excitability if and only

01:08:09.930 --> 01:08:14.650
if this neuron is trying to
send an excitatory signal.

01:08:14.650 --> 01:08:18.910
All that GABA does is snuff
out an excitatory signal

01:08:18.910 --> 01:08:22.810
coming down here-- so
modulation in that regard.

01:08:22.810 --> 01:08:26.590
We've already seen another
example of that writ small.

01:08:26.590 --> 01:08:29.210
Back to the GABA complex here.

01:08:29.210 --> 01:08:34.000
What do the major
tranquilizers do there?

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:35.810
What do barbiturates do?

01:08:35.810 --> 01:08:41.160
They do not make this
neuron less excitable.

01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:47.370
What they do is, if and only
if there is GABA coming in,

01:08:47.370 --> 01:08:50.000
it makes the GABA
work even better.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:54.189
The tranquilizers do
not inhibit the neuron.

01:08:54.189 --> 01:08:57.520
The tranquilizers
modulate, potentiate,

01:08:57.520 --> 01:08:59.899
the activity of GABA.

01:08:59.899 --> 01:09:02.620
The minor tranquilizers the
same thing, the progesterone

01:09:02.620 --> 01:09:03.510
the same thing.

01:09:03.510 --> 01:09:05.930
So this is a different
level of this concept

01:09:05.930 --> 01:09:09.350
of neuromodulation--
if/then clauses

01:09:09.350 --> 01:09:11.210
all over the place here.

01:09:11.210 --> 01:09:14.979
So if and only if GABA
is doing its thing,

01:09:14.979 --> 01:09:18.580
any of these minor ligands
will potentiate it.

01:09:18.580 --> 01:09:23.500
If and only if this neuron
is trying to stimulate here,

01:09:23.500 --> 01:09:27.550
GABA will have an inhibitory
effect on the whole system.

01:09:27.550 --> 01:09:31.450
So you see lots and lots
of this modulatory stuff.

01:09:31.450 --> 01:09:35.430
Final example, seeing the
same principle of modulation,

01:09:35.430 --> 01:09:37.159
now occurring in an
endocrine system.

01:09:58.570 --> 01:10:02.380
OK, so now we're measuring
the amount of ACTH coming out

01:10:02.380 --> 01:10:05.090
of the pituitary,
and back to that deal

01:10:05.090 --> 01:10:07.010
that we've got all
these different ways

01:10:07.010 --> 01:10:10.560
in which the brain can
cause the release of ACTH.

01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:13.390
And starting off, we saw CRH.

01:10:13.390 --> 01:10:17.920
So suppose you throw in some
CRH on top of the pituitary

01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:19.814
there, inject it
into the circulation.

01:10:19.814 --> 01:10:23.220
And this much ACTH comes out.

01:10:23.220 --> 01:10:25.220
OK, that's good.

01:10:25.220 --> 01:10:29.670
Now, instead of putting on
CRH, you put in both CRH

01:10:29.670 --> 01:10:32.560
and vasopressin-- a
second one of those.

01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:34.380
And what do you see?

01:10:34.380 --> 01:10:36.380
That's perfectly logical.

01:10:36.380 --> 01:10:40.220
You've got two things
driving ACTH secretion.

01:10:40.220 --> 01:10:44.180
Now you put on vasopressin
just by itself.

01:10:44.180 --> 01:10:47.730
And what you get is this.

01:10:47.730 --> 01:10:51.100
You get no secretion.

01:10:51.100 --> 01:10:55.780
Does vasopressin stimulate
the release of ACTH?

01:10:55.780 --> 01:10:57.010
No, it doesn't.

01:10:57.010 --> 01:11:00.310
What vasopressin does
is it potentiates

01:11:00.310 --> 01:11:02.690
the activity of CRH.

01:11:02.690 --> 01:11:06.230
It modulates CRH's activity.

01:11:06.230 --> 01:11:08.990
Vasopressin does
nothing by itself.

01:11:08.990 --> 01:11:12.810
If and only if
there is CRH getting

01:11:12.810 --> 01:11:15.910
to those pituitary
cells, then vasopressin

01:11:15.910 --> 01:11:17.950
will potentiate its actions.

01:11:17.950 --> 01:11:20.940
All of those other
releasors-- the vasopressin,

01:11:20.940 --> 01:11:24.240
the oxytocin, epinephrine,
norepinephrine-- none of them

01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:26.640
are direct releasors
on their own.

01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:31.490
They all are modulating,
potentiating CRH's effects.

01:11:31.490 --> 01:11:34.370
So what we've got here
is this enormous realm

01:11:34.370 --> 01:11:37.050
of complexity of
all of these if/then

01:11:37.050 --> 01:11:40.720
clauses, various hormones
that are not directly

01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:43.630
causing anything,
neurotransmitters that are not

01:11:43.630 --> 01:11:46.870
directly causing anything,
ligands for receptors

01:11:46.870 --> 01:11:48.090
that are not, either.

01:11:48.090 --> 01:11:50.480
What they're all
doing is, if and only

01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:54.584
if something else is happening,
something else is going on,

01:11:54.584 --> 01:11:56.000
there's an additional
ligand, they

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:59.830
do their thing-- lots and lots
of these conditional clauses.

01:11:59.830 --> 01:12:01.420
More complexity there.

01:12:01.420 --> 01:12:04.970
OK, so what does all of
this get us here at the end?

01:12:04.970 --> 01:12:08.610
Obvious-- lots of
individual variability,

01:12:08.610 --> 01:12:11.370
lots of ways in which
these systems are changing

01:12:11.370 --> 01:12:15.790
in response to experience, all
that subunit changing business.

01:12:15.790 --> 01:12:19.400
Something happens and you
get rid of one subunit.

01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:21.230
Replace it with another,
and you've changed

01:12:21.230 --> 01:12:23.240
the excitability of the system.

01:12:23.240 --> 01:12:27.380
All sorts of over and over
conditional if/then clauses,

01:12:27.380 --> 01:12:30.110
tremendous increase
in the complexity.

01:12:30.110 --> 01:12:32.770
These themes will come
through again and again

01:12:32.770 --> 01:12:35.030
in the second half
of the course.

01:12:35.030 --> 01:12:36.630
So let's stop at this point.

01:12:36.630 --> 01:12:39.270
Are there any questions, since
this was a major download?

01:12:39.270 --> 01:12:40.620
Check the extended notes.

01:12:40.620 --> 01:12:42.590
Are the extended
notes posted yet?

01:12:42.590 --> 01:12:43.230
Not yet.

01:12:43.230 --> 01:12:45.740
They will be some time or other.

01:12:45.740 --> 01:12:47.485
OK, any questions?

01:12:52.460 --> 01:12:56.260
OK, so go read those notes
as soon as they're up.
