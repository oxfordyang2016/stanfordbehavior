[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.982 --> 00:00:05.815
Stanford University.

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.030
Something incredibly cool I
just found out about yesterday,

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.910
which, oh, I wish I had
known about two days ago,

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.020
but still, it's useful.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.290
You remember those Siberian
foxes and that amazing thing?

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:30.240
You breed them for tameness,
purely on a behavioral trait,

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.800
and come back 30
generations later,

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.490
and they look like puppies.

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.630
They have the short muzzles,
and the big roundy eyes,

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:39.750
and the cute ears, and
they wag their tails

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.950
and all of that, punchline
there being, number one,

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.700
evolution can move really fast.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.360
Number two in some
interesting, mysterious way,

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.030
if you are selecting for
certain behavioral traits--

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.250
in this case, one where you
like being around humans

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.860
and are all cuddly with
them-- what you're also going

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.810
to select for are a
whole bunch of traits

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.530
that are associated with
baby wolves in terms

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:04.940
of physical appearance.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.920
Turns out, there's a flip side
of this going on right now

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.160
with what are known as metro
dogs, which are dogs that live

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.930
in the subway system in Moscow.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.320
And I don't know, but
they live in there,

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.120
and a whole deal was made out
of the number of them which

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.610
get on subways and know
which stops they're going to.

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.670
And there's an entire
website devoted

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.740
to metro dogs, which
are in Russian,

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.550
but it has lots
of nice pictures.

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.050
But what they're seeing
there is that these

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.050
are dogs who, essentially,
have been feral

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.670
and in feral packs for
decades and decades.

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.290
And what have they been
being selected for?

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.980
Being able to scrounge,
being, in fact, quite scared

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.880
of humans, a lot of the
time staying far from them

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.880
whenever possible because
they are raiding garbage

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.270
cans, who knows what.

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.290
And what they're seeing
in the metro dogs

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.620
is about 30 generations
into it now,

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.040
their tails are looking
more like the tails

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.430
you see on wolves.

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.500
Their muzzles are
getting longer.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.200
Their coat patterns
are beginning

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.980
to get less fancy and
distinctive from all

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:09.690
the different strains of dogs.

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.640
These guys are being selected
for the exact same traits that

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.120
went into being wolves.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.200
It's a really interesting
demonstration.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.190
Again, these guys are not
surviving because they've

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.740
got a different-shaped tail.

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.430
It's just part of the package.

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.660
If you were going to have
this canine-like thing

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.530
and be selected for
being scared of humans,

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.270
functioning in packs, having a
fairly aggressive temperament,

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.020
you're going to wind up looking
like a wolf after a while.

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.190
Same deal, again, very rapidly.

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.960
So unexpectedly,
Russia turns out

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.600
to be the motherland of all
sorts of interesting things

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.630
with puppies and puppies in the
past and puppies in the future

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.150
and all of that, so
that's wonderful.

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.650
OK.

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.530
However, I don't have
any pictures of them

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:02.150
that I've brought today,
but go to www.metrodog.edu

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.070
and see what they have to say.

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:06.800
OK, so picking up
on Monday's lecture,

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.280
I recognize Monday's lecture
was probably the first one

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.480
officially to be
able to blow half

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.100
of you guys out of
the water because it

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.160
was really tough material.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.060
Not only was it, as promised,
yet another disciplinary jump,

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.800
but it was the first
wave at a lot of material

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.460
that went by fairly fast,
and a lot of it quite subtle.

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:30.720
What are the things
to focus on in there?

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.020
What did we cover
Monday that's critical?

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.150
Behavior genetics as
an overall approach

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.720
is not doing the constructing
an evolutionary story.

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:40.790
Who's got the best story?

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:41.610
We win.

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.470
It's not molecular
genetics looking

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.530
at evolutionary change
driven by actual mutations

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.090
down at the molecular level.

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.150
Instead, it's looking
for patterns of behavior

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.550
that go along with relatedness.

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:01.200
What we saw was-- the most
completely useless version was,

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.710
well, here's a trait
that runs in a family,

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:06.110
and it runs in the family
more the more related

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:10.310
the individuals are--
completely useless, bringing

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:11.940
in the first of the
problems that we're

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.210
going to have nonstop
in the subject,

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:16.430
ruling out different
environments.

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.519
We saw a number of
the classic approaches

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.459
they have, which is
studying monozygotic

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.740
versus dizygotic twins,
studying adopted individuals,

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.430
or studying the gold standard
of identical twins separated

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.020
at birth, adopted, and then
brought back together again.

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.120
And in each one of
those cases, that's

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.040
explaining some degree of the
confusion, eliminating some

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.920
of the environment, but over,
and over, and over again,

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.150
this problem of environments
are sneaking in all sorts

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:47.360
of interesting ways.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.240
Adoption is nonrandom in terms
of where placement occurs.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.260
All sorts of stuff like that--
making it harder to tell.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.170
What we then transitioned
to was dealing

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:01.410
with the most interesting
realm of environment,

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:03.920
having influences, which
is this whole world

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:07.600
of prenatal environment and
environmental effects there,

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.030
one version of it being
this whole new field,

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:13.970
fetal origins of adult disease,
the fact that early events--

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:17.990
fetal environmental events--
can have lifelong consequences,

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:20.470
even multigenerational,
as we saw.

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:23.250
And people are understanding
the nuts and bolts

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:26.180
of how that might work,
that epigenetic stuff.

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.430
So we saw that as one--
a very subtle realm

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:32.420
of environment slipping in.

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:35.500
And we also saw examples
where "environment" could

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.720
be occurring within
an hour of birth,

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.570
and where environment
is occurring

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:43.070
despite seemingly like similar
things, like the number of math

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:46.430
classes you take-- environment
being very critical.

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:49.660
What we also saw, just to
make life a whole lot messier

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:51.860
and more complicated,
was violating

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.000
the rule we have all
known since infancy,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.560
which is you get equal genetic
input from each parent.

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:01.850
The business about mitochondria
coming from your mother--

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:05.880
the business about, as we
saw, more subtle version--

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:08.910
the same equal input
of genes, perhaps,

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:11.570
but the regulatory
control is much more

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:15.850
coming from the mother by way
of the transcription factors,

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:18.320
all of that and the
cytosol of the egg,

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:21.740
sperm having nothing interesting
going on from a cell biology

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:23.730
level, the egg
having all of this.

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:26.340
And where you can even
get something as nutty

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:31.260
as inheritance of an acquired
trait, Lamarckian evolution.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.220
OK, so that was plowing
through all of that,

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.840
and I'm fairly certain
that reviewing the last two

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:38.540
hours in these
last three minutes

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:40.500
has not put anybody
back in the water who

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:41.980
was blown out of the water.

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:46.310
So go to sections-- this
is difficult material,

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:48.110
and it's going to
get worse today.

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:49.460
OK, this is hard material.

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:51.970
Make sure you read the
extended notes because there's

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:55.030
a fighting chance that will be
more coherent than the lecture.

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:57.810
OK, so we got to
the point last time

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:01.750
around of seeing that,
OK, prenatal effects--

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:04.460
the last thing we focused on
was the actual nuts and bolts

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:07.170
of it, epigenetics, all of that.

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:11.930
Now we transition to what became
the much more modern, exciting

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:14.370
version of behavior
genetics, unless you happen

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:15.980
to have yourself
hundreds of pairs

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:18.490
of identical twins
separated at birth, which

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:22.820
is to go and actually find
the gene, finally beginning

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:27.430
to bring together-- to
marry the classical behavior

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:31.012
genetics approaches
with molecular biology.

00:07:31.012 --> 00:07:32.470
And it was starting
around the '80s

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:35.580
or so that people began
to be able to work

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:39.270
in actual molecular techniques
into this whole field,

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:41.920
and it started off in
a very primitive way

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.680
and has gotten much
better since then.

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:46.840
The version that you
can start off with

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:50.870
is you know something
about the trait,

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:53.100
or as we're really
saying here, you

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:55.620
know something about that
there are differences

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:58.090
in the trait among
different individuals,

00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:00.690
and now you go
looking for the gene.

00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:02.560
How do you do that?

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:04.590
The first classical
way of doing that

00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:07.820
is that you actually have
an observable difference

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:11.300
in two individuals,
in two populations,

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:13.770
in two branches of
the same family,

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:17.500
a difference in an external
manifestation of what's

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:19.130
going on with
genes, a difference

00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:23.490
in phenotype-- appearance,
behavior, some such thing.

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:26.290
And what you then do is
you use that approach

00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:29.630
to try to then find
genetic differences.

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:31.490
You get a whole
bunch of examples

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:34.100
of folks with one version,
a whole bunch of folks

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:36.679
with another version,
and you start looking

00:08:36.679 --> 00:08:38.850
for where the differences are.

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:41.020
Slightly more
constrained version,

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:43.549
you don't actually
have the phenotype.

00:08:43.549 --> 00:08:46.220
You are not looking
at eye color.

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:49.410
You are not looking at how
wrinkly somebody's face is.

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:52.940
You are not looking
at behavioral traits.

00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:55.140
You're not looking
at anything external.

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:58.120
The next more
focused step is now,

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:02.650
you're looking at proteins,
what some proteins do.

00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:07.110
Here is some enzyme that
turns this into that,

00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:10.190
and there's two different
ways the enzyme can do it

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:12.060
or two different variants on it.

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:14.522
And now, we've got
this bunch of people

00:09:14.522 --> 00:09:15.980
where we take their
blood and look,

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:17.430
and they've got this variant.

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:20.780
These guys have this version
of how the protein goes

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:22.180
about its business.

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:24.990
Can we find the
genetic difference?

00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:27.750
Next step down, next
step more frustrating--

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:30.970
when you can't see
external differences

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:32.190
that you're tracking.

00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:33.810
There is no
phenotypic difference

00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:35.870
that you've got to
work with, where

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:39.510
you don't know what the protein
does, what its function is.

00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:43.660
Next, lower rent version is to
look at the same protein that

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:46.930
comes in slightly
different sizes

00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:49.310
because that's usually
a hint that there

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:50.580
are different functions.

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:53.350
The way the protein
works is going to differ,

00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:55.670
and somewhere along
the way there,

00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:58.520
you came up with one
version by having

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:02.020
some insertion, mutation, or
deletion, or some such thing.

00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:03.776
You don't know what
the protein does,

00:10:03.776 --> 00:10:05.150
and you certainly
don't know what

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:07.520
that does in terms of the
individual's appearance,

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:10.510
behavior phenotype, but at
least you've got something

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:12.440
to work with there.

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:15.990
So what it is you are using as
your starting point-- easiest

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:17.450
external signs.

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:21.420
Next is what would be called
intermediate physiological

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:22.310
endpoints.

00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:24.800
Intermediate-- it's
something functional,

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:27.370
but it's not functional like
how the person functions.

00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:30.600
It's functional like how an
individual protein functions.

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:33.470
And then, if you're up the
creek with that, at least

00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:37.810
hopefully going for differences
in the size of the protein,

00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:40.650
the electrical charge
of the protein.

00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:44.250
For non-chemistry types, how
this version of the protein

00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:46.880
interacts with a
water environment

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:48.930
versus how that
version-- you don't

00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:51.000
know what the protein
does, but at least

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.700
you've got something
to work with.

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:54.370
You got a difference.

00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:56.650
In all of these
cases, the strategy

00:10:56.650 --> 00:10:59.680
is to then see what are
the gene differences that

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:00.970
go along with it?

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:05.270
Primitive initial version
would be as follows.

00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:07.060
You've got, for
example-- in this case,

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:11.640
you were trying to find
the gene for some disease.

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:13.180
And this is where
the whole field

00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:17.460
started because it is a lot
easier to go after a disease.

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:19.750
Either you have it
or you don't if you

00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:21.960
pick the right kind
of awful disease,

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:26.510
rather than going on a
phenotype like television taste.

00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:29.090
That one's going to be a lot
harder to find the gene for.

00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:33.620
The whole field started instead
looking at extremes of really

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:36.350
major league,
you-got-it-or-you-don't-have-it

00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:37.460
diseases.

00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:40.603
So you've got this family
that has this disease running

00:11:40.603 --> 00:11:45.090
in the family-- PKU,
phenylketonuria, for example,

00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:49.160
or Huntington's disease,
or cystic fibrosis.

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:51.180
These were some of
the first ones to go.

00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:53.580
And what you now do is
you've got the big family,

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:57.390
and what you want ideally is
a big huge family where about

00:11:57.390 --> 00:12:02.670
half the people have the
disease and half don't.

00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:05.160
And the initial way the
whole approach would be done

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.690
was you get blood samples
from everybody there,

00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:10.770
and you start sifting
through everybody's DNA,

00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:12.800
and you're looking
for a stretch of DNA

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:16.110
that everybody with a
disease has in common

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:20.080
and that none of the relatives
without the disease have.

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:21.670
And what you've
got at that point

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:25.820
is what would be called a
genetic marker because doing

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:29.400
it this way, you're just
sifting through a haystack.

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:32.240
You're just trying to pick
up big, crude patterns.

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:35.650
The difference that you wind
up seeing between these two

00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:38.970
populations of relatives
almost certainly-- in fact,

00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:41.490
as far as I know, never
once with this approach

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:44.520
had you just found
the individual gene.

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:46.600
You found a stretch
of DNA that's

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:49.030
got 10, 20, 30 genes in there.

00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:52.530
But somewhere in that stretch
is the interesting one.

00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:55.700
So at least you have
a genetic marker here.

00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:57.890
You know the
genetic neighborhood

00:12:57.890 --> 00:13:00.040
where the difference occurs.

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:03.190
So this was at one
point cutting edge,

00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:06.420
a technique called RFLP,
restriction fragment link

00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:07.360
polymorphisms.

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:08.760
Do not write that down.

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:11.280
And this technique
was incredibly

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:15.670
slick at some point early
on, and it is not easily done

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:20.930
because you are dumping
20,000 puzzle pieces over here

00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:22.960
and 20,000 there,
and you're looking

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:24.760
for the one difference
between the two

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:26.390
that's otherwise identical.

00:13:26.390 --> 00:13:28.160
It's that sort of task.

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:29.990
Nonetheless, using
that approach,

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:32.900
people began to
get disease markers

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:36.360
where they got the stretch
of DNA that contained

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:38.740
a whole bunch of genes
and who knows what else,

00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:41.180
but at least the
candidate gene, the gene

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:43.020
that was floating
around that was

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:45.930
responsible for this
disease, was somewhere

00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:48.260
in the stretch of DNA.

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:51.790
At that point, what would be
done is a number of things.

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:55.340
First is people would
obsessively, obsessively check

00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:59.800
their statistics to see just
how certain they are that this

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:02.240
is the genetic marker
for this disease

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:04.910
because you were soon
going to be advising people

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:07.760
whether to terminate
pregnancies based

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:09.640
on genetic tests like those.

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:14.260
This is an area where more
stringent rules were imposed

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:17.390
before you announce you think
you know how the universe works

00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:19.140
with respect to this disease.

00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:21.920
Really, really major
room for things

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:25.540
going wrong in terms of it
being then applied clinically,

00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:28.550
so first big demand
would be you really

00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:31.590
have to be much more certain--
a much more demanding field

00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:33.840
than lots of others in biology.

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:38.980
The next issue would be
this bioethics problem,

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:41.080
which is you've got
somebody from one

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:44.510
of these families who may
or may not have the disease.

00:14:44.510 --> 00:14:47.840
This is a disease that doesn't
get you until age whatever,

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:51.520
and you're younger than
that, and this immediately

00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:54.330
exploded this whole
issue for the first time.

00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:57.050
Should people get
tested if they have

00:14:57.050 --> 00:14:59.370
the genetic marker
for that disease,

00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:01.220
if they are a candidate for it?

00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:04.750
And this opened up a
whole world of confusion

00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:08.510
about this, where a key
feature of these debates

00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:11.720
was the fact that you
haven't gotten the gene.

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:14.850
You've just gotten the
candidate stretch of DNA,

00:15:14.850 --> 00:15:18.520
and there remains a very
small statistical chance

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:20.970
that you've got the wrong one.

00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:23.650
For a bunch of reasons,
there is that possibility.

00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:26.520
So do you let
somebody take a test?

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:29.360
Can people tell the difference
between a yes and no

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:31.240
and a statistical probability?

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:34.310
What do you do if it's a disease
where the person has just spent

00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:36.690
their last 10 years
watching their parents

00:15:36.690 --> 00:15:39.430
slowly die from it, and
there's no cure for it,

00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:40.810
and it's absolutely horrible?

00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:43.516
Do you give them a test that
is-- if the bad outcome is

00:15:43.516 --> 00:15:45.390
going to throw them off
the top of a building

00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:46.740
with a high likelihood?

00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:49.970
Enormously complex
bioethics issue.

00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:53.280
The third challenge, though,
was to step up the science

00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:55.550
from just having
the stretch of DNA

00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:59.270
with a bunch of genes in there
to actually find the gene.

00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:02.400
And in the years since, the
molecular biology has gotten

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:07.310
much, much better at moving
past finding a genetic marker,

00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:11.040
we are 99.9% certain that
the gene that's relevant

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:14.450
is somewhere in this stretch,
to finding the actual gene

00:16:14.450 --> 00:16:16.300
and then being
able to see what's

00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:19.060
the difference in it
between them and them.

00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:22.080
What's the difference,
down to base pairs?

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:23.660
Where is the mutation?

00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:25.430
Where's the difference
coming from?

00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:28.540
That's the world of
sequencing genomes now.

00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:30.570
That's where the field is at.

00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:34.480
So that has been enormously
powerful in terms

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:38.550
of potentially finding
one single gene.

00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:41.840
But everything that came through
in the molecular lectures

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:44.260
last week should be
pointing out there's

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:46.150
not a whole lot
going on in there

00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:49.770
that revolves around one
single gene at a time.

00:16:49.770 --> 00:16:52.570
So hold on to really
horrible diseases.

00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:55.660
Yeah, one gene, single
mutation, but most of what

00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:58.070
goes wrong, if you want
to start understanding

00:16:58.070 --> 00:17:03.120
the genetics of psychiatric
disorders, of diabetes,

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:07.099
of early-- of late-onset
dementias, things of that sort,

00:17:07.099 --> 00:17:09.390
it's not going to
be just one gene.

00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:11.710
So the next huge
advance in the field

00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:16.109
was being able to do searches
like these for multiple genes.

00:17:16.109 --> 00:17:18.800
One thing that has been
used is a technique called

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:21.369
microarrays, gene microarrays.

00:17:21.369 --> 00:17:24.150
And they were basically
invented here on campus by a guy

00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:27.720
over in the med school named
Pat Brown, who is already

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:29.880
very famous for
having done this and I

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:32.590
suspect has all sorts of
interesting awards coming

00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:33.960
for him down the line.

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:37.930
This spectacular technique-- you
take what is now called a gene

00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:41.320
chip, and through techniques
that are absolutely boggling

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:45.050
and make me feel queasy,
what you somehow manage to do

00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:48.580
is you get all the
copies of RNA that

00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:52.790
could be made in a cell
from this individual.

00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:54.830
If you are completely
new to this

00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:56.650
and you've managed
to get in this far

00:17:56.650 --> 00:17:59.350
without having to think
about what RNA is, ignore it.

00:17:59.350 --> 00:18:01.396
This is just sort of a
subtle detail for people

00:18:01.396 --> 00:18:02.520
who are interested in this.

00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:05.910
What you do is you get
a copy of each type

00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:08.170
of RNA made in a cell.

00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:12.420
You force the cell basically
to transcribe all of the genes

00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:13.160
it has.

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:15.100
And then you get
this little chip,

00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:18.730
and you basically glue the
end of each one of these RNAs

00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:21.100
to it, and you will
have a chip with 20,000

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:22.520
of these little things.

00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:25.030
And then you use
probes which will

00:18:25.030 --> 00:18:30.160
allow you to see which versions
of 20,000 of those genes

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:33.290
are different in this
individual from that individual.

00:18:33.290 --> 00:18:36.950
Total boggling, has
forced an entire new world

00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:40.780
of trying to analyze data,
this new field of informatics

00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:43.020
because you're not looking
at one gene at a time.

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:47.000
You're looking at patterns,
and that becomes a lot harder.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.060
That becomes
incredibly important

00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:53.240
because, again, it's all sorts
of the interesting stuff where

00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:54.490
it's not going to be one gene.

00:18:54.490 --> 00:18:55.330
It's a dozen.

00:18:55.330 --> 00:18:56.600
It's 100.

00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:59.490
So that has been one
challenging approach.

00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:03.730
Another is a technique called
QTLs, quantitative trait

00:19:03.730 --> 00:19:04.440
lowside.

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:06.660
What that basically
is built around--

00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:09.990
that if you have subtle enough
of tests, you could figure out

00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:14.550
this is a complex trait that
is modulated by two genes,

00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:17.510
or by three, or by 17.

00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:19.550
You can see all of this
going in the direction

00:19:19.550 --> 00:19:22.170
from techniques that
would let you know

00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:25.030
you're kind of in the
neighborhood of a gene,

00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:28.180
to actually identifying a gene
that differs between the two

00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:31.710
populations, to the much
more useful realistic world

00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:36.390
of whole bunches of genes,
networks going on at a time.

00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:38.330
So using these
approaches, people

00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:40.190
have made lots of progress.

00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:41.970
The most recent
version of that--

00:19:41.970 --> 00:19:44.260
I mentioned the other
day there, one type

00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:47.800
of mutation, a macro
mutation, is this business

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:52.770
about variants of major
stretches of DNA copy length

00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:54.720
variance, where a
whole stretch of DNA

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:58.250
is duplicated twice or
eleventy different times.

00:19:58.250 --> 00:20:01.250
Can you identify traits
that are occurring

00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:04.180
because of differences
in the number of copies?

00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:06.830
Yet another version
of dealing with

00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:11.560
this whole hierarchical,
multi-level business about gene

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:12.650
regulation.

00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:15.670
OK, take home message
from this is 20,

00:20:15.670 --> 00:20:17.640
30 years ago when
all of this started,

00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:21.830
you can start with a trait, and
through increasingly fancier

00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:24.960
techniques, you could find
the neighborhood of where

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:29.060
the gene is that the
different versions of the gene

00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:31.990
correspond to the different
versions of the trait-- moving

00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:35.450
from patterns of that to the
neighborhood of the genes

00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:38.310
to the actual gene to
whole bunches of genes

00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:42.060
to macro differences
there, that's one approach.

00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:43.830
The other approach
of the field has

00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:45.670
been starting the other way.

00:20:45.670 --> 00:20:47.220
You've got a gene.

00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:49.920
You've got a gene, and
thanks to researching it

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:53.350
in flies, and worms, and
rats, and all of that,

00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:55.880
you kind of have a sense
of what the gene does,

00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:59.380
and you have a reasonable
guess of what sort of traits

00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:01.850
might be relevant in
a human, and now you

00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:03.390
run it the other way.

00:21:03.390 --> 00:21:06.100
You have two different
versions of the gene,

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:09.180
and you look for
differences in behavior,

00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:11.350
or differences in
protein function,

00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:13.630
or differences in the
size of the protein.

00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:15.540
You start with the
genetic knowledge.

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:18.830
And for our purposes, where
people are mostly looking

00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:21.380
is at behavioral end points.

00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:23.050
So what do you see with that?

00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:26.570
Lots of findings in recent
years, and my feeling

00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:28.970
is this is one of the more
interesting ways of doing

00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:30.790
this behavior
genetics-- starting

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:32.820
with basic research
with animals.

00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:34.850
You've got some sense
of what the gene does.

00:21:34.850 --> 00:21:36.390
How about it in people?

00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:38.530
Because there is variability.

00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:42.700
First example, and this has to
do with a really interesting

00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:45.570
hormone that we will hear
plenty about down the line,

00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:47.860
a hormone called vasopressin.

00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:52.660
And vasopressin in rodents
I think I already discussed.

00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:57.110
Vasopressin in rodents has
a receptor, the vasopressin

00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:57.730
receptor.

00:21:57.730 --> 00:22:00.810
And what we talked about
the other week is depending

00:22:00.810 --> 00:22:03.200
on which version
of this you have,

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:06.020
if you happen to
be a vole male, it

00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:07.600
will determine
whether or not you

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:10.020
were monogamous or polygamous.

00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:11.180
That's interesting.

00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:14.090
What was also interesting
was that difference-- the two

00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:18.240
variants were not in the gene
itself but in the promoter,

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:22.140
and that winds up meaning that
the promoter caused in one

00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:27.080
strain the gene to be expressed
in different parts of the brain

00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:28.900
than in the other version of it.

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:32.570
OK, so what we saw there was all
sorts of hints from the animal

00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:37.320
world that vasopressin has stuff
to do with social affiliation,

00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:38.600
things of that sort.

00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:40.460
So what do you now do
if you want to apply

00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:42.080
this knowledge to humans?

00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:45.420
The first thing you
need to ask is, well,

00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:47.570
do we know where the
gene is in humans?

00:22:47.570 --> 00:22:50.370
And with modern sequencing
in the human genome,

00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:53.640
you've got it, so you know where
the gene is for the vasopressin

00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:54.460
receptor.

00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:56.040
And the next thing
you have to ask

00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:59.300
is, does it come in
two different flavors?

00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:01.170
Does it come in two
different flavors,

00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:03.690
and do they differ
in the same way

00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:06.930
as the ones people have
studied endlessly in rodents?

00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:07.720
Yay.

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:11.190
Yes, indeed, the receptor
gene is exactly the same

00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:13.350
in everyone, but there's
two different versions

00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:16.520
of the promoter--
the same exact story.

00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:17.810
So that's great.

00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:20.230
If you've gotten
that far, now you

00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:22.970
start looking for what
the differences are

00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:27.340
between people who have one
variant versus the other.

00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:28.840
And you've got to
do your homework.

00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:33.390
You got to match them for
age, and gender, and number

00:23:33.390 --> 00:23:35.520
of cavities, and all
sorts of stuff like that.

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:37.150
And when you've got
that under control,

00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:39.250
you go looking for behaviors.

00:23:39.250 --> 00:23:40.930
What's the limit of this?

00:23:40.930 --> 00:23:43.330
By definition, you're
only looking where

00:23:43.330 --> 00:23:44.830
the light is shining already.

00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:46.480
You're only looking
where you already

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:49.380
have a sense that maybe
you should be looking,

00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:51.440
unless you're totally
crazy-obsessive

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:54.430
and want to try to measure
everything possible in people

00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:55.800
and look for a difference.

00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:59.004
In most of these studies, you
kind of know where to look.

00:23:59.004 --> 00:24:00.670
That immediately means
there's all sorts

00:24:00.670 --> 00:24:02.280
of areas you're not looking.

00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:04.200
Nonetheless, with
this approach, people

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:08.080
have gone looking in humans
at these different variants

00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:10.690
on the vasopressin
receptor gene,

00:24:10.690 --> 00:24:13.910
and you find some really
interesting differences.

00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:17.220
One was a paper published
a couple years ago

00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:19.330
in a very prestigious
journal, which

00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:22.050
got picked up in the papers
all over the universe,

00:24:22.050 --> 00:24:25.690
showing if you have the
version of the promoter

00:24:25.690 --> 00:24:30.340
that you find in monogamous
male voles, you as a human male

00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:34.470
are likely to have more stable
relationships than if you

00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:36.420
have the other version of it.

00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:37.690
Whoa.

00:24:37.690 --> 00:24:39.700
That's pretty bizarre.

00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:41.050
That's pretty cool.

00:24:41.050 --> 00:24:43.300
Next thing, a study
that just came out

00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:46.050
in that same prestigious
journal a couple of weeks ago,

00:24:46.050 --> 00:24:47.660
and this is one
we're showing, which,

00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:50.920
depending on which version
you have, how good are you

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:54.030
reading facial expressions
in other people?

00:24:54.030 --> 00:24:56.780
Subtle differences in
facial expressions--

00:24:56.780 --> 00:25:00.010
then, there's a whole
other world of approaching,

00:25:00.010 --> 00:25:04.590
evidence emerging that in
families where autism runs

00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:08.820
majorly through the families,
people are seeing mutations

00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:13.010
in genes related to vasopressin
and the vasopressin receptor.

00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:15.480
So this is one
really cool example

00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:17.760
of starting with that
approach, and this

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:20.420
is a gene whose
variants have something

00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:23.280
to do with some pretty
meaningful realms

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:27.380
of human social connectiveness,
variability stuff.

00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:29.150
Totally interesting.

00:25:29.150 --> 00:25:34.340
Another example-- this is
a gene coding for a protein

00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:39.274
called BDNF, brain-derived
neurotrophic factor.

00:25:39.274 --> 00:25:40.190
Doesn't really matter.

00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:44.030
The main point of BDNF
is it prompts neurons

00:25:44.030 --> 00:25:47.320
into growing new processes.

00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:49.950
And it turns out, BDNF does
something that ultimately

00:25:49.950 --> 00:25:51.640
is kind of a drag for you.

00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:53.836
In one part of the
brain, the amygdala,

00:25:53.836 --> 00:25:55.960
which-- I think I've already
mentioned the amygdala

00:25:55.960 --> 00:26:00.280
has a lot to do with fear and
anxiety and that sort of thing,

00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:01.820
and we will come back to that.

00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:02.630
Don't panic.

00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:08.390
But the main thing is BDNF plays
a role in causing individuals--

00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:12.580
individual rats-- when they
are highly stressed to make

00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:16.980
the neurons in the amygdala grow
new connections, new processes.

00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:18.100
What are you doing?

00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:20.420
You are training that
rat to be anxious.

00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:22.790
You are training that rat
to be hyper-responsive

00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:24.130
to scary things.

00:26:24.130 --> 00:26:27.170
BDNF appears to play this role.

00:26:27.170 --> 00:26:30.030
So now, the next step in
this sequence-- and you'll

00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:33.060
begin to see it's the same
pattern over and over-- people

00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:37.430
then found, ah, there's a couple
of different flavors of BDNF.

00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:40.320
There are a couple of
different genetic variants.

00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:41.860
There's a couple
of different ways

00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:45.750
in which BDNF pops up in
rats or mice or whatever,

00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:50.020
differing by a base pair
here, an amino acid there,

00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:53.330
where you then do your
scutwork and show, OK,

00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:59.200
this BDNF works faster than that
version of it or it works less

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:01.820
but it lasts longer,
or who knows what.

00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:03.710
You find a functional
difference.

00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:05.620
There's a genetic difference.

00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:07.274
There's two different
versions of it,

00:27:07.274 --> 00:27:08.690
and it actually
makes a difference

00:27:08.690 --> 00:27:10.280
for how the protein functions.

00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:12.450
And this has all been
studied in animals,

00:27:12.450 --> 00:27:16.360
and now you understand what it's
doing in the amygdala of a rat,

00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:17.910
depending on which
version you have.

00:27:17.910 --> 00:27:20.920
And then the exact
same strategy--

00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:24.720
go look at the BDNF gene
in humans and ask, well,

00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:26.930
do you see the same difference?

00:27:26.930 --> 00:27:29.620
Are the same two
flavors in humans

00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:30.900
popping up as in rodents?

00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:31.820
Yes, indeed.

00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:34.150
And then, the exact
same approach again,

00:27:34.150 --> 00:27:37.240
looking for differences, and
you know where to start looking.

00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:39.340
What has that
literature been showing?

00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:42.360
The type of BDNF
variant that you

00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:45.890
have in the exact same way
that it maps in rodents maps

00:27:45.890 --> 00:27:49.550
onto your likelihood
of an anxiety disorder,

00:27:49.550 --> 00:27:52.870
the levels of stress
hormones in your bloodstream,

00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:56.980
the levels of metabolic
activity in your amygdala,

00:27:56.980 --> 00:27:59.460
the same exact sort of finding.

00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:02.560
Next, a whole other
world, which we will learn

00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:04.090
much more about down the line.

00:28:04.090 --> 00:28:06.390
This is obviously a quick
survey of a whole bunch

00:28:06.390 --> 00:28:07.290
of different areas.

00:28:07.290 --> 00:28:09.820
All of these we will
come back to big time

00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:11.010
later on in the course.

00:28:11.010 --> 00:28:13.550
Next area, this
neurotransmitter,

00:28:13.550 --> 00:28:17.220
dopamine-- you will learn
amazing amounts about dopamine.

00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:19.250
Dopamine, which
works through a-- you

00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:22.190
guessed it-- dopamine
receptor-- and in fact, there

00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:25.370
is a gazillion different
types of dopamine receptors.

00:28:25.370 --> 00:28:28.930
And dopamine
receptor number four,

00:28:28.930 --> 00:28:32.040
D4, the dopamine
receptor four gene

00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:35.180
has something to do with a whole
bunch of interesting traits

00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:36.380
in rodents.

00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:40.250
And it comes with variability
in the rodent versions,

00:28:40.250 --> 00:28:43.240
different flavors, and
humans have variability

00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:44.650
along similar lines.

00:28:44.650 --> 00:28:47.520
And dopamine-- what is
dopamine involved in?

00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:54.030
Pleasure, and anticipation,
and reward-seeking behavior.

00:28:54.030 --> 00:28:57.190
What two different versions
of the dopamine type

00:28:57.190 --> 00:29:02.210
four, the D4 receptor gene,
begin to map onto in humans?

00:29:02.210 --> 00:29:07.960
Levels of risk-taking behavior,
levels of sensation seeking,

00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:11.390
levels of novelty craving.

00:29:11.390 --> 00:29:13.330
That's interesting.

00:29:13.330 --> 00:29:18.200
Another example, a gene
called NPY-- a protein,

00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:22.330
a neurotransmitter called
neuropeptide Y. Do not get

00:29:22.330 --> 00:29:23.740
overwhelmed by all of these.

00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:26.050
It's just the same
pattern over and over.

00:29:26.050 --> 00:29:30.590
NPY, same deal again-- and
two different human variants

00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:33.760
have something to do with
differences in levels,

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:38.760
again, of anxiety, of metabolic
rates in the amygdala,

00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:40.500
all of that.

00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:42.150
And in this case,
the NPY difference

00:29:42.150 --> 00:29:43.910
is quite interesting
because it's

00:29:43.910 --> 00:29:45.810
one of those where
the difference is not

00:29:45.810 --> 00:29:47.950
in the gene structure sequence.

00:29:47.950 --> 00:29:50.530
It's once again a
difference in the promoter.

00:29:50.530 --> 00:29:53.270
OK, so what have we
have in all of these?

00:29:53.270 --> 00:29:55.470
This is a really
powerful approach.

00:29:55.470 --> 00:29:57.590
The first version
that we heard, you've

00:29:57.590 --> 00:29:59.190
got a behavioral difference.

00:29:59.190 --> 00:30:01.880
You've got a
phenotypic difference.

00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:05.040
You've got a difference in
how two proteins function,

00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:06.120
or their size.

00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:09.520
Go looking for what's the
genetic difference between

00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:11.910
those who have this trait
and those who don't.

00:30:11.910 --> 00:30:14.350
This version, reverse
engineering it,

00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:18.310
you start off with a gene that
comes in different flavors.

00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:20.850
You got a sense of what it
does from animal studies.

00:30:20.850 --> 00:30:23.810
Do you have the same
variation in humans,

00:30:23.810 --> 00:30:25.770
and does it map onto behavior?

00:30:25.770 --> 00:30:27.720
So all of these are amazing.

00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:29.980
All of these, it
has to be emphasized

00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:32.290
in a way that will come
back to haunt us also

00:30:32.290 --> 00:30:37.100
big time-- all of these
explain tiny percentages

00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:40.040
of the variability in the data.

00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:42.270
There is nothing
remotely resembling

00:30:42.270 --> 00:30:45.220
a world in which
if you have flavor

00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:48.790
vanilla of the D4 receptor
versus if you have flavor

00:30:48.790 --> 00:30:50.970
chocolate-- if you
have flavor vanilla,

00:30:50.970 --> 00:30:54.560
you are going to be hand gliding
when you are in preschool.

00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:56.890
You're going to be
totally sensation seeking.

00:30:56.890 --> 00:30:58.399
And if you have
the other version,

00:30:58.399 --> 00:31:00.440
you're going to spend your
entire life collecting

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:02.510
stamps or who knows what.

00:31:02.510 --> 00:31:04.270
It's not that deterministic.

00:31:04.270 --> 00:31:06.930
No surprise with
this gene stuff.

00:31:06.930 --> 00:31:10.560
No single gene is going to
be particularly deterministic

00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:14.300
once you get outside the
world of phenylketonuria

00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:16.160
and cystic fibrosis and such.

00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:19.900
They contribute some
explanatory power.

00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:24.620
So on one hand, amazingly cool,
seeing these genetic links

00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:26.850
to aspects of human behavior.

00:31:26.850 --> 00:31:29.540
On the other hand, they're
not very big effects,

00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:31.190
and this is something
we will come back

00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:33.020
to endlessly down the line.

00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:38.030
OK, so this is how the field has
gone about more recently trying

00:31:38.030 --> 00:31:43.320
to find links between variation
in genes or their promoters

00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:47.740
and variations in aspect of
behavior, running it both ways.

00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:50.020
And what all of
this is looking at,

00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:51.880
what is intrinsic
in everything we've

00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:53.900
been talking about with
this behavior genetics,

00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:56.960
is oh, my God, the
cliche finally emerges.

00:31:56.960 --> 00:32:00.690
Nature and nurture, and
gene and environment,

00:32:00.690 --> 00:32:02.630
and gene/environment
interactions--

00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:05.500
what is becoming increasingly
clear in the field

00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:09.170
is there's a third
leg to all of this.

00:32:09.170 --> 00:32:12.550
There's a third leg that
could be extremely powerful

00:32:12.550 --> 00:32:16.000
and is going to be the basis
for the chaos and complexity

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.280
lectures down the
line, which is chance,

00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:22.360
the role of random
events, the role

00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:27.300
of chance in being a form that
transcends what we would call

00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:30.300
environment and is
certainly not genetics,

00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:33.240
a whole different world
where that contributes.

00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:37.290
OK, where will we see chance
playing out an important role

00:32:37.290 --> 00:32:38.400
in all of this?

00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:43.270
Brownian motion-- for those who
don't have a techie background,

00:32:43.270 --> 00:32:45.490
I will describe it in the
way that I understand it,

00:32:45.490 --> 00:32:47.300
which is flailing desperately.

00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:51.310
Brownian motion has to do
with the fact that molecules

00:32:51.310 --> 00:32:56.380
oscillate and use an intrinsic
movement, oscillation,

00:32:56.380 --> 00:32:57.600
of molecules.

00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:59.890
You take a whatever
full of water

00:32:59.890 --> 00:33:02.830
filled with all sorts of
things-- molecules, whatever--

00:33:02.830 --> 00:33:04.550
and they're all
going to be vibrating

00:33:04.550 --> 00:33:07.680
to a certain extent because
of this Brownian motion.

00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:11.180
I suspect that was the most
amazingly incorrect description

00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:13.830
of what Brownian motion
is, but that's the point.

00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:17.480
That's the main point, simply
that there is this oscillation,

00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:19.820
which is completely random.

00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:22.310
It is just an intrinsic
feature of how

00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:26.430
the world of physics and Albert
Einstein's mustache works.

00:33:26.430 --> 00:33:29.750
And so you've got this
Brownian motion stuff going on.

00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:33.190
So where might that play
out in terms of chance?

00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:39.300
So we got here a cell with our
four powerhouses of the cell

00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:39.860
here.

00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:42.890
And on the right-- let's assume
this is a genetically identical

00:33:42.890 --> 00:33:45.810
cell, and I just got tired
of drawing it completely--

00:33:45.810 --> 00:33:47.690
but the same four mitochondria.

00:33:47.690 --> 00:33:51.050
And what we see here
first off is genetically,

00:33:51.050 --> 00:33:53.070
these mitochondria differ.

00:33:53.070 --> 00:33:54.380
One of them has a blue spot.

00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:55.630
One of them has a red sweater.

00:33:55.630 --> 00:33:57.160
Wait a second.

00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:59.740
Every single cell in
your body was built out

00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:02.960
of the same genome when
you started off life.

00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:03.760
Ah-ha.

00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:05.770
Back to that thing
the other day.

00:34:05.770 --> 00:34:08.870
Mitochondria have their own DNA.

00:34:08.870 --> 00:34:11.480
Mitochondria are going
about their own business

00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:14.710
of dividing in the
cell, of replicating

00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:18.800
their-- replicating themselves
now and then with a mutation.

00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:23.550
Within any given cell, the
mitochondrial sequence of DNA

00:34:23.550 --> 00:34:26.179
is going to differ from
one mitochondria to another

00:34:26.179 --> 00:34:28.949
because they've been
separate organisms that

00:34:28.949 --> 00:34:32.400
are inside a cell going
about their own evolution,

00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:34.770
their own mutations,
their own whatever.

00:34:34.770 --> 00:34:36.909
What you then
have-- what would be

00:34:36.909 --> 00:34:41.280
called a mosaic of
different genetic profiles

00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:44.070
of the mitochondria
within a cell.

00:34:44.070 --> 00:34:46.929
So that in and of itself
is pretty interesting

00:34:46.929 --> 00:34:49.040
because this is a
whole other world.

00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:52.909
This is not the DNA
back in the nucleus,

00:34:52.909 --> 00:34:55.630
and this is not
variability introduced

00:34:55.630 --> 00:34:59.580
by jumping genes or
accessibility of transcription

00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:01.120
factors to genes, all that.

00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:03.730
This is-- meanwhile,
outside the nucleus,

00:35:03.730 --> 00:35:07.070
there's this whole weirdo world
of these mitochondria that

00:35:07.070 --> 00:35:08.780
are functioning
all on their own,

00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:11.830
so the different
mitochondria in the same cell

00:35:11.830 --> 00:35:14.720
will have different
genetic makeups.

00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:15.620
So great.

00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:17.930
So these two cells are
absolutely identical.

00:35:17.930 --> 00:35:20.810
Each of them have four
mitochondria, and each of them

00:35:20.810 --> 00:35:22.650
have two red kinds,
one blue kind,

00:35:22.650 --> 00:35:24.250
and one that gets nothing.

00:35:24.250 --> 00:35:28.700
So now that cell is going to
go about splitting in two.

00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:33.550
And what happens is it splits.

00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:37.260
And in the process of splitting,
what the fluid, the cytosol,

00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:40.250
the stuff inside where all
the molecules-- including

00:35:40.250 --> 00:35:43.140
the mitochondria in the
other organelles-- are found.

00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:45.630
And it splits,
and there winds up

00:35:45.630 --> 00:35:47.180
being a very simple question.

00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:51.890
Which mitochondria wind
up in which daughter cell?

00:35:51.890 --> 00:35:56.460
And what we've got here is in
this case, a split like that.

00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:58.580
In this case, a split like that.

00:35:58.580 --> 00:35:59.900
Oh my god, why did that happen?

00:35:59.900 --> 00:36:02.220
Is that because there is
a gene in this one that

00:36:02.220 --> 00:36:06.460
says when you form a new pair
of cells, have blue and blank

00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:08.110
in one and two
reds in the other?

00:36:08.110 --> 00:36:11.900
And this one is a completely
different instruction manual

00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:13.270
for how you split cells.

00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:17.360
No, simple randomness of
where the mitochondria were

00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:19.390
in the cell when they split.

00:36:19.390 --> 00:36:22.110
A totally random event.

00:36:22.110 --> 00:36:24.830
So what you see here
is you start off

00:36:24.830 --> 00:36:28.320
with two cells that are
genetically identical.

00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:31.270
And within one round
of cell splitting,

00:36:31.270 --> 00:36:33.710
these genetically
identical individuals

00:36:33.710 --> 00:36:36.080
are already
genetically different.

00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:37.040
How come?

00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:39.010
Because of instructions
or a blueprint?

00:36:39.010 --> 00:36:39.560
No.

00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:42.950
Simply because
molecules, organelles,

00:36:42.950 --> 00:36:45.340
things like mitochondria
just oscillating around.

00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:48.700
And along comes a split, and
who is stuck on which side

00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:49.690
of the divide.

00:36:49.690 --> 00:36:52.600
So you've got
variability that way.

00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:56.100
Intrinsic in that is another
type of variability, which

00:36:56.100 --> 00:36:57.490
the second I
mention it, you will

00:36:57.490 --> 00:36:59.660
be able to run
with effortlessly,

00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:02.740
which is floating
around in here also

00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:07.670
will be transcription
factors, and splicing enzymes,

00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:09.320
and other enzymes.

00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:11.860
And along comes the split.

00:37:11.860 --> 00:37:13.910
And there is not
the remotest chance

00:37:13.910 --> 00:37:17.320
that half of every single
type of transcription factor

00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:20.110
is going to go each way, and
half of every type of splicing

00:37:20.110 --> 00:37:21.690
enzyme, et cetera.

00:37:21.690 --> 00:37:24.060
It's going to be who's
oscillating where

00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:26.110
and where the cells splits.

00:37:26.110 --> 00:37:30.090
So you wind up not only
with different outcomes

00:37:30.090 --> 00:37:32.317
in terms of mitochondria
and their genetic makeup,

00:37:32.317 --> 00:37:34.150
you're going to have
different distributions

00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:36.330
of different types of
transcription factors.

00:37:36.330 --> 00:37:40.790
All due to this random
oscillatory stuff.

00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:44.150
So that's one big component
where chance plays a role.

00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:46.310
And what the chaos
complexity lectures

00:37:46.310 --> 00:37:48.120
are going to be
very heavily about

00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:50.530
is just how important
stuff like this

00:37:50.530 --> 00:37:55.440
is, how important it is in
explaining what goes on,

00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:58.610
how important it is in
explaining why, no matter

00:37:58.610 --> 00:38:01.780
how much you know about what
every single molecule is having

00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:03.850
for lunch next
Tuesday, there's still

00:38:03.850 --> 00:38:07.100
going to be a huge degree
of unpredictability.

00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:08.520
All of that is to come.

00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:11.770
This is just beginning to
establish the idea yes, nature,

00:38:11.770 --> 00:38:13.130
nurture, nature, nurture.

00:38:13.130 --> 00:38:16.960
Chance also is the third leg
in there playing a large role.

00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:20.020
Whether chance is
what's going on when

00:38:20.020 --> 00:38:23.270
you get a transposable event--
you remember at the point

00:38:23.270 --> 00:38:26.220
that neural stem cells
are beginning to divide

00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:27.190
into neurons.

00:38:27.190 --> 00:38:30.270
That's when they juggle around
their transposable genes

00:38:30.270 --> 00:38:31.430
most dramatically.

00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:34.840
Whether that is a completely
random event as to where

00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:37.710
the copies land when
they come back to Earth,

00:38:37.710 --> 00:38:39.400
I'm not sure if people know.

00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:42.580
But I suspect there's an
element of chance in there also.

00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:45.560
So this is introducing
that notion in there.

00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:46.230
So great.

00:38:46.230 --> 00:38:48.460
So now you've got
all these caviats,

00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:51.020
which is environment
is subtle and coming

00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:53.350
all over the place,
and early experience,

00:38:53.350 --> 00:38:57.100
and epigenetic changes, and all
the different ways you could

00:38:57.100 --> 00:38:59.160
find genes linked to behavior.

00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:01.190
And don't forget,
variability also

00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:02.780
has something to do with chance.

00:39:02.780 --> 00:39:04.640
At the end of the
day though, what

00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:07.060
all of the behavior
genetic approach

00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:10.930
is going to come down to at
the end is a single number.

00:39:10.930 --> 00:39:15.030
We have studied this trait
with adoption techniques,

00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:18.500
with looking for
genetic markers,

00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:21.780
with looking for
copy length variance.

00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:25.510
We have studied this trait
and the variability of it.

00:39:25.510 --> 00:39:28.240
And thanks to us studying
for a gazillion years,

00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:34.100
we can now conclude that 53.5%
percent of the variability

00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:36.390
in this trait is heritable.

00:39:36.390 --> 00:39:39.040
You come up with this
number at the end.

00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:43.730
This trait has a
53% heritability.

00:39:43.730 --> 00:39:46.240
That's the number that
winds up coming out.

00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:49.420
Scientists report that
this or that trait

00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:53.170
has variability as
80% heritability.

00:39:53.170 --> 00:39:56.230
This is the number that
always comes out at the end.

00:39:56.230 --> 00:39:58.460
What's the heritability?

00:39:58.460 --> 00:40:02.870
Ranging somewhere
from 0% up to 100%.

00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:05.230
This is heritability.

00:40:05.230 --> 00:40:07.600
And this is absolutely critical.

00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:11.290
Because this is a truly
influential number.

00:40:11.290 --> 00:40:13.180
The one that people
come away with when

00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:17.440
they are being taught,
Oh, this trait is genetic.

00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:18.960
Those who want to
be quantitative

00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:22.520
will have been told, Whoa this
trait has 80% heritability.

00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:25.340
It has 90% heritability,
all of that.

00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:28.204
And it's the wrong
interpretation.

00:40:28.204 --> 00:40:30.370
And what we're going to
spend a bunch of time on now

00:40:30.370 --> 00:40:33.740
is looking at what
heritability actually means.

00:40:33.740 --> 00:40:35.830
The heritability
number-- because it

00:40:35.830 --> 00:40:39.170
is completely different
from the everyday intuition

00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:40.080
about what it means.

00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:42.070
And what it's
usually telling you

00:40:42.070 --> 00:40:46.520
is how unimportant genes are
in the deterministic way rather

00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:47.780
than the other way around.

00:40:47.780 --> 00:40:48.280
OK.

00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:50.130
So what does everyone assume?

00:40:50.130 --> 00:40:52.830
What is heritability
telling you?

00:40:52.830 --> 00:40:55.630
It is telling you
how much do genes

00:40:55.630 --> 00:40:59.830
determine the average
level of this trait.

00:40:59.830 --> 00:41:04.430
You have one version of a gene,
and there's the other flavor.

00:41:04.430 --> 00:41:09.790
And they produce different
average levels of some behavior

00:41:09.790 --> 00:41:10.970
or something at the end.

00:41:10.970 --> 00:41:13.510
What heritability
is teaching you,

00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:15.570
if you've got this
completely wrong notion,

00:41:15.570 --> 00:41:17.920
it's teaching you
how much do genes

00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:22.300
have to do with the average
level of that behavior,

00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:23.890
that trait, that whatever.

00:41:23.890 --> 00:41:26.700
That's not what
heritability actually means.

00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:29.600
What heritability as
a number is telling

00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:33.270
you is not what genes have
to do with the average level

00:41:33.270 --> 00:41:35.530
of the trait, it's
what genes have

00:41:35.530 --> 00:41:38.980
to do with the
degree of variability

00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:41.800
around that average.

00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:44.020
This is a point where
things immediately

00:41:44.020 --> 00:41:48.920
seem panicky and start getting
very, very complicated,

00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:49.890
all of that.

00:41:49.890 --> 00:41:51.930
We will see it's not that bad.

00:41:51.930 --> 00:41:53.890
And it's not that bad
in a very critical way.

00:42:00.730 --> 00:42:02.860
OK, simple first sense
of getting at it.

00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:06.310
Here's two populations where
you measure something or other.

00:42:06.310 --> 00:42:09.950
And these three individuals,
they come in at nine, 10, 11.

00:42:09.950 --> 00:42:12.740
And these come in at one,
10, and 19, or whatever.

00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:13.750
What's going on here?

00:42:13.750 --> 00:42:14.880
You average them.

00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:17.260
They have the
exact same average.

00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:18.500
What's the difference?

00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:21.590
There's a lot more
variability around the average

00:42:21.590 --> 00:42:23.570
here than in this case.

00:42:23.570 --> 00:42:25.680
What's the wrong
idea that people

00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:28.300
have that heritability means?

00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:31.490
It's telling you
how much do genes

00:42:31.490 --> 00:42:33.990
determine the average here.

00:42:33.990 --> 00:42:35.400
That's not what it's doing.

00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:40.790
It's how much do genes determine
how much variability there is.

00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:43.830
Initially, this seems
like a very subtle point.

00:42:43.830 --> 00:42:44.912
And what's the big deal?

00:42:44.912 --> 00:42:46.370
Because at the end
of the day, it's

00:42:46.370 --> 00:42:48.660
still talking about how
important genes are.

00:42:48.660 --> 00:42:50.960
What we'll see now
is it's actually

00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:54.140
a way of seeing how less
deterministic genes are

00:42:54.140 --> 00:42:55.770
in lots of cases.

00:42:55.770 --> 00:42:59.150
So this heritability stuff,
talking about variants.

00:42:59.150 --> 00:43:01.045
Here we have an example.

00:43:06.330 --> 00:43:09.740
We've got some plant.

00:43:09.740 --> 00:43:12.280
Some plant with
some gene that comes

00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:13.960
in three different flavors.

00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:17.130
And you measure something
or other about the plant.

00:43:17.130 --> 00:43:20.500
This is how much
water it retains,

00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:22.830
or of the plant's IQ,
or something like that.

00:43:22.830 --> 00:43:25.500
You're measuring some
trait, and you're asking,

00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:28.960
Does it differ as a function
of which version of this gene

00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:29.620
you have?

00:43:29.620 --> 00:43:32.250
So you do your study,
and this is what you see.

00:43:32.250 --> 00:43:33.710
And you say, Whoa, OK.

00:43:33.710 --> 00:43:36.210
I went and looked at this
plant in a rain forest,

00:43:36.210 --> 00:43:38.730
and we identified the
genetic versions of it.

00:43:38.730 --> 00:43:42.300
And look-- very different.

00:43:42.300 --> 00:43:45.900
The gene that you have
there, knowing that,

00:43:45.900 --> 00:43:47.780
gives you a lot of
predictive power

00:43:47.780 --> 00:43:51.000
over what level of
whatever it is that you're

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:52.720
measuring this plant is.

00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:53.670
That's great.

00:43:53.670 --> 00:43:55.890
So you're going to get
your doctorate out of that,

00:43:55.890 --> 00:43:57.352
and you get some publications.

00:43:57.352 --> 00:43:59.560
And it's great, and you
finally stop being a student.

00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:00.590
And it's terrific.

00:44:00.590 --> 00:44:03.440
And meanwhile,
some individual who

00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:05.760
shares like none of
your genes in common

00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:08.240
on the other side of
the planet, meanwhile

00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:11.230
there are some S-O-B who's
studying the exact same plant

00:44:11.230 --> 00:44:13.350
in the middle of
the Gobi Desert.

00:44:13.350 --> 00:44:15.710
You're sitting here in
the Amazon studying this,

00:44:15.710 --> 00:44:18.680
and here's this individual
doing the exact same kind

00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:20.690
of experiment,
saying, Oh, here we

00:44:20.690 --> 00:44:23.310
have this unlikely plant
that grows both in the Amazon

00:44:23.310 --> 00:44:24.390
and the Gobi Desert.

00:44:24.390 --> 00:44:26.720
But here we have this, and
we're studying this here.

00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:28.320
And what am I studying?

00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:31.160
I'm studying those
three variants.

00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:33.610
Those three variants
of this gene.

00:44:33.610 --> 00:44:38.200
And I'm asking do they
influence plant IQ?

00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:40.770
The same thing that you
were asking over here.

00:44:40.770 --> 00:44:43.420
And that individual
was doing their study,

00:44:43.420 --> 00:44:46.910
and they see that yes,
indeed, the gene influences

00:44:46.910 --> 00:44:48.450
what version that you have.

00:44:48.450 --> 00:44:51.270
And here you had A,
B, and C. And here's

00:44:51.270 --> 00:44:55.330
what they see when
they measure plant IQ.

00:44:55.330 --> 00:44:57.550
And it looks like that.

00:44:57.550 --> 00:44:59.130
And what do they conclude?

00:44:59.130 --> 00:45:00.660
Whoa, look at that.

00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:02.700
Knowing what version
of the gene you

00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:05.290
have gives me enormous
predictive power

00:45:05.290 --> 00:45:08.890
in predicting what the
plant IQ is going to be.

00:45:08.890 --> 00:45:12.840
And then catastrophically,
tragically, the two of you

00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:15.370
meet each other and
discover that you're both

00:45:15.370 --> 00:45:16.820
researching the same plant.

00:45:16.820 --> 00:45:21.040
And you look at your
numbers, and your heart

00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:22.400
breaks at that point.

00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:25.790
Because you look at these,
and what's going on here?

00:45:25.790 --> 00:45:26.760
What's going on?

00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:29.220
Let's translate this
notion of heritability,

00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:30.510
and variance, and all of that.

00:45:30.510 --> 00:45:33.870
Let's translate it into
a very simple question

00:45:33.870 --> 00:45:37.360
you can ask, translating
all of this in English.

00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:43.520
You're interested in what this
gene has to do with plant IQ.

00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:46.970
And you're allowed to find
out one piece of information.

00:45:46.970 --> 00:45:52.280
You could know whether the
plant has version A, B, or C,

00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:55.320
or you could know
whether the plant is

00:45:55.320 --> 00:45:58.250
growing in the Amazon
or the Gobi Desert.

00:45:58.250 --> 00:46:01.290
Which piece of information
is going to give you

00:46:01.290 --> 00:46:03.890
more predictive power?

00:46:03.890 --> 00:46:07.490
And what you wind up seeing
here is if you can either

00:46:07.490 --> 00:46:10.240
know this or the
environment, you

00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:12.200
want to know what
the environment is.

00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:19.050
The variability-- plant IQ could
come in at 98, 100, 102, eight,

00:46:19.050 --> 00:46:21.340
10, and 12.

00:46:21.340 --> 00:46:25.020
Far more of the variability
in those six numbers

00:46:25.020 --> 00:46:27.420
is explained by what
environment it's

00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:31.430
going on in rather than
the genetic difference.

00:46:31.430 --> 00:46:34.030
That's what heritability
is telling you.

00:46:34.030 --> 00:46:36.680
And in a study like
this, it would tell you

00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:40.420
that the heritability number
is actually quite low.

00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:45.120
Because the amount of variation
due to this is far less

00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:48.590
explained by the gene
type than whether it's

00:46:48.590 --> 00:46:51.700
the Amazon or the Gobi Desert.

00:46:51.700 --> 00:46:53.710
So that's a first pass at it.

00:46:53.710 --> 00:46:55.940
Why is this really important?

00:46:55.940 --> 00:46:57.810
For the following reason.

00:46:57.810 --> 00:47:00.460
You're a scientist,
and you are trying

00:47:00.460 --> 00:47:05.380
to understand how A, B,
and C influence plant IQ.

00:47:05.380 --> 00:47:07.740
And you come up with
something nutty and stupid

00:47:07.740 --> 00:47:09.690
like saying, Well,
I would like to be

00:47:09.690 --> 00:47:13.750
able to do field seasons in both
the Amazon and the Gobi Desert.

00:47:13.750 --> 00:47:16.830
And your advisor will
say, or all of your elders

00:47:16.830 --> 00:47:19.630
will say something like,
No, you can't do that.

00:47:19.630 --> 00:47:24.450
Because that's just-- you're
not controlling for environment.

00:47:24.450 --> 00:47:29.300
You're not studying it in only
one controlled environment.

00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:31.550
You can't go to-- they're
such different ecosystems,

00:47:31.550 --> 00:47:32.230
all of that.

00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:34.970
Pick one and go study it there.

00:47:34.970 --> 00:47:37.140
And what you do is
you go study it there.

00:47:37.140 --> 00:47:39.010
And as a result of
just studying it here,

00:47:39.010 --> 00:47:41.800
you come away thinking
that virtually

00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:45.260
all of the variability
is explained by genes.

00:47:45.260 --> 00:47:47.540
What have you just done?

00:47:47.540 --> 00:47:51.100
You explicitly have
designed your experiment

00:47:51.100 --> 00:47:54.910
so that you can't detect
the environmental role

00:47:54.910 --> 00:47:56.820
in determining that trait.

00:47:56.820 --> 00:48:01.170
What counts as setting up the
experiment as the right way

00:48:01.170 --> 00:48:03.180
for people who think
about this sort of thing,

00:48:03.180 --> 00:48:05.450
standard sort of
approaches to experiment,

00:48:05.450 --> 00:48:10.640
what counts as doing a good
job by definition, what you're

00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:14.530
doing is biasing towards
thinking the genetic input

00:48:14.530 --> 00:48:17.370
is more important
than it actually is.

00:48:17.370 --> 00:48:20.660
Because scientists don't
decide to study this trait

00:48:20.660 --> 00:48:21.700
in two different places.

00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:23.800
You don't decide
to do a study where

00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:27.570
you're looking at some trait
in both rats and ocelots,

00:48:27.570 --> 00:48:28.140
or something.

00:48:31.020 --> 00:48:32.930
Look, pick one species.

00:48:32.930 --> 00:48:34.990
Maybe even pick just one gender.

00:48:34.990 --> 00:48:36.290
Pick one environment.

00:48:36.290 --> 00:48:38.980
Don't have your rats in one room
where the air conditioning is

00:48:38.980 --> 00:48:42.480
going nonstop and the other
room you're barbecuing stuff.

00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:45.370
Control for environment.

00:48:45.370 --> 00:48:46.870
And by definition,
if you've done

00:48:46.870 --> 00:48:49.172
the nice, careful,
responsible thing

00:48:49.172 --> 00:48:51.630
that a scientist's supposed to
do doing this sort of thing,

00:48:51.630 --> 00:48:53.300
you control for environment.

00:48:53.300 --> 00:48:55.250
What have you just done?

00:48:55.250 --> 00:48:57.270
You have just
removed your ability

00:48:57.270 --> 00:48:59.720
to see the role of environment.

00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:03.010
And you have just artificially
inflated how important

00:49:03.010 --> 00:49:04.690
you think the genes are.

00:49:04.690 --> 00:49:06.410
OK, let's take a
five minute break.

00:49:06.410 --> 00:49:08.580
We are going to look at
this in a lot more detail.

00:49:08.580 --> 00:49:11.450
Do not freak out if this is
not immediately intuitively

00:49:11.450 --> 00:49:13.010
obvious.

00:49:13.010 --> 00:49:14.940
Questions that just came up.

00:49:14.940 --> 00:49:16.740
The first one is
pointing out one

00:49:16.740 --> 00:49:19.840
of those where I probably
should have actually taught

00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:21.340
something clearer.

00:49:21.340 --> 00:49:25.460
What are you talking about with
proteins being different sizes?

00:49:25.460 --> 00:49:27.880
How do you figure out
proteins are different sizes?

00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:29.920
And the answer is
you make them stand

00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:31.940
against the wall in their
bedroom with a ruler,

00:49:31.940 --> 00:49:33.080
and you mark it there.

00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:35.080
And then you see if
they differ in size.

00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:37.940
Or if that doesn't
work, what you do is you

00:49:37.940 --> 00:49:40.560
use various
biochemical techniques.

00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:44.850
You basically make
something akin

00:49:44.850 --> 00:49:48.810
to a thick, homogeneous
soup of something or other.

00:49:48.810 --> 00:49:51.800
And you put the two different
versions of the protein

00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:54.540
in there, and essentially
you sit and wait

00:49:54.540 --> 00:49:57.980
and see how far they sink down.

00:49:57.980 --> 00:50:01.730
And the one that's heavier is
going to sink down further.

00:50:01.730 --> 00:50:05.090
Anyone who knowns about gels
and the electrophoresis,

00:50:05.090 --> 00:50:06.650
that's insanely simplified.

00:50:06.650 --> 00:50:09.020
But that's basically
the notion of it.

00:50:09.020 --> 00:50:10.840
Put them where they
move through something

00:50:10.840 --> 00:50:13.130
as a function of
their weight, gravity,

00:50:13.130 --> 00:50:15.750
and you could then pick
up size differences.

00:50:15.750 --> 00:50:17.410
The other good
question that was asked

00:50:17.410 --> 00:50:20.810
is, What did you just say
in the last 10 minutes?

00:50:20.810 --> 00:50:25.430
This is very difficult. This
is an extremely subtle point.

00:50:25.430 --> 00:50:27.370
And I'm going to hammer
it in over, and over,

00:50:27.370 --> 00:50:29.720
again here, in
sections, all of that.

00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:31.330
Why is it so important?

00:50:31.330 --> 00:50:35.000
Because number one, this
is a number, heritability,

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:37.890
that the general lay
public comes away

00:50:37.890 --> 00:50:40.550
with interpreting
incompletely wrongly.

00:50:40.550 --> 00:50:43.690
And number two, the vast
majority of scientists,

00:50:43.690 --> 00:50:46.500
when they're working in this
field of behavior genetics,

00:50:46.500 --> 00:50:50.390
design their experiments
so that by definition, they

00:50:50.390 --> 00:50:52.780
are eliminating
all sorts of realms

00:50:52.780 --> 00:50:55.710
of environmental influences.

00:50:55.710 --> 00:50:57.440
So going back to this here.

00:50:57.440 --> 00:51:00.620
So here we see once again
this simple question.

00:51:00.620 --> 00:51:04.090
Use this one over and over
translating all this theory

00:51:04.090 --> 00:51:05.750
in variation and stuff.

00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:08.410
Always translates into
the same question.

00:51:08.410 --> 00:51:12.040
I can find out what type,
what version of this gene,

00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:15.580
or I can find out which
environment this is happening.

00:51:15.580 --> 00:51:18.830
Which one do I want to know if I
want to be in a better position

00:51:18.830 --> 00:51:20.420
to guess what's going on?

00:51:20.420 --> 00:51:23.700
And when it looks like this, you
don't want to know the genes.

00:51:23.700 --> 00:51:27.650
You want to know the environment
because it's far more powerful.

00:51:27.650 --> 00:51:30.550
And if you only studied
this in this setting,

00:51:30.550 --> 00:51:34.130
you would come away saying,
Oh, this variability

00:51:34.130 --> 00:51:38.110
is entirely explained by
which version of the gene.

00:51:38.110 --> 00:51:43.670
Oh, this trait, plant IQ,
has 100% heritability.

00:51:43.670 --> 00:51:47.260
And what you see there is
when you combine it together

00:51:47.260 --> 00:51:51.210
with numbers like these,
it's 15% heritability.

00:51:51.210 --> 00:51:55.520
So that's totally
critical to hammer in.

00:51:55.520 --> 00:51:58.110
So what are some of the
responses at that point

00:51:58.110 --> 00:52:00.070
by people who will
say, That's ridiculous.

00:52:00.070 --> 00:52:02.720
If you're saying what
heritability mostly

00:52:02.720 --> 00:52:06.540
should be teaching us is
how unpowerful genes are,

00:52:06.540 --> 00:52:08.970
what would be one of
the initial responses?

00:52:08.970 --> 00:52:09.570
Great.

00:52:09.570 --> 00:52:12.800
How many plants out there are
growing in both the Amazon

00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:14.050
and the Gobi Desert.

00:52:14.050 --> 00:52:16.400
And it's so hard to
study IQ in plants.

00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:20.590
This is a totally artificial
dichotomy between the extremes

00:52:20.590 --> 00:52:22.540
of environment.

00:52:22.540 --> 00:52:24.350
You're like
inflating things now.

00:52:24.350 --> 00:52:26.330
You're cheating in
the other direction

00:52:26.330 --> 00:52:29.770
to get the most dramatic
artificial circumstances

00:52:29.770 --> 00:52:33.340
to inflate your sense of how
important environment is.

00:52:33.340 --> 00:52:36.620
This is totally
artificially dichotomized.

00:52:36.620 --> 00:52:40.820
So think about humans, and think
about one single fact, which

00:52:40.820 --> 00:52:44.060
is we inhabit more
different environments

00:52:44.060 --> 00:52:46.020
than any other species on Earth.

00:52:46.020 --> 00:52:49.400
We live in the Amazon, and
we live in the Gobi Desert.

00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:54.190
And we live in Peoria, and
we live in all these things.

00:52:54.190 --> 00:52:58.110
And we have more exposure
to different sorts

00:52:58.110 --> 00:52:59.310
of environments.

00:52:59.310 --> 00:53:02.640
So immediately, that
argument goes down the drain.

00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:03.390
OK.

00:53:03.390 --> 00:53:06.600
So now instead, somebody
argues something different,

00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:12.480
saying OK, sometimes plants
have IQ in the Amazon

00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:13.530
and in the Gobi Desert.

00:53:13.530 --> 00:53:16.110
And I get your point,
your stupid point here

00:53:16.110 --> 00:53:18.331
that ooh, environment
can make-- No one's going

00:53:18.331 --> 00:53:20.830
to argue that the difference
between the Amazon and the Gobi

00:53:20.830 --> 00:53:22.330
Desert isn't important.

00:53:22.330 --> 00:53:23.180
Oh, yeah, OK.

00:53:23.180 --> 00:53:25.974
Well, humans, they live
in both, all of that.

00:53:25.974 --> 00:53:27.390
It's not an
artificial difference.

00:53:27.390 --> 00:53:29.130
But you notice something?

00:53:29.130 --> 00:53:31.620
Isn't it interesting
that in these two

00:53:31.620 --> 00:53:37.070
different environments, C plants
always have the highest IQ,

00:53:37.070 --> 00:53:39.830
and A plants always
have the lowest.

00:53:39.830 --> 00:53:42.450
That's telling us
something about that gene.

00:53:42.450 --> 00:53:46.550
That's telling us, and you're
then saying well, yes, yes, it

00:53:46.550 --> 00:53:47.760
differs by environment.

00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:51.360
But we've just learned something
very important about these gene

00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:51.950
versions.

00:53:51.950 --> 00:53:54.590
Which is, in totally
different environments,

00:53:54.590 --> 00:53:57.280
version C gives you
a higher plant IQ.

00:53:57.280 --> 00:53:58.820
So that's important.

00:53:58.820 --> 00:53:59.940
Yeah, yeah, environment.

00:53:59.940 --> 00:54:02.840
But we've just seen how
powerful this gene is.

00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:05.840
But then you run into the
person at the conference who

00:54:05.840 --> 00:54:07.360
is studying it in
the Gobi desert,

00:54:07.360 --> 00:54:09.240
and they put their
data up and it's

00:54:09.240 --> 00:54:12.650
even worse than in
the last version

00:54:12.650 --> 00:54:15.160
because it looks like this.

00:54:15.160 --> 00:54:17.590
And what have you just learned?

00:54:17.590 --> 00:54:20.560
That you can't say a
thing about this gene.

00:54:20.560 --> 00:54:23.639
You have just learned the
translation of this sentence.

00:54:23.639 --> 00:54:25.180
The first critical
sentence we've had

00:54:25.180 --> 00:54:26.820
over and over is,
if you can only

00:54:26.820 --> 00:54:28.704
know one factoid,
one about which gene

00:54:28.704 --> 00:54:30.870
version or what environment,
choose the environment,

00:54:30.870 --> 00:54:33.940
we have now just learned
a second sentence.

00:54:33.940 --> 00:54:35.630
A second question to ask.

00:54:35.630 --> 00:54:43.480
Which is, what does having A, B,
or C have to do with plant IQ?

00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:48.450
And if the answer
is "it depends,"

00:54:48.450 --> 00:54:50.320
you've just seen this subtlety.

00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:54.290
If the answer is, "it
depends on which environment

00:54:54.290 --> 00:54:57.520
you're looking at." if
you're looking in the Amazon,

00:54:57.520 --> 00:55:00.180
C gets you the best plant IQ.

00:55:00.180 --> 00:55:02.150
if you're looking
in the Gobi desert,

00:55:02.150 --> 00:55:04.890
C gets you the worst plant IQ.

00:55:04.890 --> 00:55:06.730
What have you just shown?

00:55:06.730 --> 00:55:10.260
What is technically the
definition of a gene

00:55:10.260 --> 00:55:12.830
environment interaction?

00:55:12.830 --> 00:55:15.590
And we've just seen going
from, well yeah, yeah,

00:55:15.590 --> 00:55:17.990
they're very different,
but C is always the best.

00:55:17.990 --> 00:55:19.000
Isn't that interesting?

00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:21.310
To a completely
different profile.

00:55:21.310 --> 00:55:25.200
What does A, B, or C
have to do with plant IQ?

00:55:25.200 --> 00:55:26.320
It depends.

00:55:26.320 --> 00:55:28.230
It depends on the environment.

00:55:28.230 --> 00:55:32.230
That's how you've just
defined, that's your diagnosis,

00:55:32.230 --> 00:55:34.500
for gene environment
interaction.

00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:36.800
And what ultimately
one has to argue

00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:41.140
is that it is impossible to
ever say what a gene does.

00:55:41.140 --> 00:55:44.980
You can only say what a gene
does in the environments which

00:55:44.980 --> 00:55:47.930
to date it has been studied in.

00:55:47.930 --> 00:55:51.100
OK, let's see that
expanding even more.

00:55:51.100 --> 00:55:55.400
Because you've got this--
OK, let's jump ahead.

00:55:55.400 --> 00:55:59.590
OK, so this is showing you
now just how totally nutty

00:55:59.590 --> 00:56:02.940
and counter-intuitive
heritability terms actually

00:56:02.940 --> 00:56:04.090
are.

00:56:04.090 --> 00:56:05.410
You ask a question.

00:56:05.410 --> 00:56:11.436
What's the heritability of
number of fingers on your hand?

00:56:11.436 --> 00:56:13.280
You know, genes have
to do with the fact

00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:15.690
that we've got five fingers
instead of flippers,

00:56:15.690 --> 00:56:16.940
or some such thing.

00:56:16.940 --> 00:56:19.110
Genes have huge
amounts to do with it.

00:56:19.110 --> 00:56:22.510
You're not asking about the
average number of fingers,

00:56:22.510 --> 00:56:24.750
you're asking about
the variability.

00:56:24.750 --> 00:56:26.220
Remember that again.

00:56:26.220 --> 00:56:28.680
So what are the
circumstances out there

00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:32.380
which will give somebody
six fingers instead of five?

00:56:32.380 --> 00:56:33.970
That's incredibly rare.

00:56:33.970 --> 00:56:36.240
What about four fingers
instead of five?

00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:38.240
Oh, industrial accidents.

00:56:38.240 --> 00:56:40.010
Three fingers instead of five?

00:56:40.010 --> 00:56:42.240
Lots of industrial accidents.

00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:43.160
Two?

00:56:43.160 --> 00:56:44.670
Change jobs or whatever.

00:56:44.670 --> 00:56:47.550
What are we seeing
here in terms of,

00:56:47.550 --> 00:56:51.360
how much do genes have
to do with having fewer

00:56:51.360 --> 00:56:52.890
than five fingers?

00:56:52.890 --> 00:56:55.300
It's all industrial accidents.

00:56:55.300 --> 00:56:57.400
Genes have nothing
to do with it.

00:56:57.400 --> 00:57:00.270
There's no doubt some
weirdo disease out there.

00:57:00.270 --> 00:57:02.850
But for our purposes,
this is how it works.

00:57:02.850 --> 00:57:05.250
What have we just discovered?

00:57:05.250 --> 00:57:12.150
Number of fingers, that
trait has a 0% heritability.

00:57:12.150 --> 00:57:13.490
That's totally bizarre.

00:57:13.490 --> 00:57:15.940
That's completely
counter-intuitive.

00:57:15.940 --> 00:57:19.160
Genes have everything to do
with why the average human has

00:57:19.160 --> 00:57:21.130
five fingers, but
they have nothing

00:57:21.130 --> 00:57:23.840
to do with the variability.

00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:26.860
In that case, it's
entirely environmental.

00:57:26.860 --> 00:57:31.880
The number of fingers you
have has 0% heritability.

00:57:31.880 --> 00:57:34.250
Now let's look at
another example.

00:57:34.250 --> 00:57:37.690
It's 1950 in Eisenhower America.

00:57:37.690 --> 00:57:39.750
Actually, it wasn't until 1952.

00:57:39.750 --> 00:57:43.380
But it's a very
different world than now.

00:57:43.380 --> 00:57:46.180
And one of the things that you
would never ever, ever, never,

00:57:46.180 --> 00:57:48.730
never, ever see in
the United States

00:57:48.730 --> 00:57:51.660
would be some guy
wearing an earring.

00:57:51.660 --> 00:57:54.350
Unless in a very cloistered
part of the country

00:57:54.350 --> 00:57:55.990
he was a sensitive guy.

00:57:55.990 --> 00:58:00.250
But for most of America,
this is not what men do.

00:58:00.250 --> 00:58:01.590
They do not wear earrings.

00:58:01.590 --> 00:58:03.240
And likewise, in
most of America,

00:58:03.240 --> 00:58:05.940
if you were a good
red-blooded American woman,

00:58:05.940 --> 00:58:09.170
you would not go outside
without your earrings on.

00:58:09.170 --> 00:58:13.590
So now you've got
to say OK, well

00:58:13.590 --> 00:58:20.520
what causes variability in
earring wearing behavior?

00:58:20.520 --> 00:58:24.480
And it's entirely explained by
whether you are female or male,

00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:26.760
which is a genetic trait.

00:58:26.760 --> 00:58:29.660
What we've just seen
is, whether or not

00:58:29.660 --> 00:58:36.180
you wear earrings in 1952
has 100% heritability.

00:58:36.180 --> 00:58:38.010
Totally counter-intuitive.

00:58:38.010 --> 00:58:40.400
Think through this again
and again and again,

00:58:40.400 --> 00:58:41.880
because this makes sense.

00:58:41.880 --> 00:58:46.380
When heritability is a number
about this rather than this,

00:58:46.380 --> 00:58:49.490
you get a world
where 0% heritability

00:58:49.490 --> 00:58:51.890
for your number of
fingers and 100%

00:58:51.890 --> 00:58:55.970
heritability for whether you are
wearing earrings at that time.

00:58:55.970 --> 00:58:59.710
Because once again,
asking OK, I've

00:58:59.710 --> 00:59:01.090
got a choice in the matter.

00:59:01.090 --> 00:59:04.800
I can either know the entire
genome of this individual,

00:59:04.800 --> 00:59:08.220
or I can know whether
they are in a frat where

00:59:08.220 --> 00:59:11.130
they close their eyes and
work with a wood saw every now

00:59:11.130 --> 00:59:11.700
and then.

00:59:11.700 --> 00:59:13.800
Which fact do I want to know?

00:59:13.800 --> 00:59:16.470
That's the one that will tell
me what about the environment

00:59:16.470 --> 00:59:17.490
going on with them.

00:59:17.490 --> 00:59:19.310
Or now you have a choice.

00:59:19.310 --> 00:59:21.860
I can either know the entire
genome of this person,

00:59:21.860 --> 00:59:26.490
or I can know that what
sort of environment

00:59:26.490 --> 00:59:28.320
they're living in 1952.

00:59:28.320 --> 00:59:31.200
What do you want to know
there is, male or female.

00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:34.740
If I know that, I can
completely predict this behavior

00:59:34.740 --> 00:59:36.560
of earring wearing.

00:59:36.560 --> 00:59:39.620
So this totally
counter-intuitive thing here,

00:59:39.620 --> 00:59:43.010
where heritability is telling
just the opposite of what

00:59:43.010 --> 00:59:44.690
people intuitively think.

00:59:44.690 --> 00:59:46.720
And as soon as
you deal with that

00:59:46.720 --> 00:59:50.190
and recognize that and
recognize the way scientists do

00:59:50.190 --> 00:59:52.380
experiments, is to
try to do things

00:59:52.380 --> 00:59:56.520
as cleanly as possible--
study it only in one place,

00:59:56.520 --> 00:59:59.860
in only one setting, only one
circumstance-- you have just

00:59:59.860 --> 01:00:02.220
artificially
guaranteed that you're

01:00:02.220 --> 01:00:04.220
going to come away more
impressed with the genes

01:00:04.220 --> 01:00:06.810
than they actually
deserve to be.

01:00:06.810 --> 01:00:07.840
So how would this look?

01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:11.700
Beginning now in more detail.

01:00:11.700 --> 01:00:15.210
So what we've got here are
a number of different ways

01:00:15.210 --> 01:00:18.290
in which you can see when
are genes important, when

01:00:18.290 --> 01:00:20.500
are environment important,
that sort of thing.

01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:23.990
OK, so we have here two
different traits-- no,

01:00:23.990 --> 01:00:27.250
we have one trait, two
different flavors of a gene.

01:00:27.250 --> 01:00:32.500
Flavors A and B. And three
different environments.

01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:36.360
So here you have the
Amazon, the Gobi Desert,

01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:37.680
and a roller coaster.

01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:39.292
And you're measuring plant IQ.

01:00:39.292 --> 01:00:41.500
And there's two different
versions of the gene there.

01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:43.520
And you're asking
well, what does

01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:45.830
gene, what to environment
have to do with it?

01:00:45.830 --> 01:00:47.230
Your data look like this.

01:00:47.230 --> 01:00:48.480
What does it tell you?

01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:51.080
Environment makes no
difference at all.

01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:53.720
It doesn't matter if you are
in the desert, the rainforest,

01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:54.410
whatever.

01:00:54.410 --> 01:00:57.700
Which version of the
gene you have entirely

01:00:57.700 --> 01:01:00.650
explains variability.

01:01:00.650 --> 01:01:05.950
So this is what a heritability
of like 100% would look like.

01:01:05.950 --> 01:01:08.220
Now you do the study,
and instead you

01:01:08.220 --> 01:01:11.030
get data like these.

01:01:11.030 --> 01:01:13.450
You'll note just one of
the most important things

01:01:13.450 --> 01:01:15.490
about being a card
carrying scientist, which

01:01:15.490 --> 01:01:17.600
is data are plural.

01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:19.480
Which, talk about
counter-intuitive,

01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:22.140
earrings are genetic
and data are plural.

01:01:22.140 --> 01:01:26.450
So now you get these data
and you see as follows.

01:01:26.450 --> 01:01:28.921
In this environment,
no difference depending

01:01:28.921 --> 01:01:30.170
on what type of gene you have.

01:01:30.170 --> 01:01:32.260
In this environment, no
difference, no difference.

01:01:32.260 --> 01:01:35.360
In each environment,
very different averages.

01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:40.350
Ah, this is what it would look
like with 0% heritability.

01:01:40.350 --> 01:01:43.970
There is no difference at all
of the variation explained

01:01:43.970 --> 01:01:45.360
by gene variation.

01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:48.610
It's all environmental.

01:01:48.610 --> 01:01:51.420
So now we have a
version that forces

01:01:51.420 --> 01:01:54.370
us to put in the same phrase
we heard about before.

01:01:54.370 --> 01:01:57.550
This is what your
data look like now.

01:01:57.550 --> 01:02:01.240
And you now ask
the question, well,

01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:05.200
what does being in environment--
what does your environment have

01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:07.050
to do with your plant IQ?

01:02:07.050 --> 01:02:11.770
And the answer is, it depends
on which version of the gene

01:02:11.770 --> 01:02:13.230
you have.

01:02:13.230 --> 01:02:15.180
And now you ask,
what does having

01:02:15.180 --> 01:02:18.700
a certain version of the gene
have to do with your plant IQ?

01:02:18.700 --> 01:02:23.220
And the answer is, it depends
on which environment you're in.

01:02:23.220 --> 01:02:27.760
This is, in a sense, the verbal
definition, again, of a gene

01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:29.720
environment interaction.

01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:32.290
What do genes have to
do with this trait?

01:02:32.290 --> 01:02:33.416
Depends on the environment.

01:02:33.416 --> 01:02:35.331
What does environment
have to do with a trait?

01:02:35.331 --> 01:02:36.710
It depends on the type of genes.

01:02:36.710 --> 01:02:38.850
This is what the
data would look like.

01:02:38.850 --> 01:02:41.134
And here you have
an interaction.

01:02:41.134 --> 01:02:44.110
And in some fudging
of the numbers,

01:02:44.110 --> 01:02:47.490
this is what 50%
heritability would look like.

01:02:47.490 --> 01:02:51.410
What we just saw here before,
our hypothetical example

01:02:51.410 --> 01:02:53.910
of the messiest
it could get, this

01:02:53.910 --> 01:02:56.470
is the one where the people come
back and say, yes, yes, yes,

01:02:56.470 --> 01:02:57.370
environment matters.

01:02:57.370 --> 01:02:59.820
But you notice
version C is always

01:02:59.820 --> 01:03:01.680
associated with the highest IQ.

01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:03.490
And here we have
the version where

01:03:03.490 --> 01:03:06.150
depending on the setting, if
you have this type of gene,

01:03:06.150 --> 01:03:07.210
it gets better.

01:03:07.210 --> 01:03:09.850
If you have this type
of gene, it gets worse.

01:03:09.850 --> 01:03:12.930
This is one where there's
a dramatic interaction

01:03:12.930 --> 01:03:15.700
between what the genes
are doing and what

01:03:15.700 --> 01:03:17.090
the environment is doing.

01:03:17.090 --> 01:03:19.940
This is one that's going to
have an even lower heritability

01:03:19.940 --> 01:03:24.210
because this is one where
you are saying big time,

01:03:24.210 --> 01:03:25.200
it depends.

01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:26.750
It depends on what
the gene type is.

01:03:26.750 --> 01:03:27.470
It depends.

01:03:27.470 --> 01:03:29.170
It depends on what
the environment is.

01:03:29.170 --> 01:03:30.870
This is, in a sense,
as dramatically

01:03:30.870 --> 01:03:32.730
as it could be that case.

01:03:32.730 --> 01:03:36.390
So you constantly have
stuff like this going on.

01:03:36.390 --> 01:03:39.420
Let's look at an example
where, in fact, you wind up

01:03:39.420 --> 01:03:41.070
seeing something like this.

01:03:41.070 --> 01:03:46.140
Back to our iconic mutation
disease from the other day

01:03:46.140 --> 01:03:47.430
there, PKU.

01:03:47.430 --> 01:03:48.690
Phenylketonuria.

01:03:48.690 --> 01:03:51.430
Just to remind you, do not
worry about the details.

01:03:51.430 --> 01:03:55.870
It's this disease where normally
there's this thing in your body

01:03:55.870 --> 01:03:57.720
which would be
toxic to your brain

01:03:57.720 --> 01:04:01.060
unless it's turned
into something else.

01:04:01.060 --> 01:04:04.540
And this is the
enzyme-- the protein,

01:04:04.540 --> 01:04:06.310
and thus coded for
by a gene-- this

01:04:06.310 --> 01:04:08.540
is the enzyme that
turns the scary version

01:04:08.540 --> 01:04:09.720
into the safe version.

01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:13.100
And in PKU, you have a
mutation in this enzyme,

01:04:13.100 --> 01:04:14.520
it's not doing its job.

01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:18.950
The scary version builds up and
wipes out your nervous system.

01:04:18.950 --> 01:04:20.300
That looks bad.

01:04:20.300 --> 01:04:23.440
And what we've got now
is a trait where you're

01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:26.490
going to say, well, let's see.

01:04:26.490 --> 01:04:29.640
I am very interested
in knowing, being

01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:33.060
able to predict whether or not
this person has a fairly normal

01:04:33.060 --> 01:04:35.640
looking brain or whether
it looks like Swiss cheese.

01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:38.010
Do I want to know whether
or not they're growing up

01:04:38.010 --> 01:04:40.649
in Idaho versus Montana?

01:04:40.649 --> 01:04:42.440
Or do I want to know
whether or not they've

01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:44.697
got a mutation in this enzyme?

01:04:44.697 --> 01:04:46.280
Obviously, you want
to know if there's

01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:47.600
a mutation in the enzyme.

01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:50.740
Seemingly, heritability is 100%.

01:04:50.740 --> 01:04:52.890
But now you do
something which people

01:04:52.890 --> 01:04:55.960
have been doing for people with
PKU for a couple of decades

01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:56.460
now.

01:04:56.460 --> 01:05:01.390
Which is, you put little labels
on bottles of food and stuff

01:05:01.390 --> 01:05:06.580
saying, if this food contains
the scary bad news thing.

01:05:06.580 --> 01:05:09.640
And if you have
PKU, if you simply

01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:13.910
don't eat food that contains
that-- if you have what's

01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:16.840
called a fennel
alanine free diet--

01:05:16.840 --> 01:05:19.960
you don't get your brain
looking like Swiss cheese.

01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:21.320
What have you got there?

01:05:21.320 --> 01:05:24.220
You've just put in an
environmental influence

01:05:24.220 --> 01:05:27.720
that has reduced
heritability down to zero.

01:05:27.720 --> 01:05:31.520
This is a case where we've got
something like this looking.

01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:34.850
And here we're measuring is,
like, the Swiss cheese index,

01:05:34.850 --> 01:05:36.210
or whatever of the brain.

01:05:36.210 --> 01:05:40.350
And what we've got here is, this
is an environment where people

01:05:40.350 --> 01:05:44.190
know how much of the stuff there
is in different types of food

01:05:44.190 --> 01:05:45.440
and don't eat it.

01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:47.960
A simple environmental--
not so simple--

01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:50.050
but an environmental
intervention.

01:05:50.050 --> 01:05:52.900
A behavioral change
in the environment.

01:05:52.900 --> 01:05:56.760
And you've just reduced
heritability from 100% to 0%.

01:05:56.760 --> 01:05:59.160
So that is a dramatic version.

01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:04.010
Now, let's look at a version
of a real life example of this.

01:06:04.010 --> 01:06:08.960
This would be with-- I think
I've already put this one up.

01:06:21.194 --> 01:06:24.630
OK, does this work
familiar by now?

01:06:24.630 --> 01:06:25.500
No.

01:06:25.500 --> 01:06:26.950
OK, that was at Thanksgiving.

01:06:26.950 --> 01:06:27.450
OK.

01:06:27.450 --> 01:06:31.200
What we've got here is a
gene that's got something

01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:32.220
to do with depression.

01:06:32.220 --> 01:06:34.670
It's a gene that has something
to do with neurotransmitter

01:06:34.670 --> 01:06:35.800
serotonin.

01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:38.010
Details don't matter,
they will come later.

01:06:38.010 --> 01:06:40.780
But the gene comes in
two different flavors.

01:06:40.780 --> 01:06:43.510
And one version of it,
based on everything

01:06:43.510 --> 01:06:45.700
that's known from
laboratory animals,

01:06:45.700 --> 01:06:48.810
one version should be
the kind that predisposes

01:06:48.810 --> 01:06:51.240
you more towards depression.

01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:54.680
So, in this incredibly
important study

01:06:54.680 --> 01:06:56.390
that was done a
number of years ago,

01:06:56.390 --> 01:06:59.190
a guy named Caspi, Duke
University, and colleagues,

01:06:59.190 --> 01:07:04.000
they had been studying 17,000
people basically from birth

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.670
up to age 25 or
so in New Zealand.

01:07:06.670 --> 01:07:08.200
And who knows why
in New Zealand,

01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:11.310
but studying them there,
and following and asking.

01:07:11.310 --> 01:07:14.180
They took blood so they know
the whole genetic profiles.

01:07:14.180 --> 01:07:17.330
And looking at, among
other things, by age 25,

01:07:17.330 --> 01:07:19.540
does the person have
major depression or not.

01:07:19.540 --> 01:07:22.370
Have they had an
episode of depression.

01:07:22.370 --> 01:07:26.420
And now let's go look at which
version of this gene they have.

01:07:26.420 --> 01:07:28.640
And what would everything
predict from all the animal

01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:31.770
studies, which is you have
the bad version of the gene

01:07:31.770 --> 01:07:34.930
and you're, as a human,
going to have a higher

01:07:34.930 --> 01:07:37.320
chance of having a depression.

01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:39.340
That's not what the
data looked like.

01:07:39.340 --> 01:07:43.170
Instead, it was one
of those "it depends."

01:07:43.170 --> 01:07:46.090
It depends on the environment.

01:07:46.090 --> 01:07:48.510
What you saw was,
it all depended

01:07:48.510 --> 01:07:54.220
on how many major childhood
stressors there were.

01:07:54.220 --> 01:07:57.680
Loss of a parent, divorce,
abuse, some such thing.

01:07:57.680 --> 01:08:00.700
And the absence of
any of those, this

01:08:00.700 --> 01:08:02.670
was the rate of depression
in the people having

01:08:02.670 --> 01:08:03.980
the good version.

01:08:03.980 --> 01:08:06.820
And throw in one childhood
trauma, two of them,

01:08:06.820 --> 01:08:10.690
three of them, and the
incidence is going up slightly.

01:08:10.690 --> 01:08:13.540
Now, you've got the bad
version of the gene.

01:08:13.540 --> 01:08:16.630
And it puts you
more at risk only

01:08:16.630 --> 01:08:19.010
in certain types
of environments.

01:08:19.010 --> 01:08:22.330
So here we have a great gene
environment interaction.

01:08:22.330 --> 01:08:24.130
That's something
straight out of this one.

01:08:24.130 --> 01:08:25.935
You're saying well,
what does this gene

01:08:25.935 --> 01:08:27.560
have to do with the
risk of depression?

01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:29.510
And the answer is, it depends.

01:08:29.510 --> 01:08:32.710
It depends on what your
childhood environment was like.

01:08:32.710 --> 01:08:35.779
But now, one additional detail
showing that this is actually

01:08:35.779 --> 01:08:36.810
a case of this.

01:08:36.810 --> 01:08:38.830
One that just gets
ignored whenever

01:08:38.830 --> 01:08:41.620
people talk about the
study because it's cool,

01:08:41.620 --> 01:08:43.542
but it's actually not
all that important.

01:08:43.542 --> 01:08:46.000
OK, so here's the people with
the good version of the gene,

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:47.292
but it makes this point though.

01:08:47.292 --> 01:08:49.416
You've got the good version,
and they're down here.

01:08:49.416 --> 01:08:50.920
And you know what's
going to happen,

01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:52.919
the bad version is going
to be exactly the same.

01:08:52.919 --> 01:08:57.800
But you look at the data
closely, and in the absence,

01:08:57.800 --> 01:09:01.370
the bad version is actually
a little bit protective

01:09:01.370 --> 01:09:04.290
from depression versus
the quote "good version."

01:09:04.290 --> 01:09:06.140
What have you just
discovered there?

01:09:06.140 --> 01:09:07.859
It's one of these.

01:09:07.859 --> 01:09:10.840
This is a radical gene
environment interaction.

01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:14.797
Not only is it the case that,
does this put you more at risk?

01:09:14.797 --> 01:09:16.380
Well, that depends
on the environment.

01:09:16.380 --> 01:09:19.591
Depending on your environment,
it could put you less at risk.

01:09:19.591 --> 01:09:21.340
This one is not a big
deal because there's

01:09:21.340 --> 01:09:22.914
a tiny difference.

01:09:22.914 --> 01:09:24.330
There's no reason
to pay attention

01:09:24.330 --> 01:09:27.580
to it, other than just sort of
pointing it out pedagogically.

01:09:27.580 --> 01:09:31.149
But this is an amazing
example where this can

01:09:31.149 --> 01:09:33.140
go in the opposite direction.

01:09:33.140 --> 01:09:37.560
This is a hugely important
gene environment interaction.

01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:40.930
So what all of this begins
to set you up for is,

01:09:40.930 --> 01:09:43.800
you've forgot this
heritability number.

01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:46.350
And people come away
constantly thinking about,

01:09:46.350 --> 01:09:49.859
it's telling you about how much
the average level of a trait

01:09:49.859 --> 01:09:51.250
is determined by genes.

01:09:51.250 --> 01:09:54.109
It's instead telling you
how much the variability.

01:09:54.109 --> 01:09:57.320
What that means, thus, by
definition, that there's

01:09:57.320 --> 01:10:00.260
all sorts of nutty
counter-intuitive things going

01:10:00.260 --> 01:10:03.610
on, where earrings are totally
heritable and number of fingers

01:10:03.610 --> 01:10:04.485
are not.

01:10:04.485 --> 01:10:09.070
What that tells you is, by
definition, the way experiments

01:10:09.070 --> 01:10:12.510
are set up to make things nice
and clean and interpretable,

01:10:12.510 --> 01:10:16.780
scientists typically remove
environmental variability.

01:10:16.780 --> 01:10:19.430
Scientists typically
artificially

01:10:19.430 --> 01:10:24.470
have boosted up the seeming
heritability of a trait.

01:10:24.470 --> 01:10:26.160
What does that tell you?

01:10:26.160 --> 01:10:30.220
The more different environments
you study a trait in,

01:10:30.220 --> 01:10:32.860
the lower the heritability
is going to be.

01:10:32.860 --> 01:10:34.880
Because you are
going to be getting

01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:38.940
more and more opportunities
for things to be different.

01:10:38.940 --> 01:10:42.590
More opportunities to be
able to say, it depends.

01:10:42.590 --> 01:10:44.670
It depends on which environment.

01:10:44.670 --> 01:10:47.660
We've just studied it in
99 different environments,

01:10:47.660 --> 01:10:49.730
and it always looks like this.

01:10:49.730 --> 01:10:51.680
No difference by
environment, and genes

01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:53.150
always make a huge difference.

01:10:53.150 --> 01:10:56.330
And then you go out and,
before dying of fatigue,

01:10:56.330 --> 01:10:58.500
you study it in the
hundredth environment,

01:10:58.500 --> 01:11:01.320
and it now looks like
this sort of thing.

01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:05.895
What you've just learned is,
this is a "it depends" example.

01:11:05.895 --> 01:11:09.150
And the more environments
you study something in,

01:11:09.150 --> 01:11:11.840
the lower heritability
is going to be.

01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:14.940
Translating that into
English, the more environments

01:11:14.940 --> 01:11:18.010
you study a genetically
influenced trait,

01:11:18.010 --> 01:11:20.230
the less interesting
and important

01:11:20.230 --> 01:11:22.152
the genes are going to be.

01:11:22.152 --> 01:11:23.800
The less interesting
and important

01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:25.910
they're going to
be in answering,

01:11:25.910 --> 01:11:28.402
what does this gene have
to do with whatever?

01:11:28.402 --> 01:11:30.110
And what we're seeing
over and over again

01:11:30.110 --> 01:11:32.400
is, the only way to answer
it over and over again

01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:34.110
is, it's going to
be an "it depends."

01:11:34.110 --> 01:11:35.510
It depends on the environment.

01:11:35.510 --> 01:11:38.960
Ultimately-- as I said a
little while ago-- ultimately,

01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:43.530
it winds up being meaningless
to ask what a gene does.

01:11:43.530 --> 01:11:47.070
Ultimately, the only
really truly scientific way

01:11:47.070 --> 01:11:48.760
you can answer a
question like that

01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:54.120
is, what does this gene do in
this particular environment?

01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:57.057
People make this big deal out
of oh, genes do something,

01:11:57.057 --> 01:11:58.140
environments do something.

01:11:58.140 --> 01:12:00.920
And every now and
then, hooray, they

01:12:00.920 --> 01:12:04.640
interact in some exciting way
in teaching the gene environment

01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:06.660
interaction cliche,
that's what's

01:12:06.660 --> 01:12:08.640
happening every single time.

01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:11.130
And that winds up
being the basis of that

01:12:11.130 --> 01:12:13.580
quote from Paul Ehrlich
in this department

01:12:13.580 --> 01:12:16.120
that I put on the
handout, which is great,

01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:20.790
summarizes this entire
point, asking whether genes

01:12:20.790 --> 01:12:23.580
or environment have more
to do with some trait

01:12:23.580 --> 01:12:26.720
is akin to asking whether
height or length have more

01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:28.950
to do with the volume
of a rectangle.

01:12:28.950 --> 01:12:30.630
They're inseparable.

01:12:30.630 --> 01:12:33.430
There is no such thing
as a gene influence

01:12:33.430 --> 01:12:37.970
outside the context of an
environmental interaction.

01:12:37.970 --> 01:12:38.900
OK.

01:12:38.900 --> 01:12:41.390
Let's look more at
what this looks like.

01:12:41.390 --> 01:12:43.740
Here, this being
one great example.

01:12:43.740 --> 01:12:45.900
And this being this iconic one.

01:12:45.900 --> 01:12:50.520
And this is a finding that
is destined to be, like,

01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:52.390
the most important
in the last quarter

01:12:52.390 --> 01:12:54.640
century in biological
psychiatry.

01:12:54.640 --> 01:12:57.330
It is the most
powerful demonstration

01:12:57.330 --> 01:13:03.200
in the realm of abnormal human
behavior of what your genotype

01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:04.830
has to do with your behavior.

01:13:04.830 --> 01:13:08.700
The most amazing, logical,
intuitively reasonable

01:13:08.700 --> 01:13:11.310
demonstration of "it depends."

01:13:11.310 --> 01:13:14.900
It depends on how stressful
the childhood environment was.

01:13:14.900 --> 01:13:16.500
Really great.

01:13:16.500 --> 01:13:18.220
Bringing things
back to last weeks

01:13:18.220 --> 01:13:20.900
sort of molecular
lectures, people already

01:13:20.900 --> 01:13:22.550
know who study this.

01:13:22.550 --> 01:13:26.150
The two different versions
of the gene, certain classes

01:13:26.150 --> 01:13:31.540
of stress hormones interact with
the two versions differently.

01:13:31.540 --> 01:13:35.070
When stress hormone levels
aren't particularly raised,

01:13:35.070 --> 01:13:37.910
that difference isn't
being manifested.

01:13:37.910 --> 01:13:40.210
The more of a history
of stress-- and it's

01:13:40.210 --> 01:13:42.890
obviously more mechanical,
more complicated

01:13:42.890 --> 01:13:46.650
than just how much you're
exposed to-- but the promoters,

01:13:46.650 --> 01:13:49.380
the variation here
is in the promoters.

01:13:49.380 --> 01:13:51.760
The promoters
interact differently

01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:54.730
with those glucocorticoid
stress hormones.

01:13:54.730 --> 01:13:57.020
In the absence of the
glucocorticoid stress hormones,

01:13:57.020 --> 01:14:00.110
because in the absence
of something exciting,

01:14:00.110 --> 01:14:03.700
your genetic difference
makes no difference.

01:14:03.700 --> 01:14:07.872
So we've just translated
an epidemiological answer--

01:14:07.872 --> 01:14:09.830
what does this gene have
to do with depression?

01:14:09.830 --> 01:14:11.010
It depends.

01:14:11.010 --> 01:14:13.930
It depends on your
childhood stress history.

01:14:13.930 --> 01:14:17.797
We've just translated that into
last week's molecular biology,

01:14:17.797 --> 01:14:20.380
what does this genetic variance
have to do with whether or not

01:14:20.380 --> 01:14:21.213
you have depression?

01:14:21.213 --> 01:14:22.540
It depends.

01:14:22.540 --> 01:14:26.730
It depends on how much childhood
exposure to glucocorticoids

01:14:26.730 --> 01:14:27.710
you had.

01:14:27.710 --> 01:14:30.530
So we've just leaped
from analyzing this

01:14:30.530 --> 01:14:33.260
in the context of this
field, to translating that

01:14:33.260 --> 01:14:34.780
into last week.

01:14:34.780 --> 01:14:36.720
And translating that
into the endocrine

01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:40.390
lectures that are going to come
next week, beginning to show,

01:14:40.390 --> 01:14:42.150
OK, you're an epidemiologist.

01:14:42.150 --> 01:14:45.077
The answer is, what
sort of environment?

01:14:45.077 --> 01:14:46.160
You're an endocrinologist.

01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:49.690
The answer is, well, the
hormonal environment.

01:14:49.690 --> 01:14:52.570
Whether you define it,
it's the same punch line.

01:14:52.570 --> 01:14:53.830
It depends.

01:14:53.830 --> 01:14:55.950
It depends on the environment.

01:14:55.950 --> 01:14:59.320
So this is the best,
most amazing example

01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:01.040
of this in all of psychiatry.

01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:04.400
Except, these guys--
Caspian colleagues--

01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:07.380
measured something
else and they got just

01:15:07.380 --> 01:15:09.760
as bestest of an
answer for that.

01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:13.790
Which is, they looked at
another gene that has variation.

01:15:13.790 --> 01:15:15.840
One we will hear
about down the line.

01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:19.270
A gene called MAO,
monoamine oxidase.

01:15:19.270 --> 01:15:23.320
All we need to know right now
is, a gazillion animal studies

01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:26.420
suggest that one
version of the gene

01:15:26.420 --> 01:15:30.420
predisposes more towards
aggression than the other.

01:15:30.420 --> 01:15:31.320
Whoa.

01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:34.070
So they've got
17,000 people who've

01:15:34.070 --> 01:15:36.350
just had 25 years
worth of opportunity

01:15:36.350 --> 01:15:38.560
to be aggressive or not,
and they got the genes.

01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:42.750
And now they ask the question,
rather than at age 25,

01:15:42.750 --> 01:15:45.300
has this person ever had a
major clinical depression?

01:15:45.300 --> 01:15:48.520
Now they ask, at age
25, has this person ever

01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:50.560
been in trouble with
the law for some sort

01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:53.030
of antisocial behavior?

01:15:53.030 --> 01:15:55.180
Antisocial behavior
is the new jargon

01:15:55.180 --> 01:15:58.550
for what used to be called
sociopathic behavior.

01:15:58.550 --> 01:16:01.220
Has this person been
in trouble with the law

01:16:01.220 --> 01:16:03.640
for sociopathic
behavior, anti-social.

01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:07.670
And does it vary depending on
which version of the MAO gene

01:16:07.670 --> 01:16:08.300
you have?

01:16:08.300 --> 01:16:11.170
And what you get is,
not only is the answer

01:16:11.170 --> 01:16:14.690
"it depends," the
graph is basically

01:16:14.690 --> 01:16:16.460
identical to this one.

01:16:16.460 --> 01:16:19.280
It's superimposable, the
magnitude of the effect.

01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:21.920
What was this in that case?

01:16:21.920 --> 01:16:26.280
Whether or not you had, and how
severe your child history was,

01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:27.580
of abuse.

01:16:27.580 --> 01:16:30.330
The more childhood
abuse you had, the more

01:16:30.330 --> 01:16:32.930
having the wrong
version of the gene

01:16:32.930 --> 01:16:35.870
increased your odds of
having anti-social aggressive

01:16:35.870 --> 01:16:37.290
behavior.

01:16:37.290 --> 01:16:41.240
Once again, a major
dramatic "it depends."

01:16:41.240 --> 01:16:42.345
And it's stunning.

01:16:42.345 --> 01:16:43.970
You look at these
two different papers,

01:16:43.970 --> 01:16:47.190
both were published in
"Science" a couple years apart.

01:16:47.190 --> 01:16:48.940
Landmark studies, all of that.

01:16:48.940 --> 01:16:52.580
And the two graphs really
are virtually superimposable.

01:16:52.580 --> 01:16:54.380
The same magnitude of effects.

01:16:54.380 --> 01:16:55.810
The same answer.

01:16:55.810 --> 01:16:58.340
It depends on your childhood.

01:16:58.340 --> 01:17:00.520
So that is a very
strong example.

01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:05.570
Next one, another one, now you
go back to this gene difference

01:17:05.570 --> 01:17:07.920
with the serotonin,
the depression world.

01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:11.640
And now you study it in monkeys
and the variation there,

01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:14.930
there is a variation in
brain chemistry related

01:17:14.930 --> 01:17:16.940
to depression, all
of that depending

01:17:16.940 --> 01:17:20.690
on how stressful the
monkey's childhood was.

01:17:20.690 --> 01:17:23.100
Same exact sort of finding.

01:17:23.100 --> 01:17:24.180
What else?

01:17:24.180 --> 01:17:26.560
Now when you begin to
look at-- going back

01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:30.760
to that world of dopamine
receptors and thrill

01:17:30.760 --> 01:17:34.290
seeking and all of that--
and what you look at

01:17:34.290 --> 01:17:37.100
there is variability
in a certain type

01:17:37.100 --> 01:17:39.580
of different dopamine
receptor gene.

01:17:39.580 --> 01:17:41.780
And what you find
there is, if you

01:17:41.780 --> 01:17:44.020
have a certain
version of that gene,

01:17:44.020 --> 01:17:46.850
you have less social attachment.

01:17:46.850 --> 01:17:50.090
There's a whole psychology
of how you measure that.

01:17:50.090 --> 01:17:51.130
And God knows why.

01:17:51.130 --> 01:17:54.640
It's associated with
less social attachment

01:17:54.640 --> 01:17:57.700
if, and only if,
you got brought up

01:17:57.700 --> 01:18:01.030
by a mother who was
cold and withdrawn.

01:18:01.030 --> 01:18:03.720
There is once again
a "it depends."

01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:06.690
My looking at that, it's
nowhere near as clean as this.

01:18:06.690 --> 01:18:09.210
But it's the same
sort of theme again.

01:18:09.210 --> 01:18:10.940
Another example of it.

01:18:10.940 --> 01:18:14.160
There's another
gene called FAD2.

01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:16.120
And don't even ask me
what it stands for.

01:18:16.120 --> 01:18:20.230
But which version
of the gene you have

01:18:20.230 --> 01:18:24.006
has some predictability
over your IQ.

01:18:24.006 --> 01:18:25.130
That's kind of interesting.

01:18:25.130 --> 01:18:27.690
It's not a big effect, but
nonetheless it is demonstrable.

01:18:27.690 --> 01:18:30.800
Which version of the gene
you have has some control,

01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:33.100
but there's a "it depends."

01:18:33.100 --> 01:18:35.890
Which version of
that gene you have

01:18:35.890 --> 01:18:40.760
has something to do with IQ
if and only if something.

01:18:40.760 --> 01:18:43.880
Let me tell you what
this FAD2 is involved in.

01:18:43.880 --> 01:18:48.520
It is involved in
carbohydrate metabolism.

01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:52.130
Carbohydrates-- carbs,
carbohydrate metabolism-- it

01:18:52.130 --> 01:18:54.690
codes for some enzyme
that breaks down

01:18:54.690 --> 01:18:57.850
carbohydrates and no
doubt, some certain kind.

01:18:57.850 --> 01:18:58.730
OK.

01:18:58.730 --> 01:19:00.180
What's going on here?

01:19:00.180 --> 01:19:01.770
You've got two
different versions

01:19:01.770 --> 01:19:05.330
of a gene that break
down carbohydrates,

01:19:05.330 --> 01:19:06.850
and you've got one version.

01:19:06.850 --> 01:19:10.310
And on the average, you'll
have a higher IQ if and only

01:19:10.310 --> 01:19:12.770
if some environmental
thing was happening.

01:19:12.770 --> 01:19:15.690
Any guesses what that
environmental thing might be?

01:19:20.180 --> 01:19:21.680
High carbohydrate diet.

01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:23.540
High carbohydrate diet, OK.

01:19:23.540 --> 01:19:25.970
That makes tons of
sense, yes indeed.

01:19:25.970 --> 01:19:27.700
That winds up being relevant.

01:19:27.700 --> 01:19:30.010
Remember, you're
now-- not remember,

01:19:30.010 --> 01:19:31.520
because I didn't
say it already--

01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:33.270
but you're looking
at IQ in kids.

01:19:33.270 --> 01:19:36.760
So you're looking now
at carbohydrate stuff

01:19:36.760 --> 01:19:38.060
going on early in life.

01:19:38.060 --> 01:19:39.850
So frame it in that context.

01:19:39.850 --> 01:19:41.800
So, we've got a start
of an answer here.

01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:43.500
So what else could be happening?

01:19:43.500 --> 01:19:46.620
If and only if the
version you have

01:19:46.620 --> 01:19:50.430
of this gene that's involved
in breaking down carbohydrates,

01:19:50.430 --> 01:19:52.990
translating into
how you're dealing

01:19:52.990 --> 01:19:55.090
with the amount of
carbohydrates in your diet,

01:19:55.090 --> 01:19:58.970
gets you a different IQ
with an if and only if.

01:19:58.970 --> 01:20:01.050
What would the if
and only if be?

01:20:01.050 --> 01:20:03.830
Build on that comment there.

01:20:03.830 --> 01:20:05.206
What else could it be?

01:20:09.800 --> 01:20:12.790
OK, I'm not even going to look.

01:20:12.790 --> 01:20:16.295
Somebody shout out an answer.

01:20:16.295 --> 01:20:17.440
[INAUDIBLE]

01:20:17.440 --> 01:20:18.100
You're right!

01:20:18.100 --> 01:20:19.600
OK, Who started?

01:20:19.600 --> 01:20:21.410
Somebody started
saying something.

01:20:21.410 --> 01:20:23.100
Who started saying something?

01:20:23.100 --> 01:20:24.390
OK.

01:20:24.390 --> 01:20:25.900
Any other ideas?

01:20:25.900 --> 01:20:27.230
Breast feeding.

01:20:27.230 --> 01:20:29.560
Who said that?

01:20:29.560 --> 01:20:31.190
Look at that, they
start pointing.

01:20:31.190 --> 01:20:32.890
The person doesn't even fess up.

01:20:32.890 --> 01:20:33.745
Who said that?

01:20:33.745 --> 01:20:34.900
It's in your notes.

01:20:34.900 --> 01:20:35.850
You're right.

01:20:35.850 --> 01:20:39.250
[LAUGHTER]

01:20:39.250 --> 01:20:40.214
OK.

01:20:40.214 --> 01:20:41.696
You want to be that way.

01:20:44.660 --> 01:20:48.010
I'm out of here.

01:20:48.010 --> 01:20:48.800
OK.

01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:54.230
So if and only if you read the
damn notes, as it turns out.

01:20:54.230 --> 01:20:55.060
Yes!

01:20:55.060 --> 01:20:55.990
Breastfeeding.

01:20:55.990 --> 01:20:57.180
OK.

01:20:57.180 --> 01:21:00.560
If and only if you were having
a particular type of diet

01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:02.790
very early in life
that is extremely

01:21:02.790 --> 01:21:05.890
rich in the types
of carbohydrates

01:21:05.890 --> 01:21:07.910
that this enzyme works on.

01:21:07.910 --> 01:21:10.820
So a very dramatic
if and only if there.

01:21:10.820 --> 01:21:12.567
I don't know why I
write that stuff.

01:21:12.567 --> 01:21:13.900
I don't know why I show up here.

01:21:13.900 --> 01:21:15.316
I should be doing
one or the other

01:21:15.316 --> 01:21:18.250
and some sort of environment
interaction thing.

01:21:18.250 --> 01:21:19.840
So yeah, breastfeeding.

01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:20.420
OK.

01:21:20.420 --> 01:21:23.770
So one more example, a
very interesting one.

01:21:23.770 --> 01:21:26.750
And this is one that has at
some point or other, I'd bet,

01:21:26.750 --> 01:21:29.500
been pertinent to every
single person in this room.

01:21:29.500 --> 01:21:32.310
Which is, there's another
genetic difference

01:21:32.310 --> 01:21:36.240
that has something to do with
a certain cognitive aptitude.

01:21:36.240 --> 01:21:38.780
And this one
everybody knows about.

01:21:38.780 --> 01:21:41.300
And this one is as follows.

01:21:41.300 --> 01:21:44.610
If you have-- there's two
different versions of this sort

01:21:44.610 --> 01:21:48.290
of genetic picture
and they're associated

01:21:48.290 --> 01:21:50.300
with different
levels of aptitude

01:21:50.300 --> 01:21:52.010
in this particular
cognitive realm--

01:21:52.010 --> 01:21:55.800
this is not a world any more
of one single gene at a time.

01:21:55.800 --> 01:21:57.455
FAD2, any of these.

01:21:57.455 --> 01:22:00.020
This instead is talking
about a whole bunch of genes.

01:22:00.020 --> 01:22:04.130
If you have a Y
chromosome or not.

01:22:04.130 --> 01:22:06.330
If you are male or female.

01:22:06.330 --> 01:22:07.810
A genetic trait.

01:22:07.810 --> 01:22:10.150
And what is the thing
that has been demonstrated

01:22:10.150 --> 01:22:12.080
most consistently
in the literature

01:22:12.080 --> 01:22:14.120
forever and ever
and ever in terms

01:22:14.120 --> 01:22:17.580
of a gender difference in
a cognitive skill in math

01:22:17.580 --> 01:22:18.840
performance.

01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:20.530
That has come through endlessly.

01:22:20.530 --> 01:22:22.790
I've already talked
about it the other week.

01:22:22.790 --> 01:22:26.090
A small difference in the
average median performance

01:22:26.090 --> 01:22:29.520
on junior high school
old Johns Hopkins

01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:32.410
superstar kids taking the SATs.

01:22:32.410 --> 01:22:35.330
But a big difference in the tail
at the end, high performance,

01:22:35.330 --> 01:22:36.120
all of that.

01:22:36.120 --> 01:22:39.090
This comes up in
endless, endless studies.

01:22:39.090 --> 01:22:42.200
This comes up with kids
at fairly young ages.

01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:45.420
There is this gender difference
on the average-- yes, we're

01:22:45.420 --> 01:22:48.220
saying on the average, don't
forget, you say on the average

01:22:48.220 --> 01:22:50.910
before you even ignore that--
you say on the average,

01:22:50.910 --> 01:22:53.630
boys are better at
math than girls.

01:22:53.630 --> 01:22:55.760
Men are better at
math than women.

01:22:55.760 --> 01:22:58.810
Male plants in the
Gobi desert are better

01:22:58.810 --> 01:23:00.990
in math than female
plants there.

01:23:00.990 --> 01:23:03.830
And so we've got a
genetic trait here

01:23:03.830 --> 01:23:08.100
being a function of whether
or not you get a Y chromosome.

01:23:08.100 --> 01:23:12.560
But then, a few years ago there
was an astonishingly important

01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:14.710
paper published in "Science."

01:23:14.710 --> 01:23:17.940
And what these people did
was look at math performance

01:23:17.940 --> 01:23:22.960
scores-- of I think it was
480,000 different high school

01:23:22.960 --> 01:23:24.130
kids.

01:23:24.130 --> 01:23:27.240
And all over the world.

01:23:27.240 --> 01:23:29.010
They didn't just
study it in America.

01:23:29.010 --> 01:23:32.740
They studied it in 40
different countries.

01:23:32.740 --> 01:23:35.340
And they asked a
very simple question.

01:23:35.340 --> 01:23:40.440
Which is, are there big
differences in gender quality

01:23:40.440 --> 01:23:42.630
of life issues in this country?

01:23:42.630 --> 01:23:47.370
And there is a whole index that
comes out of the World Health

01:23:47.370 --> 01:23:50.750
UN something or other called
a gender equality index.

01:23:50.750 --> 01:23:53.422
Which takes into account,
like, if there is--

01:23:53.422 --> 01:23:55.670
and if there is, how
dramatic of-- a gender

01:23:55.670 --> 01:23:59.010
difference in educational
opportunities,

01:23:59.010 --> 01:24:02.500
in freedom of movement, in
freedom to serve in an elected

01:24:02.500 --> 01:24:06.170
office, and freedom to vote,
in freedom to choose who you're

01:24:06.170 --> 01:24:10.180
married to, and obviously
the enormous variability

01:24:10.180 --> 01:24:12.250
on this planet in terms of that.

01:24:12.250 --> 01:24:17.390
And what they showed was,
the greater the inadequacies,

01:24:17.390 --> 01:24:20.590
the greater the difference
in gender treatment

01:24:20.590 --> 01:24:23.470
in the society across
40 different countries,

01:24:23.470 --> 01:24:27.790
the bigger the difference
there was in math scores.

01:24:27.790 --> 01:24:29.940
It's not a function
of gender, it's

01:24:29.940 --> 01:24:33.260
which society you're
growing up with your gender.

01:24:33.260 --> 01:24:34.660
What was at the most extreme?

01:24:34.660 --> 01:24:36.810
Let me make sure I get
the countries right here.

01:24:36.810 --> 01:24:39.450
Who had the worst profiles
of the 40 countries

01:24:39.450 --> 01:24:42.710
in terms of the biggest gender
differences in these quality

01:24:42.710 --> 01:24:43.920
of life measures?

01:24:43.920 --> 01:24:47.290
Turkey, Tunisia,
and South Korea.

01:24:47.290 --> 01:24:48.890
Where was the United States?

01:24:48.890 --> 01:24:50.420
Sitting somewhere
around the middle

01:24:50.420 --> 01:24:52.440
with most Western
European countries.

01:24:52.440 --> 01:24:55.050
And which were the countries
on earth which, as a block,

01:24:55.050 --> 01:24:58.620
had the lowest degree of
different treatment of people

01:24:58.620 --> 01:25:00.570
in their society
based on gender?

01:25:00.570 --> 01:25:04.830
The ever handy wonderful
Utopian Scandinavians.

01:25:04.830 --> 01:25:06.610
So in comes the Scandinavians.

01:25:06.610 --> 01:25:08.440
And what you show
is, by the time

01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:11.900
you look at the country on
Earth that has the least gender

01:25:11.900 --> 01:25:14.960
differentiation of
any, which is Iceland,

01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:16.910
you notice something different.

01:25:16.910 --> 01:25:19.310
There still is a
gender difference.

01:25:19.310 --> 01:25:24.710
In Iceland, girls are better
at math than boys, slightly.

01:25:24.710 --> 01:25:27.090
A small difference
going on there.

01:25:27.090 --> 01:25:30.320
But nonetheless, as you go
from the countries in which

01:25:30.320 --> 01:25:33.720
from day one, girls
transitioning into women

01:25:33.720 --> 01:25:35.990
are given the most
constraints of freedom

01:25:35.990 --> 01:25:39.170
of life, that's where you're
going to see the biggest math

01:25:39.170 --> 01:25:40.510
difference scores.

01:25:40.510 --> 01:25:44.060
And you look at less and less
of those sort of inequities.

01:25:44.060 --> 01:25:46.980
And the gender difference
in the math score,

01:25:46.980 --> 01:25:49.290
by the time it's at the
Scandinavian countries,

01:25:49.290 --> 01:25:50.460
it's down to zero.

01:25:50.460 --> 01:25:53.260
And then you get to Iceland,
and it actually reverses.

01:25:53.260 --> 01:25:56.800
It's got nothing to do
with your Y chromosome.

01:25:56.800 --> 01:25:58.770
We immediately come
back to the first

01:25:58.770 --> 01:26:02.610
of those questions from before,
that diagnostic question.

01:26:02.610 --> 01:26:03.880
You've got a choice.

01:26:03.880 --> 01:26:07.590
You want to have a sense of,
in this population-- nah,

01:26:07.590 --> 01:26:08.927
even at the individual level.

01:26:08.927 --> 01:26:09.760
You've got a choice.

01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:11.690
You're comparing
two individuals,

01:26:11.690 --> 01:26:14.410
and you want to
guess which one is

01:26:14.410 --> 01:26:16.140
better at math than the other.

01:26:16.140 --> 01:26:19.310
You can either
know their gender,

01:26:19.310 --> 01:26:23.530
or you could know whether they
grew up in Tunisia or Iceland.

01:26:23.530 --> 01:26:25.380
Which fact do you want to know?

01:26:25.380 --> 01:26:27.120
You want to know
about environment.

01:26:27.120 --> 01:26:31.090
Environment is vastly
more powerful there.

01:26:31.090 --> 01:26:33.520
Another feature of that
that has been interesting.

01:26:33.520 --> 01:26:35.700
So you then say
OK, the extremes.

01:26:35.700 --> 01:26:39.300
OK, so in some societies, the
means are exactly the same.

01:26:39.300 --> 01:26:42.180
But what about that difference
way out at the highest

01:26:42.180 --> 01:26:43.390
level of performance.

01:26:43.390 --> 01:26:46.010
As I mentioned the other
day, in the mid-1980s,

01:26:46.010 --> 01:26:48.930
looking at the highest first
percentile of math performance

01:26:48.930 --> 01:26:51.130
on junior high school
kids with their SATs,

01:26:51.130 --> 01:26:55.750
and there was a 13:1 ratio
of males to females in there.

01:26:55.750 --> 01:26:58.540
When it was last
studied a few years ago,

01:26:58.540 --> 01:27:01.550
it's down to a 3:1 ratio.

01:27:01.550 --> 01:27:04.800
Oh, that's obviously due to
evolution over the last 20

01:27:04.800 --> 01:27:07.420
years, because it's
got to be due to genes.

01:27:07.420 --> 01:27:12.530
That's like saying genes explain
the fact that in 1980s people,

01:27:12.530 --> 01:27:15.630
like, wore pads
on their shoulders

01:27:15.630 --> 01:27:19.040
and, like, power sneakers
to work or whatever.

01:27:19.040 --> 01:27:21.120
And the fact that
nobody does that anymore

01:27:21.120 --> 01:27:26.800
shows that the gene for wearing
that on your woman executive

01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:29.980
decor deal has evolved.

01:27:29.980 --> 01:27:31.550
That's asinine.

01:27:31.550 --> 01:27:35.520
You do not go from 13:1
to 3:1 with a trait

01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:38.610
in 20 years in a
highly interbreeding

01:27:38.610 --> 01:27:40.830
mixed population-- in
other words, humans--

01:27:40.830 --> 01:27:42.760
and have this as
a genetic trait.

01:27:42.760 --> 01:27:45.750
Even function at the
extreme has squat

01:27:45.750 --> 01:27:49.130
to do with the
genetics of gender.

01:27:49.130 --> 01:27:52.420
It's, I want to know what
society the person got

01:27:52.420 --> 01:27:53.200
raised in.

01:27:53.200 --> 01:27:55.770
I could care less what
their chromosome is.

01:27:55.770 --> 01:27:57.510
If I want to know
how good they're

01:27:57.510 --> 01:28:00.350
likely to be at math
compared to the other person,

01:28:00.350 --> 01:28:02.250
tell me where they grew up.

01:28:02.250 --> 01:28:05.050
That's the most
important thing to know.

01:28:05.050 --> 01:28:06.700
Interesting additional thing.

01:28:06.700 --> 01:28:10.260
The second most reliable
finding in all of measures

01:28:10.260 --> 01:28:13.330
of cognitive aptitude thing
that has a gender difference

01:28:13.330 --> 01:28:18.340
is, on the average, girls being
better at verbal performance

01:28:18.340 --> 01:28:19.790
tasks than boys.

01:28:19.790 --> 01:28:22.590
Women than men, all
that sort of thing.

01:28:22.590 --> 01:28:25.530
So what's going on in those
40 different countries there?

01:28:25.530 --> 01:28:30.340
What you wind up seeing is,
it depends on which country

01:28:30.340 --> 01:28:30.840
you're in.

01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:33.580
It depends on that
gender equality index.

01:28:33.580 --> 01:28:36.380
And what you see is, in
the worst countries there,

01:28:36.380 --> 01:28:40.180
by these measures, Tunisia-- who
else was it?-- Tunisia, Turkey,

01:28:40.180 --> 01:28:43.530
and South Korea, what
you see is, yeah,

01:28:43.530 --> 01:28:47.500
women get better scores
on verbal tests than men.

01:28:47.500 --> 01:28:50.170
And as you go to the
more equal places,

01:28:50.170 --> 01:28:53.080
the gender difference increases.

01:28:53.080 --> 01:28:55.610
In other words, you've
got one of these.

01:28:55.610 --> 01:28:58.660
The more gender
equal a society is,

01:28:58.660 --> 01:29:01.920
the less of a sex difference
there is in math capabilities

01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:05.770
and the bigger the advantage
is for females over males

01:29:05.770 --> 01:29:07.690
in verbal performance.

01:29:07.690 --> 01:29:10.450
It's got everything to do
with what society you're in.

01:29:10.450 --> 01:29:14.020
This gender difference in
this realm of cognitive skills

01:29:14.020 --> 01:29:16.020
means next to nothing.

01:29:16.020 --> 01:29:18.004
And if I had any
technological skills--

01:29:18.004 --> 01:29:19.420
I kept saying I
was going to bring

01:29:19.420 --> 01:29:21.300
the figure from this
paper, I'll have

01:29:21.300 --> 01:29:23.580
it posted-- because
this one figure,

01:29:23.580 --> 01:29:25.840
it's across all these--
you just look at it

01:29:25.840 --> 01:29:27.620
and there's the answer.

01:29:27.620 --> 01:29:33.230
It's got nothing to do with the
genetics of gender difference.

01:29:33.230 --> 01:29:38.030
OK, so what else would one
want to emphasize here?

01:29:38.030 --> 01:29:40.860
OK, what else would one
want to emphasize here?

01:29:40.860 --> 01:29:44.500
Which is, this is a total
mess and totally complicated.

01:29:44.500 --> 01:29:47.410
OK what have we gotten to so
far in this field of behavior

01:29:47.410 --> 01:29:48.210
genetics?

01:29:48.210 --> 01:29:49.930
There's all these
different ancient ways

01:29:49.930 --> 01:29:51.252
of inferring something.

01:29:51.252 --> 01:29:53.585
Twins, adoption, there's the
much more modern way, which

01:29:53.585 --> 01:29:55.160
is finding the actual genes.

01:29:55.160 --> 01:29:55.910
That's wonderful.

01:29:55.910 --> 01:29:57.000
That's exciting.

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:58.970
Nonetheless, over
and over and over,

01:29:58.970 --> 01:30:00.920
an environment
gets understudied.

01:30:00.920 --> 01:30:03.140
Environment is far more
subtle than you think.

01:30:03.140 --> 01:30:05.640
Environment starts earlier
in life than you think.

01:30:05.640 --> 01:30:08.780
And when you do it in a very
formal quantitative way,

01:30:08.780 --> 01:30:11.780
analyzing what genetic
influences are about,

01:30:11.780 --> 01:30:14.330
you discover that
scientists study things

01:30:14.330 --> 01:30:17.310
under circumstances where
you constantly underestimate

01:30:17.310 --> 01:30:18.810
the importance of environment.

01:30:18.810 --> 01:30:20.730
Blah, blah, etc., etc.

01:30:20.730 --> 01:30:22.990
But at the end of
the day, don't genes

01:30:22.990 --> 01:30:24.900
have something to do
with something or other

01:30:24.900 --> 01:30:26.040
going on with this?

01:30:26.040 --> 01:30:31.240
And obviously, obviously they
have some very important roles.

01:30:31.240 --> 01:30:35.800
You have genes that completely
determine aspects of behavior.

01:30:35.800 --> 01:30:39.630
Single genes that completely
determine your intelligence

01:30:39.630 --> 01:30:42.200
if you are a housefly.

01:30:42.200 --> 01:30:44.160
Lots of interesting
studies there showing

01:30:44.160 --> 01:30:47.230
single gene determination,
a lot of these behaviors.

01:30:47.230 --> 01:30:50.740
And it doesn't matter sort of
what the economic opportunities

01:30:50.740 --> 01:30:53.680
are for houseflies in that
country versus humans.

01:30:53.680 --> 01:30:55.760
What you see there
is yeah, there

01:30:55.760 --> 01:30:59.010
are realms of behavioral
biology where genes

01:30:59.010 --> 01:31:01.000
play very, very strong roles.

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.010
And we will certainly
see some of them

01:31:03.010 --> 01:31:04.690
in the lectures to come.

01:31:04.690 --> 01:31:07.080
But with two qualifiers.

01:31:07.080 --> 01:31:09.600
The first one we
heard the other day.

01:31:09.600 --> 01:31:13.370
Which is, even when, with all
of these criticisms on board

01:31:13.370 --> 01:31:15.550
and you've got
every critical tool

01:31:15.550 --> 01:31:18.350
to slice up anybody
arguing that here's

01:31:18.350 --> 01:31:21.040
a high heritability important
genetic component, blah, blah,

01:31:21.040 --> 01:31:21.750
etc.

01:31:21.750 --> 01:31:23.860
You've completely
cut it to pieces,

01:31:23.860 --> 01:31:25.970
and there still is
a gene that seems

01:31:25.970 --> 01:31:29.750
to be doing something important
for trait X. What we heard

01:31:29.750 --> 01:31:32.860
about the other day is,
nonetheless, think about

01:31:32.860 --> 01:31:36.670
if there is an indirect genetic
route for getting there.

01:31:36.670 --> 01:31:38.910
Is there a gene
for extroversion?

01:31:38.910 --> 01:31:41.480
Or is there a gene
for your height

01:31:41.480 --> 01:31:43.310
and how people of your
height are treated?

01:31:43.310 --> 01:31:45.910
Is there a gene for
picking at grubs?

01:31:45.910 --> 01:31:49.100
Or is there a gene for if you're
really tall, you pick at grubs

01:31:49.100 --> 01:31:50.640
and people don't
make fun of you.

01:31:50.640 --> 01:31:54.300
Is all of that business about
indirect genetic effects?

01:31:54.300 --> 01:31:58.980
So even when you see
a gene for something,

01:31:58.980 --> 01:32:02.510
you have to begin to ask to
make sure that you are not,

01:32:02.510 --> 01:32:05.110
in fact, looking at
an indirect effect.

01:32:05.110 --> 01:32:06.520
Final qualifier.

01:32:06.520 --> 01:32:09.640
When you look at the
really interesting genes

01:32:09.640 --> 01:32:11.176
in terms of what they do.

01:32:11.176 --> 01:32:12.550
When you look at
some of the ones

01:32:12.550 --> 01:32:14.350
that have the most
to do, say, with what

01:32:14.350 --> 01:32:17.270
differentiates our genome
from the chimp genome.

01:32:17.270 --> 01:32:21.400
When you look at things like
juggling your DNA just when

01:32:21.400 --> 01:32:25.000
you're making new neurons,
what you see over and over is,

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:28.580
what human genes are
about most dramatically

01:32:28.580 --> 01:32:31.820
is coding for ways in
which you have freedom

01:32:31.820 --> 01:32:33.860
from the effects of genetics.

01:32:33.860 --> 01:32:37.730
And that is going to be a
theme endlessly in the lectures

01:32:37.730 --> 01:32:38.490
to come.

01:32:38.490 --> 01:32:40.150
OK.

01:32:40.150 --> 01:32:43.410
