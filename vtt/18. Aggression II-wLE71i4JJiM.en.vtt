[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:05.836
Stanford University.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.000
Picking up from Monday,
OK, so we are now well

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.720
into our second topic
of the second half,

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.710
looking at aggression,
competition, cooperation,

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.290
empathy, all those guys.

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.850
And we've got the drill down
by now, starting with behavior

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.060
all the way to the right,
working our way to the left

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.860
all the way back to evolution,
genetics, blah, blah.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.420
Where we left off the
other day was just

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.540
getting into the first
box worth of what's

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:48.510
going on in the brain?

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.840
What is the neurobiology
of what's occurring seconds

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.550
before that aggressive act, that
compassionate act, all of that?

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.720
As we know already, right in
the middle of the limbic system,

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.070
of course, as we know
already, the amygdala

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.760
is playing a really
central role,

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.010
and seeing all the
evidence for it--

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.880
lesion studies, stimulation
studies, the bizarre rarer

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.090
realm of humans who have
had lesions, or stimulation

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.400
there, accidents, or intentional
psycho surgical interventions,

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.470
beginning to look at
the amygdala there,

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.310
and the role that it plays.

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.270
Now, part of what
becomes relevant

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.390
there is seeing the
kind of information

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:27.960
that the amygdala is getting.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.440
And an important
thing to focus on

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:30.940
is something that
was mentioned back

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.110
in the limbic
lecture, the notion we

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:34.900
ended with the other
day, the amygdala.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.940
OK, so you look at somebody
who has had amygdala damage.

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.770
And they tend to not be able
to detect fear-evoking faces.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.800
They are overly trustful.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.020
They are underlie skeptical.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.420
They are not taking in
the sort of information

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.650
we would that leads
us to conclude

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.720
this is a circumstance
that demands arousal,

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.050
vigilance, so on.

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.480
One of the things that was
seen, interesting study

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.300
that I noted at the
end the other day,

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.930
was looking at people with
amygdala lesions, Damasio

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.500
and his group looking at
this, keeping track of where

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.509
the eyes are looking.

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.920
When they see another face, they
are not looking with the eyes

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.590
any or near as much as
everybody else would.

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.670
They are instead tracking around
all sorts of extraneous parts

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:19.530
of the face.

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.120
Normally, people look
at the eyes a whole lot.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.460
And what that winds
up showing is not only

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.740
is the amygdala playing
a role in deciding

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.980
this is a fear or
aggression-evoking stimulus,

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.140
the amygdala is also
on the lookout for it.

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.030
And what we will see in a little
while is one of the things

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.060
testosterone does is
make the amygdala better

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.380
at looking for fear and
anger-evoking faces.

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.380
So part of what the
amygdala is doing

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.970
is taking in
sensory information.

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.511
We touched in the limbic lecture
on one interesting aspect

00:02:53.511 --> 00:02:54.010
of it.

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.430
OK, back to that business,
that the limbic strategy

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.580
of counting the number of
synapses, that strange business

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.670
about olfaction being
only one synapse away

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.470
from lots of parts
of the limbic system,

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.530
including the amygdala
if you were dealing

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.570
with a [INAUDIBLE],
the olfactory world

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.410
as being so emotional
for a rodent.

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.400
For us, we've got something
else interesting happening.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.170
And I think I mentioned this.

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.070
OK, so you've got
the visual system.

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:22.860
And what we have
is the usual rule

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.110
that visual information--
just like auditory,

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.870
just like tactile--
comes in, and goes

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.760
by way of a way station along
the way, whose name we won't

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.540
worry about, and goes
through all these levels

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.520
of cortical processing,
and [? bio cort ?] people

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.460
will remember layer one,
doing dots, to lines,

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.590
to moving lines, all of
that, eventually processing

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.200
assessment, come up with
an idea that, oh, dear,

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.760
this is a menacing face.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.110
And then let the
amygdala know about this.

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.400
What was also found
a number of years ago

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.330
is that there is a shortcut.

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.890
There is a branch coming off
of this way station called

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:58.320
the lateral geniculate.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.370
There's a branch coming
off, which then is only one

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.445
synapse away from the amygdala.

00:04:03.445 --> 00:04:06.970
What we heard is
that's really useful,

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.640
in that it can get you
fear-evoking, arousing

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.640
information that much faster
than going through all

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.040
this cortical processing.

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.399
It is a short cut.

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:18.500
It is not a one synapse away.

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.940
But it certainly makes
for fewer synapses.

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.030
That's a faster
system that we've

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.650
got in order to
very quickly pick up

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.120
information that
should be of interest

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.350
to the amygdala and all
of its fear, anxiety,

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:32.977
aggression-type concerns.

00:04:32.977 --> 00:04:33.810
So that's wonderful.

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.380
That's terrific
for the amygdala.

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:36.860
What I think we
also heard it is it

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.210
comes with a downside, which is
you send all this information

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:42.630
through all these
different steps

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.450
there because it's doing
all this cortical processing

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:46.160
for you.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.170
It's figuring out
all the details

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:50.620
of the sensory information
you're getting in.

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.520
This way, it gets to
the amygdala faster.

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.490
But what gets there
is less accurate.

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.940
You're more likely
to make a mistake.

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.510
And that's the whole world of
people reacting really quickly

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.740
to some peripheral
piece of information,

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.760
which turns out to be different
than they thought it was.

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.050
And before they knew
it, they had reacted.

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.080
This is the cortex sitting
there, still trying to decide,

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.770
is this a
three-dimensional object

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.110
or a two-dimensional one?

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.920
And through this route, you've
already stabbed the individual.

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:23.990
This is a very, very clear
trade-off-- faster information,

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:25.070
less accurate.

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:27.200
And there is, by now,
a lot of evidence

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.920
to suggest that this
particular pathway is

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:33.710
hyper excitable in individuals
with post-traumatic stress

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:37.450
disorder, where that
whole world of all sorts

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:42.070
of acute sensory stimuli
suddenly fling the person back

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:45.200
into where they were when
that happened to them,

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.540
and without the processing
time to figure out,

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:49.510
this isn't exactly the same.

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:52.530
In fact, this is a world away
from where that happened.

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:55.200
Already, the amygdala
is responding.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:57.089
So these short cuts--
but telling you,

00:05:57.089 --> 00:05:59.130
one of the things you give
up with the short cuts

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:02.310
is the analytical accuracy.

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:05.630
OK, so amygdala for that,
amygdala equals fear,

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:07.860
equals anxiety,
equals aggression.

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.170
Isn't that interesting?

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:11.660
In a world in which
amygdala is not afraid,

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:14.090
there's no aggression,
that whole theme there.

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:16.710
The amygdala isn't
always about fear,

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:18.480
and aggression, and anxiety.

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.610
And it's very
informative, the examples

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:22.420
where that's not the case.

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:25.580
One case, really
interesting syndrome

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:27.357
called Williams
syndrome, which we're

00:06:27.357 --> 00:06:29.440
going to hear a lot about
in the language lecture.

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:34.300
Williams syndrome appears to be
a poorly understood imprinted

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:37.620
genetic disorder where you
get, among other things,

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:41.950
kids who are unbelievably
facile with language

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:44.030
and emotional expressivity.

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:46.030
This whole world
of Williams kids,

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:48.060
it's this fascinating
disorder where

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:52.110
you get kids who are basically
borderline retarded in terms

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:53.370
of cognitive function.

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:57.140
Yet, they have this spectacular
adeptness at language,

00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:00.640
at reading emotions in other
people, at communicating them.

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:03.420
They are famously
affectionate kids

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:06.220
amid being very
cognitively impaired.

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:07.680
We'll see in the
language lecture,

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:10.030
most people think
about Williams syndrome

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:13.820
as an interesting example of
the modularity of language

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:15.320
control in the cortex.

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:20.050
You can have very, very
facile language skills

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:22.760
in these individuals who,
nonetheless, are typically

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:25.990
in the IQ range of about
70, argument being,

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:28.720
we'll see in a couple of weeks,
that there are specialized

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.700
cortical areas for language.

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:32.500
For our purposes,
the interesting thing

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:35.210
about Williams kids, and
eventually Williams adults,

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:38.540
is they are extremely trustful.

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:40.850
They are extremely gregarious.

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:44.220
They are incredibly
vulnerable as adults

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:47.200
to being taken advantage
of by other people.

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:50.450
And what you see with Williams
individuals is you basically

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:55.370
cannot evoke amygdala
activation with scary faces.

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:58.100
They don't register in
someone with Williams.

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:01.090
So there, we see that
this is not universally

00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:02.760
serving that role.

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:04.330
Another example
where there seems

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:06.210
to be an exception
until you think about it

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:09.190
a little bit, people
with social phobias.

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:12.700
What studies have shown
is, show a social phobic

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:17.280
any sort of face-- human face--
and their amygdala activates.

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:19.990
Oh, that's not telling
us anything informative.

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:22.330
It's telling us something
very informative,

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:25.200
which is if you have a
severe social phobia,

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:27.820
any face is a scary face to you.

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:30.960
All faces do that, rather
than only ones communicating

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:33.490
certain threatening emotions.

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:35.530
Another one that seems
puzzling, but which

00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:38.080
then makes perfect sense
when you think about it, when

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:41.159
you take people with clinical
depression the amygdala

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:43.450
doesn't necessarily
activate when

00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:46.540
you show them a picture
of something frightening.

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:50.700
It activates when you show them
a picture of something sad.

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:54.990
OK, so now instead of
doing fear and depression,

00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:57.440
the amygdala does
sadness or something.

00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:58.920
If you think about
it for a minute,

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:00.600
that makes perfect sense.

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:03.430
What the amygdala might
very well be doing

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:07.020
is responding to whatever it
is that is most ethologically

00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:11.380
frightening to you-- you as a
species, you as an individual.

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:13.310
If you are somebody
who's depressed,

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:15.020
the most frightening
thing on Earth

00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:18.690
is something sad around you, as
more justification for feeling

00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:21.730
even more depressed, the
amygdala being far more

00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:25.320
subtle than, oh, here's a scary
predator with a knife coming

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:28.850
at me, very much contextual.

00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:32.780
OK, another thing that the
amygdala is brilliant at,

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:35.220
which we will come
back to in more detail,

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:37.710
but on a first pass
it is so depressing,

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:40.930
is the amygdala is probably
the part of your brain

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:44.827
that is best at doing
dichotomizing between us

00:09:44.827 --> 00:09:48.880
and them-- forming categories
in-group, out-group,

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:52.340
and responding to
out-group stimuli.

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:55.840
And we will see two things down
the line, probably on Friday.

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:59.670
Number one, it is
really, really depressing

00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:01.730
how readily the
amygdala forms some

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:04.735
of these us-them dichotomies,
and the sort of them

00:10:04.735 --> 00:10:07.790
that it responds to--
really depressing.

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:09.310
But also some good
news in there,

00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:12.990
remarkably subtle social
manipulations that

00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:15.610
will change the sort
of us-them dichotomies

00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:17.540
that the amygdala responds to.

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:19.440
So stay tuned for that.

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:21.490
OK, so shifting
from the amygdala,

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:24.910
going to the incredibly
interesting and important

00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:26.180
frontal cortex.

00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:28.710
And frontal cortex, obviously,
was doing all sorts of stuff

00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:31.120
two lectures ago
in the sex lecture,

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:33.530
getting you to have
the appropriate context

00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:36.570
for sexual behavior, getting
to do the harder thing,

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:39.200
like leaping over
streams, and head butting

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:41.300
with other antlered
beasts if that's

00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:42.590
part of your mating season.

00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:45.800
Where the frontal cortex
is particularly involved

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:49.770
is this whole world of
regulating appropriate behavior

00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:53.940
in the context of violence,
aggression, competition,

00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:54.950
cooperation.

00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:58.610
Frontal cortex is
incredibly important here.

00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:01.830
OK, back to the limbic
lecture-- the limbic system

00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:06.450
is about sub-cortical structures
underneath, things like that.

00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:08.570
And the cortex is
about the cortex.

00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:10.150
And we heard in
the limbic lecture,

00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:12.740
instead what was originally
that heretical view

00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:15.120
by that neuroanatomist
Nauta saying,

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:18.250
actually, the frontal cortex
is part of the limbic system.

00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:19.520
It should be viewed as such.

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:21.650
And over the years since,
it being viewed as,

00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:24.760
this is the cortical part
of the limbic system.

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:28.710
This is the cortical region
that is intensely involved

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:31.290
with limbic function,
with emotional function.

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:33.980
On an anatomical level,
what we've already seen

00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:38.510
is just as a first pass, tons
of bidirectional connections,

00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:40.500
everything in the
limbic system talking

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:42.800
to the frontal
cortex, frontal cortex

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:45.550
sending projections back
over the limbic system.

00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:47.930
So anatomically, it's there.

00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:51.430
So in terms of what it's doing--
the best way to describe what

00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:53.910
the frontal cortex is
about is when there's

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:57.590
a choice between doing something
harder and something easier,

00:11:57.590 --> 00:11:59.830
and the harder thing is
the better thing to do,

00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:02.640
it's the thing that makes
you do the harder thing.

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:04.950
And we'll see this
plays out in all sorts

00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:07.520
of domains, the
frontal cortex getting

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:09.740
you to do the harder thing.

00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:14.330
First beginning to see the way
it works in terms of wiring--

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:16.970
OK, here we have
reduced the entire world

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:19.690
down to a simplified,
there's two neurons

00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:22.149
that account for all the easier
things you do in your life.

00:12:22.149 --> 00:12:23.731
And there's three
neurons that account

00:12:23.731 --> 00:12:24.840
for all the harder ones.

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:27.400
Here, we have some
circumstance where

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:31.130
there's a circuit at some
juncture, the easier but less

00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:32.720
desirable outcome.

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:35.840
Behavior is this way,
the harder one that way.

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:40.950
And what you see is this has
more inputs then this one.

00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:44.280
This is obviously some
entire circuit of neurons.

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:46.680
And this is highly
simplified, blah, blah.

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:48.630
But what we see is the
way it's set up here

00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:52.410
is that there are more
inputs into this pathway.

00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:54.990
This is what makes
this neuron easier

00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:57.050
to activate than this one.

00:12:57.050 --> 00:13:00.000
There are stronger
inputs into this pathway.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.800
This one has only two
axons going to it.

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:05.060
This one has three--
yes, simplified.

00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:08.430
When you look at the wiring
of the frontal cortex,

00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:11.540
it's sending projections
all over the limbic system,

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:13.380
all over motor areas.

00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:15.460
A characteristic
of the projections

00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:19.880
is that very rarely are
they very strong projections

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:22.100
to any given target area.

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:25.700
They're not the sort of
projections where, here's

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:27.990
this frontal cortical
neuron that is now

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:31.300
dumping all of its axon
terminals into this one neuron

00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:32.110
down there.

00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:35.210
It does not exert a
very strong influence

00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:38.430
over the excitation
of any given neuron.

00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:42.830
Instead, what it has is a
whole lot of weak but diffuse

00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:43.880
projections.

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:46.370
What is the frontal
cortex doing?

00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:49.540
It's slowly massaging
the area there.

00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:54.540
It is giving biasing bits of
de-polarization of excitation.

00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:58.004
So what we've got here
is-- OK, the numbers

00:13:58.004 --> 00:13:58.920
are not quite working.

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:00.940
But in any case,
what we have here is,

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:03.740
here's doing the right
thing that's harder.

00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:05.850
And it's a lot harder
to get this neuron

00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:07.900
to do the right
thing that's harder,

00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:10.360
because there is less of
an input than this pathway.

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:12.400
What the frontal
cortex tends to do

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:16.610
is have these relatively weak
inputs into all these systems

00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:20.160
where it makes it a little
bit harder to just fall

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:21.130
for this one.

00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:23.840
It gives more strength
into this pathway.

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:25.970
The frontal
projections very rarely

00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:27.940
are activating on their own.

00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:32.260
Yes, indeed, we have another
example here of modulating.

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:35.080
If and only if this
pathway is already

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:37.020
struggling to do
the right thing,

00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:40.030
the frontal cortex tends
to be able to push it

00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:42.060
over the top there
to pull it off.

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:46.450
Frontal projections as very
diffuse, relatively weak,

00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:51.250
but biasing towards excitation,
rather than causing it,

00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:54.660
that tends to be the
thing that it does.

00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:58.140
What you see in terms of making
sense of frontal function

00:14:58.140 --> 00:14:59.930
is, as we heard
the other day also,

00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:04.270
a huge whopping projection
from that nucleus accumbens.

00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:06.830
You remember ventral
tegmental, nucleus accumbens,

00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:12.250
this huge dopamine releasing
projection into there.

00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:15.390
And on a certain level--
you want a totally useless

00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:19.070
metaphor, but on a certain level
with the dopamine projection

00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:22.140
is about is-- so here, you've
got the frontal cortex.

00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:23.740
The frontal cortex,
for a living,

00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:25.510
makes you do the
harder thing when

00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:27.020
it's the right thing to do.

00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:30.920
Dopamine is, in a sense,
the fuel for that activity.

00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:35.320
Dopamine, the expectation,
the anticipation, the capacity

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:38.970
of dopamine to generate
goal-directed behaviors

00:15:38.970 --> 00:15:41.460
is heavily running
through this pathway.

00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:43.530
Dopamine is a thing
that's giving,

00:15:43.530 --> 00:15:45.940
in a sense, the frontal
cortex the energy

00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:48.870
to just push you over the
edge, and to tell you,

00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:52.790
yes, go this way instead of
this way, which also intrinsic

00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:58.270
in this lots and lots of frontal
projections that are inhibitory

00:15:58.270 --> 00:15:59.180
in that realm.

00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:02.180
An awful lot of what
frontal cortex is also doing

00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:04.380
is whispering to
this pathway saying,

00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:05.800
you really shouldn't do that.

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:07.120
You're going to regret it.

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:08.600
I know it's tempting right now.

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:12.470
Don't do it, don't do it-- this
super ego sort of neuroanatomy

00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:16.780
there of frontal cortex,
dopamine as very strongly

00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:20.250
stimulatory in there, the
whole role of dopamine

00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:23.140
as driving
goal-directed behavior.

00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:25.540
And that was that critical
business we saw in that study

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:28.680
showing you let the monkey
know that it's now entered one

00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:30.930
of those periods where
if it lever presses,

00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:32.072
it gets the reward.

00:16:32.072 --> 00:16:35.350
Oh, I know just how this works--
anticipation, that's great.

00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:36.600
Up goes dopamine.

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:39.080
If you prevent the
dopamine from going up,

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:41.070
you don't get the
lever pressing.

00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:44.090
Dopamine is not just
about anticipation.

00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:48.370
Dopamine is about driving
the behavior needed

00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:50.650
to get the reward that
you are anticipating,

00:16:50.650 --> 00:16:54.250
dopamine as
goal-directed behavior.

00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:57.200
OK, so what you
begin to see in terms

00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:00.350
of how this frontal
cortex does this making

00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:03.570
you do the harder thing,
it's manifest in all sorts

00:17:03.570 --> 00:17:04.609
of domains.

00:17:04.609 --> 00:17:06.470
Easiest, most
accessible realm is

00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:08.770
seeing what it has
to do with cognition,

00:17:08.770 --> 00:17:10.819
the way in which the
frontal cortex gets

00:17:10.819 --> 00:17:12.339
you to do the harder thing.

00:17:12.339 --> 00:17:16.480
What it helps you to do is
organize bits of information

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:19.690
in ways that makes it
easier to make sense of.

00:17:19.690 --> 00:17:22.700
Here is, if you ever find
yourself being borderline

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:24.680
demented, and somebody
is giving you a test,

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:26.805
this is one of the tests
they're going to give you.

00:17:26.805 --> 00:17:27.760
So start preparing.

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:30.190
This is this
horrifying test called

00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:34.650
the CVLT-- the California
Verbal Learning Task

00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:36.110
or some such thing like that.

00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:37.110
But here's what they do.

00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:39.000
Some neuropsychologist
sits you down.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.294
And says, oh, I'm just
going to tell you something,

00:17:41.294 --> 00:17:42.210
a list of things here.

00:17:42.210 --> 00:17:43.440
See if you can remember.

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:45.140
Today I went to the market.

00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:50.220
And I bought one tomato, one
hammer, one box of cereal,

00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:53.310
one grape, one-- and
goes through a list of 16

00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:55.330
of these, one
every second or so.

00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:56.000
And they finish.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:56.615
And they say.

00:17:56.615 --> 00:17:58.990
OK, do you happen to remember
what I bought at the market

00:17:58.990 --> 00:17:59.640
today?

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:01.860
Oh my God, it is so stressful.

00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:04.760
So you manage to get out like
maybe seven of them correct.

00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:07.127
And the person says,
OK, that's very good.

00:18:07.127 --> 00:18:07.960
Let's do that again.

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:09.170
Today, I went to the market.

00:18:09.170 --> 00:18:13.080
And I brought one tomato, one
hammer, one box of Cheerios,

00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:15.320
one box of-- and goes
through this list again,

00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:17.870
and seeing each time how
many of them you remember,

00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:20.500
beginning to see your
memory acquisition

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:22.885
thing as you're getting closer
and closer to remembering

00:18:22.885 --> 00:18:24.370
all 16.

00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:27.410
It's not until you're maybe
in the third or fourth round

00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:29.470
of doing this that
you begin to notice

00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:34.650
something, which is of the 16
items four of them are fruits.

00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:37.130
Four of them are hardware items.

00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:39.840
Four of them are
bread cereal things.

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:41.206
Four of them are who knows what.

00:18:41.206 --> 00:18:42.580
And they're
scattered throughout.

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:44.500
What the people
typically start doing

00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:47.540
by the third or fourth
one is you begin to group

00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:48.970
them by categories.

00:18:48.970 --> 00:18:54.520
And instead of remembering back
OK, tomato, hammer, cereal,

00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:58.100
fruit, whatever, you first
tell the three out of the four

00:18:58.100 --> 00:18:59.600
fruits that you remember.

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:01.980
Then you tell the two out
of the four hardware items.

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:05.030
You are beginning to
group the information.

00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:08.170
And what that is called
is executive function.

00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:11.000
Executive organizing
strategy, it

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:16.240
is sheer memory systems that are
remembering these 16 factoids.

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:19.080
It is executive organizing
that's telling you,

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:20.790
do you notice some
patterns there?

00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:22.640
Don't just remember
it in sequence.

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:24.900
Don't try to just
remember it in sequence.

00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:26.070
Stop for a second.

00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:27.972
And try to keep track
of the categories,

00:19:27.972 --> 00:19:29.430
because that's
going to be a better

00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:31.060
strategy in the long run.

00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:33.200
That's what the
frontal cortex does.

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:35.720
You get someone with
frontal cortical damage,

00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:38.710
and their capacity to
remember, the learning curve

00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:41.030
is not all that different
from anyone else.

00:19:41.030 --> 00:19:43.380
But they never start
doing the grouping.

00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:46.750
They never start doing what
we might think of as almost

00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:49.290
cognitive strategizing.

00:19:49.290 --> 00:19:50.990
Oh, I see a pattern here.

00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:54.030
And I suspect if I put
the effort into exploiting

00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:56.990
that pattern, it's going to
make it more productive for me

00:19:56.990 --> 00:19:59.460
to try to remember things
rather than just trying

00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:00.680
to do it in sequence.

00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:03.290
So the frontal cortex
is good for that.

00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:05.610
Where else do you get
in the cognitive realm

00:20:05.610 --> 00:20:09.080
the frontal cortex getting
you to do the harder thing?

00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:10.930
Where you get all
this information

00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:13.290
in the cognitive realm
is when you study people

00:20:13.290 --> 00:20:16.510
with frontal damage-- either
people with accidents,

00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:20.310
or very often older individuals
who have strokes there.

00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:22.430
There's a very distinctive
type of dementia

00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:25.140
that takes out the
frontal cortex called

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:26.310
frontotemporal dementia.

00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:28.610
And all sorts of cognitive
tests in those cases

00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:31.140
showing in the
cognitive realm what

00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:34.310
happens when you're not
having this going on

00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:36.120
throughout all the circuitry.

00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:37.580
One thing that
would be given-- OK,

00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:39.390
so you sit down this individual.

00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:43.540
And you say, OK, you
recognize this, don't you?

00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:45.730
Even though most of you
guys don't by now growing up

00:20:45.730 --> 00:20:47.040
in the digital era.

00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:48.792
But this is the face of a clock.

00:20:48.792 --> 00:20:50.750
And it comes with a little
hand and a big hand.

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:52.730
And they point in
informative directions.

00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:55.760
So you ask the person,
OK, you recognize this.

00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:57.260
Of course, this is a clock face.

00:20:57.260 --> 00:20:59.280
Now, where would
you draw the hands

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:03.490
if I said the time was 11:10?

00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:05.770
11:10, so sit for a minute,
and think about where.

00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:08.212
And, of course, it's
10 minutes after 11:00.

00:21:08.212 --> 00:21:09.920
And that's that where
the hands would go.

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:14.170
Someone with frontal damage,
instead, would draw the hands

00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:16.170
at 11 and 10.

00:21:16.170 --> 00:21:17.520
What are the rest of us doing?

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:18.960
We're saying, OK,
the easier thing

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:22.210
is to just get gummed
up on the number 11

00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:24.670
and the number 10-- wait,
wait, don't do that.

00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:28.020
Hold on, remember,
10 is a coding

00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:30.240
for multiples of five
minutes, because that's

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:31.770
the way clocks are organized.

00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:33.600
So 10 is actually two of these.

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:35.100
So it's 11:10.

00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:37.780
10 is a shorthand for
saying 10 minutes after.

00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:39.530
And you put your hands
in the right place.

00:21:39.530 --> 00:21:42.240
Somebody with frontal
damage can't hold off.

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:45.340
And they get pulled by
the easiest interpretation

00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:47.150
of the sound 11:10.

00:21:47.150 --> 00:21:49.790
They draw the
hands at 11 and 10.

00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:51.770
So this is what you would see.

00:21:51.770 --> 00:21:55.000
More examples-- what the
frontal cortex is good at

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.910
is getting you to
inhibit the easier

00:21:57.910 --> 00:22:00.400
route when it is a
very well-learned, very

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:01.750
well-conditioned one.

00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:02.810
Here's what you would do.

00:22:02.810 --> 00:22:04.351
Now you take the
person who you think

00:22:04.351 --> 00:22:05.630
may have some frontal damage.

00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:08.250
And you say, OK, here's
a task I want you to do.

00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:11.140
Starting with December,
tell me the months

00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:13.110
of the year backwards.

00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:16.010
What have we all learned
since way back in first grade

00:22:16.010 --> 00:22:16.900
or whatever?

00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:19.720
That this is an easy
thing going forward.

00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:21.650
This is the harder
thing right now.

00:22:21.650 --> 00:22:23.590
And you will see a person
with frontal damage

00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:31.990
will say OK, December, November,
October, September, October,

00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:33.100
November, December.

00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:35.260
They manage to pull
it off for a while.

00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:38.890
And then they just slip on the
ice back into the easier way.

00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:41.530
It is, you normally
have December followed

00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:43.930
by January, not by November.

00:22:43.930 --> 00:22:46.060
It takes more work
to do it that way.

00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:49.340
People with frontal damage,
they have this intrusion.

00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:53.150
They can't hold off the
over-learned response,

00:22:53.150 --> 00:22:55.720
the more habitual response.

00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:57.950
You would then see with
frontal damage something

00:22:57.950 --> 00:22:59.539
that's termed intrusions.

00:22:59.539 --> 00:23:01.830
Now you would say to the same
person, OK, that's great.

00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:02.371
That's great.

00:23:02.371 --> 00:23:05.090
Now what I want you to do
is start with the number 20

00:23:05.090 --> 00:23:06.560
and count backwards.

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:14.810
And the person will say, OK, 20,
19, 18, 17, September, October,

00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:15.990
November, December.

00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:18.830
And they've slipped back
into the previous task.

00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:21.102
They don't have the
effort here to say,

00:23:21.102 --> 00:23:22.810
we've stopped it with
the months already.

00:23:22.810 --> 00:23:23.950
Now we're doing numbers.

00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:26.420
Don't slip back into
that month stuff.

00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:28.860
But, yet, that's
exactly what occurs.

00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:30.800
You take somebody
with frontal damage.

00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:33.550
You give them would be
called a verbal fluency test.

00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:36.460
You say, OK, one minute,
tell me as many words

00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:39.637
as you could think of starting
with the letter F. Great.

00:23:39.637 --> 00:23:41.220
Now tell me as many
words as you could

00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:43.370
think of starting with the
letter M, with the letter P,

00:23:43.370 --> 00:23:43.960
so on.

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:47.350
And you go with the letter
M. And by the fifth word,

00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:50.810
they're back to words with
F. The previous task intrudes

00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:51.560
in there.

00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:54.452
It has trouble
organizing, strategizing,

00:23:54.452 --> 00:23:55.910
we're done with
the letter F. We're

00:23:55.910 --> 00:23:57.400
done with doing the months.

00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:59.320
Concentrate now,
we're doing the letter

00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:01.390
M. We're doing
numbers backwards.

00:24:01.390 --> 00:24:04.830
Don't fall for the easy
version of just saying 11:10.

00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:07.490
This is the stuff the
frontal cortex does.

00:24:07.490 --> 00:24:10.530
This is what it looks like
when you are getting damage

00:24:10.530 --> 00:24:12.710
to the frontal cortex.

00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:15.190
So cognitive aspects
of that-- what's

00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:19.040
the frontal cortex particularly
good at in the cognitive realm?

00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:23.920
It is making you work, and work,
and work for a cognitive reward

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:25.160
way down the line.

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:27.790
And that's the entire world
of all of you guys already

00:24:27.790 --> 00:24:30.400
gunning for the perfect
GPA that will get you

00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:32.350
into a good nursing
home someday.

00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:36.060
That is your frontal cortex
working to your advantage.

00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:38.930
That's your frontal cortex
doing that, this task

00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:41.400
of gratification postponement.

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:43.010
Do the harder thing.

00:24:43.010 --> 00:24:45.360
Where am I going to
get the energy for it?

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:47.930
It's these frontal
inputs that's just

00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:52.250
biasing so I could do the harder
pathway rather than the easier.

00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:55.230
You find this also when you're
doing electrophysiological,

00:24:55.230 --> 00:24:57.510
when you're recording, you're
sticking in electrodes,

00:24:57.510 --> 00:24:59.560
and seeing when
neurons are excited.

00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:01.710
Suppose, for example,
you've got a monkey.

00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:03.100
And you are recording.

00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:05.500
You have electrodes both
in the visual cortex

00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:07.960
and some other ones
in the frontal cortex.

00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:10.490
And, again, this is one
of those tasks where

00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:14.010
when the bell sounds--
bells don't beep,

00:25:14.010 --> 00:25:16.380
when some buzzer beeps, it
means to the monkey, now,

00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:18.327
OK, every time
the light goes on,

00:25:18.327 --> 00:25:19.910
you have to press a
lever three times.

00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:21.260
And you get a reward.

00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:22.010
That's the rule.

00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:24.810
Buzzer means we're starting
one of those testing sessions

00:25:24.810 --> 00:25:25.430
again.

00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:28.240
Light comes on, hit lever,
light comes on, hit lever.

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:31.364
So you record from
the visual cortex.

00:25:31.364 --> 00:25:32.530
And here's what's happening.

00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:34.430
This is when the
buzzer comes on saying,

00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:37.510
oh, we've just started
one of these test periods.

00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:39.220
And now the light flashes.

00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:42.320
And the visual cortex
activates each time.

00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:44.860
What's going on in
the frontal cortex?

00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:48.840
The second the buzzer goes off,
the frontal cortex activates.

00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:52.410
And it stays up the whole time.

00:25:52.410 --> 00:25:55.090
What is the visual
cortex coding for?

00:25:55.090 --> 00:25:58.060
Individual examples
of this task.

00:25:58.060 --> 00:26:00.210
What's the frontal
cortex coding for?

00:26:00.210 --> 00:26:02.453
It's remembering the rule.

00:26:02.453 --> 00:26:04.770
OK, the buzzer went on.

00:26:04.770 --> 00:26:06.760
That means-- now,
remember, remember,

00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:09.780
remember for the next whatever
period of time, get ready.

00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:12.590
Every time the light
flashes, hit the lever there.

00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:15.140
The task of the
frontal cortex is

00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:18.380
to maintain the rule
throughout, transcending

00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:20.650
the individual examples of it.

00:26:20.650 --> 00:26:22.580
So you can already
see where we're

00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:25.350
heading with moral
development in kids,

00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:27.134
and frontal maturation.

00:26:27.134 --> 00:26:28.800
And all of that's
going to fit in really

00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:31.600
well, the frontal cortex
doing stuff like that.

00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:35.230
What you should begin to notice
is intrinsic in all of this,

00:26:35.230 --> 00:26:37.740
the frontal cortex is
sending these projections

00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:39.110
all over the brain.

00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:42.530
The frontal cortex does not
code for individual examples

00:26:42.530 --> 00:26:46.410
of rules, but instead maintains
rules for long, long periods.

00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:49.860
The frontal cortex
works really hard.

00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:53.190
Frontal cortical neurons have
very high metabolic rates.

00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:56.990
And a whole world of neurology,
thus, is built around the fact

00:26:56.990 --> 00:26:59.830
that frontal cortical
neurons are very fragile.

00:26:59.830 --> 00:27:01.540
They die very readily.

00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:04.040
All sorts of
neurological disorders

00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:07.400
damage the frontal cortex
with behavioral changes

00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:09.730
that go along with that.

00:27:09.730 --> 00:27:12.730
So you've got the wiring,
the patterning, all of that.

00:27:12.730 --> 00:27:15.980
But then at some point
you wonder, well, I

00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:17.310
learn all sorts of rules.

00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:19.430
Back when I was about
three years old,

00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:22.870
I learned this rule having
to do with no more diapers.

00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:24.750
And if you go to the
potty, you get M&amp;Ms.

00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:27.640
And, in fact, I sort of
have internalized this.

00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:30.840
And same does that mean the,
you need to go to the bathroom

00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:34.340
now is internalized that there's
a frontal cortical neuron that

00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:36.100
got excited when I
was three years old

00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:39.460
and got toilet trained, and has
been firing ever since then?

00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:44.120
No, what you see after a while
is the frontal cortical realm

00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:45.274
of remember.

00:27:45.274 --> 00:27:47.690
Remember, you go to the bathroom
when you need to do this.

00:27:47.690 --> 00:27:49.648
Remember, remember, you
say the months forward.

00:27:49.648 --> 00:27:51.280
Remember all these
sorts of things.

00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:54.200
At some point, it
becomes automatic.

00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:56.350
It becomes reflexive.

00:27:56.350 --> 00:27:58.750
And what is seen
is at that point,

00:27:58.750 --> 00:28:03.020
the frontal cortex stops
being the area that is active.

00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:05.030
At some point,
instead, it becomes

00:28:05.030 --> 00:28:08.630
implicit procedural pathways.

00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:11.290
It gets stored
elsewhere in the brain.

00:28:11.290 --> 00:28:14.990
What you see in individuals
with Alzheimer's disease

00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:17.860
where you get a lot of
damage to the hippocampus

00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:20.440
and the cortex-- particularly
the frontal cortex-- what

00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:24.220
you see is all sorts of things
that were learned way back

00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:27.470
when, and learned enough
to just be habitual,

00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:29.200
people can still do.

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:33.210
You will have somebody who
is demented enough that they

00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:36.660
cannot tell you what decade it
is, the name of their spouse,

00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:39.120
the name of their children,
how many children they have,

00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:39.750
whatever.

00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:43.110
But this is someone who
still knows how to knit.

00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:45.780
They learned when they were
seven years old how to knit.

00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:48.490
And now 80 years later,
they can still do that.

00:28:48.490 --> 00:28:51.810
This is not the frontal cortex
remembering the knitting rules

00:28:51.810 --> 00:28:54.260
for the last 70 years or so.

00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:58.190
This is, it became automatic
and got moved elsewhere.

00:28:58.190 --> 00:29:00.590
And a whole bizarre
world you see

00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:02.717
with frontal damage
in individuals

00:29:02.717 --> 00:29:04.800
with these dementias where
some of the things that

00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:09.290
become automatic are remarkable,
suggesting that you've

00:29:09.290 --> 00:29:12.160
got storage capacity in
other places in the brain

00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:14.050
when you don't
have to consciously

00:29:14.050 --> 00:29:17.390
think about it, when something
has become so automatic.

00:29:17.390 --> 00:29:21.110
You go to the bathroom when
you need to void your bladder.

00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:23.250
OK, we don't have to
think about that anymore.

00:29:23.250 --> 00:29:26.320
It has now gotten to
a pathway like this.

00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:29.490
Other brain regions
particularly, the cerebellum,

00:29:29.490 --> 00:29:31.580
seems to play a
larger role in that.

00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:32.570
Stay tuned.

00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:35.800
We are going to be getting
to a very interesting point

00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:37.940
about moral development in kids.

00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:40.950
When do certain moral
rules stop having

00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:43.280
to be coded in the
frontal cortex,

00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:46.340
and instead become as
habitual as toilet training?

00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:48.550
We'll see some really
interesting implications

00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:49.810
of that.

00:29:49.810 --> 00:29:53.500
OK, so what do you see when
you get frontal damage?

00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:56.830
You get all these
cognitive problems there,

00:29:56.830 --> 00:29:59.790
and these problems with doing
the harder but more correct

00:29:59.790 --> 00:30:01.040
thing cognitively.

00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:03.460
You see it as well
in terms of doing

00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:05.900
the harder but more
correct thing in terms

00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:08.180
of behavior, social behavior.

00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:10.790
First classic
example of this, they

00:30:10.790 --> 00:30:12.677
take away your
neurobiology license

00:30:12.677 --> 00:30:14.510
if you don't mention
this guy at some point.

00:30:14.510 --> 00:30:17.640
How many of you have
heard to Phineas Gage?

00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:20.060
How many of you have not
heard of Phineas Gage?

00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:21.645
OK, time for Phineas Gage.

00:30:21.645 --> 00:30:23.520
OK, but the ones who
have heard of him, let's

00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:24.890
all say this in unison.

00:30:24.890 --> 00:30:28.230
OK, Phineas Gage was the
first identified individual

00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:30.150
to have massive frontal damage.

00:30:30.150 --> 00:30:33.870
Phineas Gage was a foreman
on a railroad construction

00:30:33.870 --> 00:30:36.050
line in Vermont in the 1840s.

00:30:36.050 --> 00:30:39.440
One day, thanks to somebody or
other doing something wrong,

00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:41.820
there was an explosion
of some dynamite, which

00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:44.610
blew a large metal rod
through his forehead

00:30:44.610 --> 00:30:48.020
and out the other side,
taking out his frontal cortex

00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:49.420
in the process.

00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:50.940
And this was rather dramatic.

00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:52.450
And this was this
large metal pole

00:30:52.450 --> 00:30:55.400
that went through fast enough
that, in fact, cauterized

00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:56.550
all the blood vessels.

00:30:56.550 --> 00:30:59.710
And you can see that metal pole
at the museum in the Harvard

00:30:59.710 --> 00:31:01.650
Med School Library,
where you can also

00:31:01.650 --> 00:31:04.120
see his skull, which
is very interesting,

00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:06.970
because the rest of Phineas
Gage is about 20 miles from here

00:31:06.970 --> 00:31:07.920
buried in Colma.

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:10.126
So I don't quite know
how his skull wound up

00:31:10.126 --> 00:31:11.250
at that end of the country.

00:31:11.250 --> 00:31:13.630
But in the either case, he
was buried in San Francisco,

00:31:13.630 --> 00:31:17.140
minus-- well, I guess the Dean
of Harvard Med School swooped

00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:17.640
in.

00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:19.700
And before you knew it,
the skull was on its way

00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:20.950
east there with the metal rod.

00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:23.770
But in any case,
OK, so Phineas Gage

00:31:23.770 --> 00:31:27.180
had his frontal cortex
splattered 15 feet behind him.

00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:29.720
And what happened
was, amazingly,

00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:32.000
because it went through
with such force and so fast,

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.240
that it cauterized
all the blood vessels,

00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:37.940
he was actually, like, able
to get up at that point.

00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:40.500
And, most remarkably, with
a bunch of people from work,

00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:42.930
he was able to walk
a mile and a half

00:31:42.930 --> 00:31:46.440
to the nearest doctor, who
being a good diagnostician,

00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:48.730
took a look at Phineas Gage,
and tilted his head back.

00:31:48.730 --> 00:31:50.271
And looked, and he
said, whoa, you've

00:31:50.271 --> 00:31:52.259
got a hole there in
your head, and was

00:31:52.259 --> 00:31:54.050
sort of looking in more
detail, and saying,

00:31:54.050 --> 00:31:56.920
whoa, you've got frontal cortex
got blown out of your head

00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:57.420
there.

00:31:57.420 --> 00:32:01.330
And this was sort of the peak of
diagnostic skills at the time.

00:32:01.330 --> 00:32:04.986
But what happened was the boss
there on the railroad line

00:32:04.986 --> 00:32:07.860
said, Gage, you know what?

00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:09.120
Take the rest of the day off.

00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:10.210
See you tomorrow.

00:32:10.210 --> 00:32:11.330
So Gage goes home.

00:32:11.330 --> 00:32:14.630
And the next day he returns, not
just figuratively but literally

00:32:14.630 --> 00:32:16.370
transformed overnight.

00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:19.210
Gage, who was this
sober, sobrietous,

00:32:19.210 --> 00:32:22.940
religious man, highly reliable
foreman of this entire work

00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:23.930
place, et cetera.

00:32:23.930 --> 00:32:26.380
Gage was never able
to work a day steadily

00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:27.660
for the rest of his life.

00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:32.420
He became this brawling,
abusive, sexually predatory,

00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:33.880
out of control individual.

00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:37.080
And that original doctor,
seeing what he turned into,

00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:38.580
was the first one
who said, well,

00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:41.390
whatever that part of the brain
was that got taken out there,

00:32:41.390 --> 00:32:43.950
whatever it was, that
part of the brain

00:32:43.950 --> 00:32:46.990
reigns in our animal energies.

00:32:46.990 --> 00:32:51.380
And 170 years later, there's
not a hugely better definition

00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:54.540
out there as to what the
frontal cortex is about.

00:32:54.540 --> 00:32:58.760
So Phineas Gage being
the official first one,

00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:00.280
and you learn all
about this guy.

00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:02.800
But very interestingly,
about a year ago somebody

00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:06.000
found the very first
photograph of Phineas Gage.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.510
And go look at that online.

00:33:07.510 --> 00:33:11.250
What's interesting is he looks
like a perfectly normal guy.

00:33:11.250 --> 00:33:14.280
The pole took out his eye
along with the frontal cortex.

00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:16.840
And, obviously, there
was that problem.

00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:19.860
But this is, like, the face
of somebody from the 1850s.

00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:21.360
And there's something,
I don't know,

00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:23.600
I found very moving
about seeing this face

00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:25.520
that everybody learns
about Phineas Gage.

00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:28.540
And everybody has seen his
skull, and the reconstruction

00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:29.420
of the accident.

00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:30.630
And that's right.

00:33:30.630 --> 00:33:32.830
This was, like, a
regular old person

00:33:32.830 --> 00:33:35.270
whose life was
completely destroyed

00:33:35.270 --> 00:33:37.760
when the frontal
cortex scattered

00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:40.850
all behind him there--
remarkable first example

00:33:40.850 --> 00:33:41.470
of that.

00:33:41.470 --> 00:33:44.730
Since then, most of the evidence
for what frontal cortex is

00:33:44.730 --> 00:33:47.610
about from damage
is older individuals

00:33:47.610 --> 00:33:50.562
who have stroke damage
to the frontal cortex.

00:33:50.562 --> 00:33:52.770
And what I mentioned, I
think, in the limbic lecture,

00:33:52.770 --> 00:33:55.030
one example of what
this looks like was

00:33:55.030 --> 00:33:58.570
a horrifying case in a
facility in the East Bay

00:33:58.570 --> 00:34:01.130
some years ago where
an 80-year-old man who

00:34:01.130 --> 00:34:03.760
had had extensive frontal
damage due to a stroke

00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:06.320
was found to have raped
an 80-year-old woman

00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:07.880
with Alzheimer's disease.

00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:11.699
This is what frontal damage
looks like in an 80-year-old.

00:34:11.699 --> 00:34:14.590
Here's something very
interesting to consider,

00:34:14.590 --> 00:34:16.600
and seeing exactly
the terrain we're

00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:19.530
heading into here with
this sort of information,

00:34:19.530 --> 00:34:25.290
approximately 25% of men on
death row in this country

00:34:25.290 --> 00:34:27.570
have a history of
concussive head trauma

00:34:27.570 --> 00:34:29.600
to the front of their head.

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:32.110
Front of the head,
where you wind up

00:34:32.110 --> 00:34:35.790
damaging the front of the
brain, frontal cortical damage.

00:34:35.790 --> 00:34:39.130
And what we enter into
here is this whole realm

00:34:39.130 --> 00:34:43.400
where this stuff is stupefyingly
relevant to making sense

00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:47.130
of criminal behavior in
humans-- possibilities

00:34:47.130 --> 00:34:48.760
of frontal damage.

00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:51.540
Currently, there
is one law that's

00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:54.190
on the books in the majority
of states in this country

00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:58.470
for deciding when somebody is so
organically impaired that they

00:34:58.470 --> 00:35:00.670
count as having an
insanity defense,

00:35:00.670 --> 00:35:05.300
rather than being criminally
culpable for their acts.

00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:07.800
And this is something
called the McNaughton rule.

00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:09.930
McNaughton rule,
everybody gets taught.

00:35:09.930 --> 00:35:12.750
What the McNaughton rule
is, can the individual

00:35:12.750 --> 00:35:16.020
tell the difference
between right and wrong?

00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:18.640
This is the gold
standard in courts

00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:22.490
as to whether or not somebody
gets a organically impaired

00:35:22.490 --> 00:35:24.560
insanity defense ruling or not.

00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:28.850
McNaughton, whose work was
all of this cutting edge

00:35:28.850 --> 00:35:32.480
neurobiology was based on,
McNaughton was most probably

00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:35.530
a paranoid schizophrenic,
a guy in 1840

00:35:35.530 --> 00:35:38.370
who attempted to assassinate
the Prime Minister of England,

00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:42.170
and was so clearly,
clearly psychotic

00:35:42.170 --> 00:35:43.910
that this was the
first case of the jury

00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:46.640
formally saying that,
no, there is something

00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:50.130
too sick about this man to hold
him responsible for his acts.

00:35:50.130 --> 00:35:52.520
And the clearest thing that
came through in that trial

00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:55.700
was, he could not
distinguish right from wrong.

00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:57.600
And the sort of
thing that absolutely

00:35:57.600 --> 00:36:00.930
does in somebody attempting
to a McNaughton defense

00:36:00.930 --> 00:36:03.030
in a criminal trial
is if there's evidence

00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:06.170
that they tried to cover
their tracks afterward,

00:36:06.170 --> 00:36:09.160
that they were aware that
they had done something

00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:10.570
which was unacceptable.

00:36:10.570 --> 00:36:12.357
What you see with
people who can't

00:36:12.357 --> 00:36:14.190
tell the difference
between right and wrong,

00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:15.700
there is no evidence
of them trying

00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:16.920
to cover up their tracks.

00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:20.020
Where do you see the McNaughton
rule standardly applied?

00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:22.590
Severe, severe schizophrenics.

00:36:22.590 --> 00:36:24.990
And, for example, John
Hinckley, the person

00:36:24.990 --> 00:36:34.580
who tried to assassinate
Reagan in the 1980s,

00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:37.620
and he was found
innocent-- or guilty

00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:40.000
with an insanity
defense, because he

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:43.250
failed a McNaughton ruling,
severe schizophrenic.

00:36:43.250 --> 00:36:46.350
So this has been the gold
standard in most of the courts,

00:36:46.350 --> 00:36:48.120
in most of the states,
in this country.

00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:51.580
The only way you could
be held not accountable

00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:54.530
for your criminal actions
because of organic impairment

00:36:54.530 --> 00:36:56.450
would be if you can't
tell the difference

00:36:56.450 --> 00:36:59.350
between right and wrong.

00:36:59.350 --> 00:37:01.830
But then you've got a problem,
because you get people

00:37:01.830 --> 00:37:03.570
with frontal cortical damage.

00:37:03.570 --> 00:37:06.700
And they can tell the difference
between right and wrong.

00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:07.900
They know the rules.

00:37:07.900 --> 00:37:09.630
They can state them for you.

00:37:09.630 --> 00:37:12.460
Yet, they can't control
their behaviors.

00:37:12.460 --> 00:37:14.680
And this comes through
with all sorts of tests.

00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:18.120
But you could show this now
with people with frontal damage.

00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:21.310
And, for example, here's the
M&amp;M test that you give them.

00:37:21.310 --> 00:37:23.720
And what you've got is
something desirable.

00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:26.280
In this hand, you have
five M&amp;Ms. In this hand,

00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:27.320
you have one.

00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:30.770
And the rule is, if the person
reaches for the five M&amp;Ms,

00:37:30.770 --> 00:37:32.380
you pull your hand away quickly.

00:37:32.380 --> 00:37:34.690
And they get one
M&amp;M as a reward.

00:37:34.690 --> 00:37:37.670
If they reach for the one
M&amp;M, you pull your hand away.

00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:39.470
And you give them five M&amp;Ms.

00:37:39.470 --> 00:37:42.440
In other words, can they
be disciplined enough

00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:45.100
to not reach for the
five M&amp;M, and instead

00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:46.750
hold out and go for one?

00:37:46.750 --> 00:37:48.800
You get more of a
reward that way.

00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:51.930
By doing the harder thing,
you will get more of a reward.

00:37:51.930 --> 00:37:54.600
Extensive frontal
damage, they never,

00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:57.360
ever, ever are able to
reach for the one M&amp;M.

00:37:57.360 --> 00:38:01.160
They always get pulled
towards the easier solution--

00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:03.490
the easier, more
superficial way.

00:38:03.490 --> 00:38:05.790
There's five M&amp;Ms.
That's what I want.

00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:08.550
Instead of being able to
do the executive stepping

00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:12.630
back, and saying, if I go for a
one right now, I will get five.

00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:16.140
What is remarkable is you get an
individual with frontal damage.

00:38:16.140 --> 00:38:18.870
And they will tell
you what the rule is.

00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:21.270
They will sit there
and say, I know.

00:38:21.270 --> 00:38:22.510
I know what you're up to.

00:38:22.510 --> 00:38:24.000
You want me to grab the five.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.125
But then I'll only get one.

00:38:25.125 --> 00:38:28.420
What I need to do is grab the--
and then they go for the five.

00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:31.040
They can verbalize
the rule right there.

00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:34.170
They know the difference
between right and wrong.

00:38:34.170 --> 00:38:37.480
This is not organic impairment
of knowing the rules.

00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:40.800
This is organic impairment of
being able to follow the rules.

00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:44.500
And it is extraordinary
what this one feature

00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:48.040
of what the frontal cortex does,
the difference between knowing

00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:50.480
that there is a difference,
and being able to

00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:52.790
activate this pathway
instead of that.

00:38:52.790 --> 00:38:56.930
This is hugely, hugely
challenging in the courts.

00:38:56.930 --> 00:38:59.800
At the time that Hinckley
attempted to kill Reagan,

00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:01.580
every single state
in the country

00:39:01.580 --> 00:39:03.850
that had a McNaughton
ruling in place-- yeah?

00:39:03.850 --> 00:39:06.048
So for those people that
just have the damage

00:39:06.048 --> 00:39:07.833
and know the rules,
would they cover up

00:39:07.833 --> 00:39:10.411
the tracks in court case so
they would be deemed not worthy

00:39:10.411 --> 00:39:12.480
of the McNaughton rule?

00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:18.240
OK, yeah, would fail the
McNaughton ruling, absolutely,

00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:20.841
because they know the difference
between right and wrong.

00:39:20.841 --> 00:39:22.299
So they would carry
out the action,

00:39:22.299 --> 00:39:24.900
then realize it was
wrong, so try and hide it?

00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:26.010
Yeah, exactly.

00:39:26.010 --> 00:39:28.870
Or if they're disturbed
enough-- OK, for our purposes,

00:39:28.870 --> 00:39:30.870
yes, the person will
know the difference

00:39:30.870 --> 00:39:32.000
between right and wrong.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.040
But they still cannot
regulate their behavior.

00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:37.050
And this is a huge problem.

00:39:37.050 --> 00:39:39.490
What you wind up seeing
is the McNaughton rule

00:39:39.490 --> 00:39:42.440
has generally been accepted in
most states in this country.

00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:46.840
At the time that the Reagan
assassination attempt was made,

00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:50.240
federal criminal rulings
had McNaughton ruling in it.

00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:51.960
Almost all the states
had McNaughton.

00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:55.010
And something, about
10 or 11 of them,

00:39:55.010 --> 00:39:59.890
also had organic impairment of
volitional control recognizing

00:39:59.890 --> 00:40:01.440
realms of frontal damage.

00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:03.020
And what was very
interesting was

00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:05.990
in the aftermath of Hinckley
being found criminally

00:40:05.990 --> 00:40:08.660
insane instead of
guilty, there were

00:40:08.660 --> 00:40:12.920
these neanderthal bellowings
all over the country, editorials

00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:16.060
everywhere, about how Hinckley
had gotten away with it.

00:40:16.060 --> 00:40:19.520
Within a month, the
federal government Congress

00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:22.170
revoked the ability to
have a McNaughton ruling

00:40:22.170 --> 00:40:25.160
in any federal criminal trial.

00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:27.160
The vast majority of
states in this country,

00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:30.080
their legislatures
promptly leapt into action

00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:31.520
to repeal McNaughton.

00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:35.040
And along the way, I think
in all but one or two states,

00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:37.190
the volitional
impairment rulings

00:40:37.190 --> 00:40:38.860
went down the tubes also.

00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:40.960
And at this point,
the vast majority

00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:44.300
of states in this country, you
could have your frontal cortex

00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:46.820
blown out of the water and
you've got one half neuron

00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:48.040
still functioning there.

00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:50.920
And that is not relevant
in a court of law--

00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:54.370
an area that desperately,
desperately needs some reform.

00:40:54.370 --> 00:40:57.510
To give you a sense of how
bizarre this could look,

00:40:57.510 --> 00:40:59.530
this dissociation
here between knowing

00:40:59.530 --> 00:41:01.390
the difference between
right and wrong

00:41:01.390 --> 00:41:04.130
and being able to
regulate your behavior,

00:41:04.130 --> 00:41:07.520
this is what it would look like
in terms of criminal behavior

00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:09.300
with frontal cortical damage.

00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:10.970
And, bizarrely,
this was actually

00:41:10.970 --> 00:41:13.560
a law case I was involved
with some years ago,

00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:15.680
where this was an
individual who had just

00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:18.620
been convicted of his
eighth and ninth murders.

00:41:18.620 --> 00:41:20.770
And this was a serial murderer.

00:41:20.770 --> 00:41:24.690
And he was like a nightmare
beyond imagination,

00:41:24.690 --> 00:41:26.460
what this man was.

00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:28.790
And this eighth and
ninth one had just

00:41:28.790 --> 00:41:33.760
been two boys he had abducted,
kept captive for a week,

00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:38.860
sexually raped, sexually
mutilated, then strangled.

00:41:38.860 --> 00:41:40.770
And this was number
eight and nine.

00:41:40.770 --> 00:41:43.260
And he had been brought
out of a maximum security

00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:46.730
prison in Florida, were
we serving a whole bunch

00:41:46.730 --> 00:41:48.170
of other life sentences.

00:41:48.170 --> 00:41:49.839
And this was a case
down in San Diego

00:41:49.839 --> 00:41:51.380
that he was brought
out for that one.

00:41:51.380 --> 00:41:54.610
And the defense consisted of
three minutes of the defense

00:41:54.610 --> 00:41:57.020
attorneys getting up and
saying, yes, he did it.

00:41:57.020 --> 00:41:58.210
He absolutely did it.

00:41:58.210 --> 00:41:59.480
This was the defense.

00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:02.300
So this was now in the
penalty phase deciding,

00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:04.360
was this person going to
get the death penalty?

00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:06.730
Or was he going to
get life in prison

00:42:06.730 --> 00:42:08.340
without the chance for parole?

00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:10.170
And the relevant
thing about him was

00:42:10.170 --> 00:42:13.610
when he was six years old he had
had a massive car accident that

00:42:13.610 --> 00:42:15.340
destroyed his frontal cortex.

00:42:15.340 --> 00:42:18.230
He spent two months in
a coma, no prior history

00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:22.080
of anti-social behavior, no
family history of any of it.

00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:25.960
Came out of it extremely
behaviorally disinhibited.

00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:29.420
By age 11, he had assaulted his
first individual, first murder

00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:32.970
by age 13-- a completely
broken machine.

00:42:32.970 --> 00:42:35.340
Here's what behavior
looks like in somebody

00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:37.750
with no frontal
cortex in this realm.

00:42:37.750 --> 00:42:39.580
One of the things he
also did, in addition

00:42:39.580 --> 00:42:42.420
to his string of murders,
were kidnapping, and rape,

00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:44.500
and aggravated
assault. And this was

00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:48.010
one woman who had managed to,
fortunately, survive this.

00:42:48.010 --> 00:42:50.810
And she'd been abducted
by him, where he took her

00:42:50.810 --> 00:42:53.650
to his apartment and kept
her there for a week,

00:42:53.650 --> 00:42:56.560
repeatedly raping her,
beating her senseless, days

00:42:56.560 --> 00:42:58.150
and days of this going on.

00:42:58.150 --> 00:43:01.750
And, eventually, whatever it
is that shifted in him shifted.

00:43:01.750 --> 00:43:05.410
He had, of course, her wallet in
the process of kidnapping her,

00:43:05.410 --> 00:43:07.280
and seeing her name,
where she lived,

00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:11.190
he finally says, OK, time to
go, bundles her into his car,

00:43:11.190 --> 00:43:12.750
and drive her home.

00:43:12.750 --> 00:43:16.420
And as he lets her out, he
says, I had a really good time.

00:43:16.420 --> 00:43:17.560
I hope you did too.

00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:18.740
Here's my phone number.

00:43:18.740 --> 00:43:22.650
Maybe we can get together again
sometime, and drives away.

00:43:22.650 --> 00:43:25.960
And no surprise, he was
arrested within an hour or so,

00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:28.940
and eventually sort of
pinned to a whole bunch

00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:29.830
of these other ones.

00:43:29.830 --> 00:43:33.380
This is what it looks like when
you've got no frontal cortex.

00:43:33.380 --> 00:43:37.050
What's interesting there is
he's obviously made no attempt

00:43:37.050 --> 00:43:38.290
to cover his tracks.

00:43:38.290 --> 00:43:41.370
He was able to verbalize
some of these rules,

00:43:41.370 --> 00:43:43.100
and say it was inappropriate.

00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:46.940
And he was able even to be told
the specifics of his own case

00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:49.080
with other names used,
and be able to say,

00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:51.420
whoa, that's not
something you should do.

00:43:51.420 --> 00:43:52.680
That against the law.

00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:56.210
At these junctures, though,
completely going off the rails.

00:43:56.210 --> 00:43:59.070
He had an interesting
combination, though,

00:43:59.070 --> 00:44:00.700
which is that there
were some elements

00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:05.000
of the difference between
right and wrong aspect of it.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:08.730
The fact that he had his frontal
cortex damage so early in life,

00:44:08.730 --> 00:44:13.130
what you tend to see is
around age 5 or 6 or younger,

00:44:13.130 --> 00:44:16.790
the person tends to never quite
incorporate the rules either.

00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:18.700
It's not till you
get-- say, adults

00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:20.160
who get frontal
damage that you get

00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:25.740
the absolutely pure dissociation
between this is not OK to do.

00:44:25.740 --> 00:44:27.520
This is a wrong thing to do.

00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:28.860
I am not going to do it.

00:44:28.860 --> 00:44:30.260
And then goes and does it.

00:44:30.260 --> 00:44:33.060
He, instead, had this much
more mixed case there.

00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:35.370
When you get the frontal
damage around ages five,

00:44:35.370 --> 00:44:37.620
or six, or younger,
you get what is now

00:44:37.620 --> 00:44:40.000
termed acquired sociopothy.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:42.800
You don't do a great
job of incorporating

00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:44.100
the rules themselves.

00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:45.850
And you certainly
can't act on it.

00:44:45.850 --> 00:44:47.990
So this is what it
looks like with someone

00:44:47.990 --> 00:44:51.980
who is that broken in
this part of the brain.

00:44:51.980 --> 00:44:55.475
Ironic ending, first
jury was hungry.

00:44:55.475 --> 00:44:58.740
We got one person to hold
out for organic impairment

00:44:58.740 --> 00:45:01.070
and give him life
without parole.

00:45:01.070 --> 00:45:02.190
So that was a mistrial.

00:45:02.190 --> 00:45:04.689
And second jury went through
the whole thing all over again.

00:45:04.689 --> 00:45:07.390
And it took them three hours
to give him the death penalty.

00:45:07.390 --> 00:45:11.140
So what's very
interesting there is,

00:45:11.140 --> 00:45:14.410
like, 25% of men
on death row have

00:45:14.410 --> 00:45:18.430
a history of concussive trauma
to their frontal cortex--

00:45:18.430 --> 00:45:20.710
really, really interesting.

00:45:20.710 --> 00:45:25.020
But now we begin to see some
of those if-then clauses.

00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:27.870
Here's another individual with
a history of frontal damage.

00:45:27.870 --> 00:45:30.530
And this is a relative of
a close friend of mine.

00:45:30.530 --> 00:45:32.810
And this was someone who
when he was being born

00:45:32.810 --> 00:45:34.580
there was a birth complication.

00:45:34.580 --> 00:45:37.080
And they had to use calipers,
and something slipped,

00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:38.580
and caused frontal damage.

00:45:38.580 --> 00:45:41.380
And frontally disinhibited.

00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:45.200
This is an individual who is now
an adult who is unconstrained

00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:47.130
by the laws of society.

00:45:47.130 --> 00:45:50.730
This is an individual who
cannot regulate his behavior.

00:45:50.730 --> 00:45:51.830
What does he do?

00:45:51.830 --> 00:45:53.780
Whenever there's
family get-togethers,

00:45:53.780 --> 00:45:57.190
he plays the piano way
longer than anybody else

00:45:57.190 --> 00:45:58.250
wants to listen to.

00:45:58.250 --> 00:46:01.040
He can't pick up the cues
that everybody has had enough

00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:02.510
and wants to go eat dinner.

00:46:02.510 --> 00:46:04.130
Well, that was great.

00:46:04.130 --> 00:46:06.400
I think the pot roast is
getting a little cold by now.

00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:07.524
Wasn't that great everyone?

00:46:07.524 --> 00:46:10.210
Wasn't that-- and
just keeps, oh my God.

00:46:10.210 --> 00:46:11.800
He's out of control.

00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:14.420
No less frontal damage
than this guy did.

00:46:14.420 --> 00:46:16.120
So here we have this puzzle.

00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:19.110
We do not have the simple
machine output there,

00:46:19.110 --> 00:46:21.960
of, oh, massive frontal
damage, this person

00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:23.280
is a serial murderer.

00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:24.990
Massive frontal
damage, this person

00:46:24.990 --> 00:46:27.590
plays Scott Joplin
for hours and hours

00:46:27.590 --> 00:46:30.630
until even his grandmother
can't stay in the room anymore.

00:46:30.630 --> 00:46:31.890
What's the difference?

00:46:31.890 --> 00:46:34.900
I think we begin to see
some of our if-then clauses

00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:36.200
perhaps relevant.

00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:39.520
The Scott Joplin playing one,
upper middle class family,

00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:41.460
tremendous family support.

00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:43.470
This guy coming from
a family anything

00:46:43.470 --> 00:46:48.010
but that, we begin to see the,
if you have no frontal cortex

00:46:48.010 --> 00:46:51.530
but you have tremendous
amounts of family support, lots

00:46:51.530 --> 00:46:54.370
of opportunities, blah, blah,
it is going to look different

00:46:54.370 --> 00:46:56.510
than the massive case of it.

00:46:56.510 --> 00:46:59.640
OK, so now looking
at that, what we see

00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:01.640
is there's just a
couple of states

00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:03.637
and the couple of juries
in this country that

00:47:03.637 --> 00:47:05.470
could deal with the
implications of somebody

00:47:05.470 --> 00:47:08.600
having 99% of their
frontal cortex destroyed.

00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:11.690
All you need to do to see the
problem we're up against is,

00:47:11.690 --> 00:47:13.180
what happens if
you've got somebody

00:47:13.180 --> 00:47:18.170
who's got 97% of their frontal
cortex, destroyed or 94%,

00:47:18.170 --> 00:47:18.980
or 85?

00:47:18.980 --> 00:47:22.690
Or finally in our realm, where
we all just have different

00:47:22.690 --> 00:47:23.660
sized ones.

00:47:23.660 --> 00:47:26.920
And the person next to you
has 5% more synapses there,

00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:30.560
or 3% fewer re-uptake
pumps, or whatever.

00:47:30.560 --> 00:47:34.200
That is beginning to get into a
realm that is very challenging.

00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:37.790
OK, so legal implications
there-- enormous ones,

00:47:37.790 --> 00:47:41.390
and ones where reform
is desperately needed.

00:47:41.390 --> 00:47:42.400
This reminds me.

00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:44.320
Here is an example
which strikes me

00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:46.590
as historically quite amazing.

00:47:46.590 --> 00:47:48.610
So we have this
system saying, yes, it

00:47:48.610 --> 00:47:52.320
is possible to be responsible
for your criminal behavior.

00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:53.930
But here's this one exception.

00:47:53.930 --> 00:47:56.960
If you happen to have all
of these neurons destroyed

00:47:56.960 --> 00:47:59.740
and you're in Oregon, you can
have this criminal defense.

00:47:59.740 --> 00:48:00.716
And it's effective.

00:48:00.716 --> 00:48:02.040
Oh yeah, there's this footnote.

00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:04.810
Every now and then,
something can happen so

00:48:04.810 --> 00:48:06.440
that you get into a
different category

00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:10.610
than people who have done
something awful because soul,

00:48:10.610 --> 00:48:13.810
or evil, or whatever
terms are coming in there.

00:48:13.810 --> 00:48:16.030
Really interesting
piece of history--

00:48:16.030 --> 00:48:18.870
16th century, during
the period where

00:48:18.870 --> 00:48:21.620
if you had an epileptic seizure,
you were virtually guaranteed

00:48:21.620 --> 00:48:23.460
to be burned at the
stake as a witch,

00:48:23.460 --> 00:48:25.440
because there was a
medical explanation

00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:29.180
for epilepsy at the time,
which was demonic possession.

00:48:29.180 --> 00:48:31.910
And you were obviously a
witch of some sort or other.

00:48:31.910 --> 00:48:35.450
And, OK, so that was the
medical knowledge of the time.

00:48:35.450 --> 00:48:37.800
And if someone was
accused of a witch in most

00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:41.060
Western European countries where
the Inquisition was occurring,

00:48:41.060 --> 00:48:42.610
the rule of the law
at the time was,

00:48:42.610 --> 00:48:45.170
how do you confirm if
somebody is a witch or not?

00:48:45.170 --> 00:48:47.930
You read them the story
of the crucifixion.

00:48:47.930 --> 00:48:51.030
And if they don't cry,
they are obviously a witch.

00:48:51.030 --> 00:48:52.430
And that was the test.

00:48:52.430 --> 00:48:53.450
That was the legal test.

00:48:53.450 --> 00:48:55.320
If somebody was
not moved to tears

00:48:55.320 --> 00:48:57.170
by the story of Christ
being crucified,

00:48:57.170 --> 00:48:59.410
they were obviously a witch,
and would very quickly

00:48:59.410 --> 00:49:01.590
be burned at the stake.

00:49:01.590 --> 00:49:05.720
At that point, one very,
very progressive physician

00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:09.150
who was up on the top of
behavioral biology insights

00:49:09.150 --> 00:49:13.320
at the time wrote a pamphlet
saying, well, yes, of course,

00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:15.790
we need to get rid of witches
because they're bad news.

00:49:15.790 --> 00:49:16.920
And of course we
should burn them.

00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:18.044
And this is very good test.

00:49:18.044 --> 00:49:20.460
You have to remember,
though, that every now

00:49:20.460 --> 00:49:24.130
and then in some elderly
women the lacrimal glands can

00:49:24.130 --> 00:49:25.190
atrophy.

00:49:25.190 --> 00:49:27.110
So they can't cry.

00:49:27.110 --> 00:49:31.270
So this would be someone who
is involuntarily unable to cry,

00:49:31.270 --> 00:49:32.794
rather than they're a witch.

00:49:32.794 --> 00:49:34.210
You just need to
keep that in mind

00:49:34.210 --> 00:49:36.210
when you do some of that
witch sentencing stuff.

00:49:36.210 --> 00:49:39.040
Sometimes it could be due
to this organic impairment

00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:39.580
business.

00:49:39.580 --> 00:49:43.140
But the overall structure, yeah,
let's get rid of those witches.

00:49:43.140 --> 00:49:45.030
And that's a very good
way of getting at it.

00:49:45.030 --> 00:49:46.930
That makes no sense at all.

00:49:46.930 --> 00:49:50.460
I suspect ultimately saying that
in a small handful of places,

00:49:50.460 --> 00:49:52.830
if you have no
frontal cortex at all,

00:49:52.830 --> 00:49:54.310
we're talking about neurology.

00:49:54.310 --> 00:49:55.840
If you've got any
frontal cortex,

00:49:55.840 --> 00:49:59.470
we're talking about morality,
and soul, and even all of that.

00:49:59.470 --> 00:50:02.460
I suspect it will eventually
make as little sense

00:50:02.460 --> 00:50:06.150
as lacrimal glands drying up.

00:50:06.150 --> 00:50:08.114
OK, I'm obviously just
on the edge of tirading.

00:50:08.114 --> 00:50:09.530
So let's take a
five minute break.

00:50:09.530 --> 00:50:12.524
And we will continue.

00:50:12.524 --> 00:50:14.690
Frontal cortex [? of ?]
[? viewers, ?] keeping track

00:50:14.690 --> 00:50:18.060
of all those different rules,
and keeping you from belching

00:50:18.060 --> 00:50:19.530
loudly in the
middle of a lecture,

00:50:19.530 --> 00:50:22.040
and all those other frontal
cortical sort of tasks.

00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:27.526
What's the time of day when your
frontal cortex is least active?

00:50:27.526 --> 00:50:28.025
Any guesses?

00:50:31.260 --> 00:50:33.713
OK, wait somebody
say something clear.

00:50:33.713 --> 00:50:34.460
Late at night.

00:50:34.460 --> 00:50:36.325
Late at night,
when late at night?

00:50:36.325 --> 00:50:37.200
When you're sleeping.

00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:40.730
When you're sleeping,
when when you're sleeping?

00:50:40.730 --> 00:50:43.780
REM sleep-- REM sleep,
your frontal cortex

00:50:43.780 --> 00:50:45.830
basically shuts down entirely.

00:50:45.830 --> 00:50:48.529
That's why your
dreams make no sense.

00:50:48.529 --> 00:50:50.070
That's where your
dreams you're doing

00:50:50.070 --> 00:50:53.430
all sorts of things you would
never want to do in real life.

00:50:53.430 --> 00:50:55.230
The thing about
the frontal cortex

00:50:55.230 --> 00:50:58.940
is that it keeps you from doing
and saying the sort of stuff

00:50:58.940 --> 00:51:01.530
that all of us contemplate
at various times,

00:51:01.530 --> 00:51:05.070
but we would die if anybody
knew we were thinking that.

00:51:05.070 --> 00:51:08.770
You wipe out the frontal
cortex, and you do it.

00:51:08.770 --> 00:51:10.887
Or you take the
frontal cortex offline

00:51:10.887 --> 00:51:11.970
in the middle of dreaming.

00:51:11.970 --> 00:51:15.260
And, suddenly, that seems like
a wonderfully prudent thing

00:51:15.260 --> 00:51:17.840
to be doing with yourself
in the middle of a dream.

00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:21.030
That's when the frontal
cortex is least active.

00:51:21.030 --> 00:51:23.770
OK, so now frontal
cortex, looking

00:51:23.770 --> 00:51:26.060
at one of its most
distinctive, interesting things

00:51:26.060 --> 00:51:28.490
about its function,
its development.

00:51:28.490 --> 00:51:31.065
When does it
develop after birth?

00:51:31.065 --> 00:51:32.690
And I think what I've
already mentioned

00:51:32.690 --> 00:51:35.230
is the frontal
cortex is interesting

00:51:35.230 --> 00:51:39.700
because it's the last part of
your brain to fully develop.

00:51:39.700 --> 00:51:42.880
It is the last part of
your brain to fully form

00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:45.650
all of the myelin on its axons.

00:51:45.650 --> 00:51:48.560
It's the last part to get
its full large complement

00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:51.750
of synapses, and branching
connections, and such.

00:51:51.750 --> 00:51:54.250
It's the last part of
the brain to develop.

00:51:54.250 --> 00:51:58.360
When does the frontal cortex, on
the average, completely mature,

00:51:58.360 --> 00:52:00.310
go online for the first time?

00:52:00.310 --> 00:52:05.100
Around age 25, which
is astonishing,

00:52:05.100 --> 00:52:08.020
which among other things
should be reckoned

00:52:08.020 --> 00:52:10.490
in the context that,
probably, all sorts of you

00:52:10.490 --> 00:52:13.940
guys still have a whole lot
more myelin to lay down there

00:52:13.940 --> 00:52:15.170
in the frontal cortex.

00:52:15.170 --> 00:52:17.920
It is the last part of the
brain to fully develop.

00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:21.270
Some immediate implications
of that-- if it

00:52:21.270 --> 00:52:24.000
is the last part of the
brain to develop, it is,

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:26.010
by definition, the
part of the brain

00:52:26.010 --> 00:52:28.480
least constrained by genes.

00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:32.280
And it is the part of the brain
most sculpted by environment

00:52:32.280 --> 00:52:35.510
and experience, which is
real interesting, given

00:52:35.510 --> 00:52:38.760
that it is the most definedly
human part of the brain.

00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:42.010
So frontal cortical development
in kids-- what we've already

00:52:42.010 --> 00:52:46.010
heard is by age 5 or
younger, get frontal damage,

00:52:46.010 --> 00:52:48.020
and you get this
acquired sociopathy.

00:52:48.020 --> 00:52:51.325
You don't get as clear of a
disassociation between you

00:52:51.325 --> 00:52:54.370
know what the rules are, you
simply can't carry them out.

00:52:54.370 --> 00:52:57.250
It's more of a mixed
bag at that point.

00:52:57.250 --> 00:52:59.890
Frontal development after
that-- the frontal cortex

00:52:59.890 --> 00:53:02.870
works in a very interesting,
perfectly logical way

00:53:02.870 --> 00:53:05.260
in teenagers, as follows.

00:53:05.260 --> 00:53:07.350
When you look at
frontal activity,

00:53:07.350 --> 00:53:08.940
and the extent to
which it is being

00:53:08.940 --> 00:53:12.060
driven by dopamine with one
of these brain scanners,

00:53:12.060 --> 00:53:14.730
take an adult, and
take a teenager.

00:53:14.730 --> 00:53:17.720
And they each have circumstances
where they're doing some task

00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:18.990
and they get a reward.

00:53:18.990 --> 00:53:21.270
And some of the time,
they get a smaller reward

00:53:21.270 --> 00:53:23.520
than they think they deserve
from the amount of effort

00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:24.270
they put in.

00:53:24.270 --> 00:53:27.710
And some of the time, they get
an unexpectedly large reward.

00:53:27.710 --> 00:53:30.920
Circumstance where the
individual gets a bigger reward

00:53:30.920 --> 00:53:34.210
than anticipated,
dopamine goes up in adults

00:53:34.210 --> 00:53:37.080
and drives frontal metabolism
to a certain extent.

00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:40.670
Dopamine goes up much
higher in the teenager.

00:53:40.670 --> 00:53:44.120
Now a circumstance where the
task is being carried out.

00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:46.480
And you don't get the reward.

00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:48.790
Dopamine goes down in the
adult, frontal metabolism

00:53:48.790 --> 00:53:49.820
goes down a bit.

00:53:49.820 --> 00:53:53.200
Dopamine goes down much
more in the teenager.

00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:56.070
The gyrations are
much more extreme.

00:53:56.070 --> 00:54:00.200
The dopamine-driven metabolic
changes in the frontal cortex

00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:02.950
are more dramatically
large for reward,

00:54:02.950 --> 00:54:05.860
are more dramatically
having the floor fall out

00:54:05.860 --> 00:54:08.880
under it for lack of
reward, for disappointment.

00:54:08.880 --> 00:54:11.970
It's a system that is
simply less regulated.

00:54:11.970 --> 00:54:14.700
And this, this fact that the
frontal cortex is the last

00:54:14.700 --> 00:54:18.070
maturing part of the brain, had
to do with one of the wisest

00:54:18.070 --> 00:54:20.360
things the Supreme Court
has done in a long time,

00:54:20.360 --> 00:54:23.470
which was about 10 years ago,
when they made a ruling that

00:54:23.470 --> 00:54:26.340
individuals who
are under age 18,

00:54:26.340 --> 00:54:28.770
when they carry out
a capital crime,

00:54:28.770 --> 00:54:31.880
you cannot have the death
penalty applied to someone

00:54:31.880 --> 00:54:35.130
for a crime they did
between ages 16 and 18,

00:54:35.130 --> 00:54:38.440
because explicitly stated
in the court decision,

00:54:38.440 --> 00:54:41.720
the brain and the regulatory
areas of the brain are not

00:54:41.720 --> 00:54:45.830
fully mature at that point--
the most neurologically informed

00:54:45.830 --> 00:54:47.800
the Supreme Court has
been in a long time.

00:54:47.800 --> 00:54:51.060
Again, the McNaughton rule--
the McNaughton rule, which

00:54:51.060 --> 00:54:53.940
is the backbone of the criminal
defense and legal system

00:54:53.940 --> 00:54:59.070
in this country, is based on
170-year-old neurobiology.

00:54:59.070 --> 00:55:02.216
So this was a major leap
forward in jurisprudence

00:55:02.216 --> 00:55:04.590
meets neurobiology in this
country with the Supreme Court

00:55:04.590 --> 00:55:05.160
ruling.

00:55:05.160 --> 00:55:08.080
Of course, what
one might ask is,

00:55:08.080 --> 00:55:10.630
so what exactly happens in
the brain on the morning

00:55:10.630 --> 00:55:12.800
of your 18th birthday
that now makes

00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:15.444
it OK to put you to death,
where the science simply

00:55:15.444 --> 00:55:16.110
doesn't back it?

00:55:16.110 --> 00:55:19.600
But at least that recognition,
the Supreme Court actually

00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:23.090
dealing with the fact that
a 17-year-old does not have

00:55:23.090 --> 00:55:25.930
a normal frontal cortex yet.

00:55:25.930 --> 00:55:28.330
What else goes on?

00:55:28.330 --> 00:55:31.210
Thus, by the time you get a
fully online frontal cortex,

00:55:31.210 --> 00:55:34.800
around age 25 or so, one of
the truly depressing things

00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:37.540
out the other end of it
is the frontal cortex

00:55:37.540 --> 00:55:42.790
is the third most vulnerable
brain region to normal aging--

00:55:42.790 --> 00:55:43.790
bummer.

00:55:43.790 --> 00:55:45.140
That is a drag.

00:55:45.140 --> 00:55:48.230
What that winds up meaning is
you have spectacular impulse

00:55:48.230 --> 00:55:50.070
control for about
three and a half weeks

00:55:50.070 --> 00:55:51.580
on your 25th birthday.

00:55:51.580 --> 00:55:53.356
And it's all
downhill from there.

00:55:53.356 --> 00:55:55.730
There's a motor system in the
brain called the substantia

00:55:55.730 --> 00:55:59.300
nigra which loses most of
its neurons with aging.

00:55:59.300 --> 00:56:01.520
That has something to do
with the tremor of old age,

00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:02.880
Parkinson's disease.

00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:06.310
The hippocampus lose substantial
percentage of its neurons

00:56:06.310 --> 00:56:06.870
with age.

00:56:06.870 --> 00:56:09.350
That has something to do with
some of the memory problems.

00:56:09.350 --> 00:56:12.410
Number three on the list
is the frontal cortex.

00:56:12.410 --> 00:56:15.200
Frontal cortex loses
lots of neurons

00:56:15.200 --> 00:56:16.640
over the course of aging.

00:56:16.640 --> 00:56:19.370
And what you see, then,
is all of those tests

00:56:19.370 --> 00:56:22.010
of cognitive function,
of frontal functioning,

00:56:22.010 --> 00:56:24.650
they all have to be
age-adjusted because people

00:56:24.650 --> 00:56:28.670
as they get older have more
trouble doing this, inhibiting

00:56:28.670 --> 00:56:31.590
the over-learned response,
preventing something

00:56:31.590 --> 00:56:33.270
from intruding previously.

00:56:33.270 --> 00:56:36.530
There's fewer of these
projections coming in there.

00:56:36.530 --> 00:56:38.470
And what does this
begin to explain?

00:56:38.470 --> 00:56:41.990
This is this whole world
of grandmothers telling you

00:56:41.990 --> 00:56:45.260
exactly how hideous they
think your new hairdo is.

00:56:45.260 --> 00:56:48.560
That's the world of disinhibited
80-year-olds speaking.

00:56:48.560 --> 00:56:51.150
And what has always been
the case in that literature,

00:56:51.150 --> 00:56:54.940
it has always been interpreted
in a social, psychological

00:56:54.940 --> 00:56:56.710
maturation framework.

00:56:56.710 --> 00:56:59.400
By the time you get
to a certain age,

00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:01.990
you finally accept,
this is who I am.

00:57:01.990 --> 00:57:05.040
I'm not in middle school anymore
just trying to be popular.

00:57:05.040 --> 00:57:07.140
If I need to march to
a different drummer,

00:57:07.140 --> 00:57:09.690
so be it, because I am
at peace with who I am.

00:57:09.690 --> 00:57:10.610
I accept myself.

00:57:10.610 --> 00:57:11.430
It's not that.

00:57:11.430 --> 00:57:12.770
It's the brain damage.

00:57:12.770 --> 00:57:16.320
It's the brain damage that kicks
in at that point, that being

00:57:16.320 --> 00:57:19.190
a feature of normative aging.

00:57:19.190 --> 00:57:22.220
Now, where else do you wind
up seeing abnormalities

00:57:22.220 --> 00:57:23.630
and frontal function?

00:57:23.630 --> 00:57:26.100
Other individuals,
individual differences--

00:57:26.100 --> 00:57:28.750
one personality
style where you see

00:57:28.750 --> 00:57:30.940
elevated frontal metabolism.

00:57:30.940 --> 00:57:32.620
And this is people
with what's called

00:57:32.620 --> 00:57:34.910
repressive personalities.

00:57:34.910 --> 00:57:38.840
These are individuals who
are highly regimented, highly

00:57:38.840 --> 00:57:43.150
disciplined, highly capable
of controlling their behavior.

00:57:43.150 --> 00:57:46.640
These are individuals who do not
express emotions very readily.

00:57:46.640 --> 00:57:49.810
They're very bad at reading
emotions in other people.

00:57:49.810 --> 00:57:50.830
They're not depressed.

00:57:50.830 --> 00:57:51.700
They're not anxious.

00:57:51.700 --> 00:57:54.590
In order to be labeled with
a repressive personality,

00:57:54.590 --> 00:57:55.740
those are rule-outs.

00:57:55.740 --> 00:57:58.240
You have an extremely
structured life.

00:57:58.240 --> 00:58:01.170
These are the people
who can tell you

00:58:01.170 --> 00:58:03.630
everything they're planning to
do for the next three years.

00:58:03.630 --> 00:58:05.090
And it's already scheduled out.

00:58:05.090 --> 00:58:07.770
This is the roommate who
always has all the work

00:58:07.770 --> 00:58:09.717
done three weeks
before the due date.

00:58:09.717 --> 00:58:11.300
This is the person
who makes you crazy

00:58:11.300 --> 00:58:13.341
because you wish you could
be half as disciplined

00:58:13.341 --> 00:58:14.230
as they are.

00:58:14.230 --> 00:58:16.410
People with
personalities like this,

00:58:16.410 --> 00:58:20.600
elevated resting metabolism
in the frontal cortex.

00:58:20.600 --> 00:58:24.520
So which sort of people have
far lower than normal metabolism

00:58:24.520 --> 00:58:26.390
in the frontal cortex?

00:58:26.390 --> 00:58:27.260
Any guesses?

00:58:27.260 --> 00:58:27.990
Shout out.

00:58:31.336 --> 00:58:32.770
Thrill seekers.

00:58:32.770 --> 00:58:35.180
Thrill seekers,
yeah-- thrill seekers,

00:58:35.180 --> 00:58:37.890
it seems to be more at the
dopamine end of things.

00:58:37.890 --> 00:58:41.170
And the zebra book considers
that at one point in there.

00:58:41.170 --> 00:58:43.400
When it's more
manifest in, how are

00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:45.630
you going to pull
off stuff like this,

00:58:45.630 --> 00:58:49.530
sociopaths have much lower
than normal metabolic rates

00:58:49.530 --> 00:58:50.732
in the frontal cortex.

00:58:50.732 --> 00:58:52.190
In fact, in a couple
of weeks there

00:58:52.190 --> 00:58:53.930
is a guy coming to
give a lecture--

00:58:53.930 --> 00:58:55.786
and I'll announce in
here when and where--

00:58:55.786 --> 00:58:57.410
who is one of the
people doing the most

00:58:57.410 --> 00:58:58.580
interesting work with this.

00:58:58.580 --> 00:59:01.800
What this guy has is a
functional MRI machine

00:59:01.800 --> 00:59:03.990
on a trailer, which
he drives around

00:59:03.990 --> 00:59:06.460
from one maximum security
prison to another

00:59:06.460 --> 00:59:09.560
throughout this country--
really interesting research

00:59:09.560 --> 00:59:13.390
on violent individuals who
are or aren't sociopathic,

00:59:13.390 --> 00:59:15.780
decreased frontal metabolism.

00:59:15.780 --> 00:59:17.170
But now something interesting.

00:59:17.170 --> 00:59:20.530
You take a sociopath whose
resting metabolic rate

00:59:20.530 --> 00:59:23.680
in the frontal cortex
is lower than normal.

00:59:23.680 --> 00:59:27.480
Now you give them a task
which demands a certain degree

00:59:27.480 --> 00:59:29.070
of frontal function.

00:59:29.070 --> 00:59:32.090
Not, oh, be a law abiding
citizen in society,

00:59:32.090 --> 00:59:34.270
but something like the
tell the months of the year

00:59:34.270 --> 00:59:36.330
backwards as fast as you can go.

00:59:36.330 --> 00:59:38.990
And what you see is
in order to generate

00:59:38.990 --> 00:59:42.060
the same level of
performance, they

00:59:42.060 --> 00:59:44.590
have to activate more
of the frontal cortex

00:59:44.590 --> 00:59:45.835
than other people do.

00:59:45.835 --> 00:59:48.980
In other words, under
resting circumstances,

00:59:48.980 --> 00:59:52.480
there is a hypometabolism
in the frontal cortex.

00:59:52.480 --> 00:59:55.990
And in the rare, relatively
unemotional circumstances

00:59:55.990 --> 00:59:59.610
where a sociopath does want to
pull off a lot of regulation

00:59:59.610 --> 01:00:02.280
of behavior, they've got
to recruit a lot more

01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:04.200
of the frontal cortex to do it.

01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:07.040
It takes more work to do.

01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:09.230
Other aspects of
frontal cortex--

01:00:09.230 --> 01:00:12.110
not only are kids not
dealing with a whole lot

01:00:12.110 --> 01:00:13.220
of frontal cortex.

01:00:13.220 --> 01:00:15.340
Other species are not
dealing with a whole lot

01:00:15.340 --> 01:00:16.600
of frontal cortex.

01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:19.670
Again, humans have more
frontal cortex proportionately

01:00:19.670 --> 01:00:21.150
than any other species.

01:00:21.150 --> 01:00:23.400
There is no chimpanzee
on Earth who

01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:26.330
could master the five
M&amp;M, one M&amp;M task.

01:00:26.330 --> 01:00:29.370
And that is regularly used as
a test for frontal function

01:00:29.370 --> 01:00:29.900
on them.

01:00:29.900 --> 01:00:34.010
Chimps cannot do it because it
is simply too tempting to reach

01:00:34.010 --> 01:00:37.950
for the five M&amp;Md
because it's right there.

01:00:37.950 --> 01:00:41.670
Interesting assay of how many
frontal neurons a chimp does

01:00:41.670 --> 01:00:46.320
have, though, which is now
instead of 5 M&amp;Ms and 1 M&amp;M,

01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:49.200
five chips of wood
and one chip of wood.

01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:53.420
Reach for the five chips
of wood, you get one M&amp;M.

01:00:53.420 --> 01:00:57.480
Reach for the one chip of
wood, you get five M&amp;Ms.

01:00:57.480 --> 01:00:59.080
Every chimp can do it now.

01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:01.350
They can all do it now
because they're just looking

01:01:01.350 --> 01:01:02.591
at these pieces of wood.

01:01:02.591 --> 01:01:04.090
And they can remember,
that's right.

01:01:04.090 --> 01:01:05.540
Don't go for the
five pieces of wood.

01:01:05.540 --> 01:01:06.748
Go for the one piece of wood.

01:01:06.748 --> 01:01:08.720
When it's chocolate,
though, in front of them,

01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:11.290
it's smells so great.

01:01:11.290 --> 01:01:14.110
And how can you expect them
to keep track of the rules?

01:01:14.110 --> 01:01:15.862
And it's just the five.

01:01:15.862 --> 01:01:18.070
And before you know it,
they've done the wrong thing.

01:01:18.070 --> 01:01:20.770
If you take away some
of the viscera of it,

01:01:20.770 --> 01:01:24.210
if you step back sensorially,
if you substitute

01:01:24.210 --> 01:01:27.190
this in your face chocolate
for these little bits of wood,

01:01:27.190 --> 01:01:29.870
chimps on the average have
enough frontal function

01:01:29.870 --> 01:01:33.300
to be able to pull
that task off.

01:01:33.300 --> 01:01:35.330
Kids, again, could
never do this.

01:01:35.330 --> 01:01:38.090
And this is one classic
sort of developmental test.

01:01:38.090 --> 01:01:39.130
You take a kid.

01:01:39.130 --> 01:01:40.390
And they're in a room.

01:01:40.390 --> 01:01:42.080
And you put a marshmallow there.

01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:46.010
And you say, OK, does
people know this one?

01:01:46.010 --> 01:01:49.700
OK, so do people
now know this one?

01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:50.880
OK, so here's what you do.

01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:52.130
You put the marshmallow there.

01:01:52.130 --> 01:01:54.132
And you tell the child,
OK, I've got to go out

01:01:54.132 --> 01:01:55.340
of the room for a little bit.

01:01:55.340 --> 01:01:57.214
You can have a marshmallow
whenever you want.

01:01:57.214 --> 01:01:59.960
But if you haven't had it
by the time I come back,

01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:01.370
you can have two marshmallows.

01:02:01.370 --> 01:02:03.670
In other words,
how many synapses

01:02:03.670 --> 01:02:05.850
do you have in your
frontal cortex?

01:02:05.850 --> 01:02:08.740
Because that is
spectacularly predictive

01:02:08.740 --> 01:02:11.230
of frontal metabolism
in these kids.

01:02:11.230 --> 01:02:15.160
How long can they hold out
doing the harder thing that

01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:16.570
gets more of a reward?

01:02:16.570 --> 01:02:18.310
What those studies
also were showing

01:02:18.310 --> 01:02:20.850
is the length of time
a kid could hold out

01:02:20.850 --> 01:02:23.370
on the marshmallow test
when they're five years old

01:02:23.370 --> 01:02:27.410
is predictive of SAT
scores many years later,

01:02:27.410 --> 01:02:31.620
is predictive of all sorts
of aspects of the trajectory

01:02:31.620 --> 01:02:34.520
of that frontal development.

01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:37.390
Here's an even better assay
for frontal function in a kid.

01:02:37.390 --> 01:02:40.287
And this one, I think this
is even more informative

01:02:40.287 --> 01:02:41.370
than the marshmallow test.

01:02:41.370 --> 01:02:42.350
Here's what you do.

01:02:42.350 --> 01:02:43.600
You've got your five-year-old.

01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:46.310
And you play hide
and seek with them.

01:02:46.310 --> 01:02:49.160
And the deal is you're
the one who counts first

01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:50.160
while they go and hide.

01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:51.870
And what you do is
you finish counting.

01:02:51.870 --> 01:02:54.850
And then you loudly,
excitedly say, here I come.

01:02:54.850 --> 01:02:55.351
Here I come.

01:02:55.351 --> 01:02:56.225
I'm going to get you.

01:02:56.225 --> 01:02:56.880
Here I come.

01:02:56.880 --> 01:02:58.150
Oh, where are you?

01:02:58.150 --> 01:03:01.070
And then they instantly say,
right here under the piano,

01:03:01.070 --> 01:03:03.380
because they don't have
enough frontal neurons to keep

01:03:03.380 --> 01:03:04.607
themselves from saying that.

01:03:04.607 --> 01:03:06.690
They can't stop themselves
from saying, here I am.

01:03:06.690 --> 01:03:08.000
Here I am, falling for that.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.250
Now, they switch.

01:03:09.250 --> 01:03:10.730
And it's their turn to count.

01:03:10.730 --> 01:03:11.450
And they count.

01:03:11.450 --> 01:03:12.480
You count up to 10.

01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:15.940
And they go 7, 8, 9,
10, 11, 12, 13, 14,

01:03:15.940 --> 01:03:18.460
because they're so excited
to have discovered recently

01:03:18.460 --> 01:03:23.250
there's all these numbers, that
why not count all of them off?

01:03:23.250 --> 01:03:26.450
And they've long forgotten
you're supposed to stop at 10.

01:03:26.450 --> 01:03:28.630
They can't inhibit
that response.

01:03:28.630 --> 01:03:31.810
This is what frontal function
looks like in a kid--

01:03:31.810 --> 01:03:34.680
so marshmallow tests
and hide and seek tests.

01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:37.220
How's this, though, for
taking that charming world

01:03:37.220 --> 01:03:39.680
of five-year-old
regulation and putting it

01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:43.440
into a much more depressing
developmental context?

01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:49.200
Studies by now showing at age 5,
already kindergarten-aged kids,

01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:52.660
there is a relationship between
your socioeconomic status

01:03:52.660 --> 01:03:55.240
and the thickness of
your frontal cortex

01:03:55.240 --> 01:03:57.910
and its resting metabolic rate.

01:03:57.910 --> 01:03:59.420
What's the part
of the brain that

01:03:59.420 --> 01:04:01.690
has some of the highest
levels of receptors

01:04:01.690 --> 01:04:03.410
for glucocorticoids?

01:04:03.410 --> 01:04:04.870
The frontal cortex.

01:04:04.870 --> 01:04:08.060
What do glucocorticoids
do to the frontal cortex?

01:04:08.060 --> 01:04:10.200
They atrophy neurons there.

01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:12.240
So what you are
already seeing is,

01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:15.450
get yourself an unfortunate,
imprudent decision

01:04:15.450 --> 01:04:18.300
in terms of which family
you got yourself born into.

01:04:18.300 --> 01:04:20.630
And be raised with
the stress of poverty.

01:04:20.630 --> 01:04:24.380
And by age 5, already there
are socioeconomic differences

01:04:24.380 --> 01:04:27.570
in the size and the activity
of the frontal cortex.

01:04:27.570 --> 01:04:30.580
And that is, I think, one
of those factoids that

01:04:30.580 --> 01:04:33.830
should have people rioting
at the barricades in terms

01:04:33.830 --> 01:04:38.010
of how screwed you are, how
early on in life in the most

01:04:38.010 --> 01:04:41.460
straight forwardly
neurobiological way by some

01:04:41.460 --> 01:04:45.370
of these oddities of
experience and bad luck.

01:04:45.370 --> 01:04:49.640
OK, so looking finally at the
frontal cortex-- one thing

01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:54.120
to ask at the end of the day
is, so, frontal disinhibition?

01:04:54.120 --> 01:04:57.490
Why don't you see with people
with massive frontal damage,

01:04:57.490 --> 01:04:59.610
instead of them becoming
serial murderers,

01:04:59.610 --> 01:05:03.060
why don't they become like
serial people getting married?

01:05:03.060 --> 01:05:06.530
Why aren't they serial standing
on street corners giving away

01:05:06.530 --> 01:05:09.540
their money and announcing
their love to the whole world,

01:05:09.540 --> 01:05:12.890
and doing equally disinhibited
things in that realm?

01:05:12.890 --> 01:05:13.890
It's not clear.

01:05:13.890 --> 01:05:17.910
It's not clear why this is
so much more tightly involved

01:05:17.910 --> 01:05:21.150
in regulation of stuff
going on in the amygdala.

01:05:21.150 --> 01:05:24.080
OK, so as implied,
though, by this arrow,

01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:26.730
it is not one direction
of inputs there.

01:05:26.730 --> 01:05:28.160
It is bidirectional.

01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:32.000
What you also see is a lot of
ways in which the amygdala can

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:33.970
regulate the frontal cortex.

01:05:33.970 --> 01:05:36.350
And what you already can
guess is the projection

01:05:36.350 --> 01:05:39.600
from the frontal cortex to
the amygdala is inhibitory.

01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:42.720
The projection from the
amygdala to the frontal cortex

01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:44.260
is inhibitory.

01:05:44.260 --> 01:05:46.910
The frontal cortex is
trying to get the amygdala

01:05:46.910 --> 01:05:48.680
to restrain itself.

01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:51.160
The amygdala is trying
to get the frontal cortex

01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:53.000
to stop sermonizing at it.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:56.160
And what you wind up seeing
is in rats, in primates,

01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:59.160
and humans there is
an inverse correlation

01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:02.480
under resting conditions
between the metabolic level

01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:04.850
in the amygdala and
the frontal cortex.

01:06:04.850 --> 01:06:08.310
They move in opposition.

01:06:08.310 --> 01:06:11.540
And what you see is, what
are the circumstances where,

01:06:11.540 --> 01:06:15.230
in effect, the amygdala is going
crazy enough to be silencing

01:06:15.230 --> 01:06:16.620
the frontal cortex?

01:06:16.620 --> 01:06:18.170
That's the world
in which you are

01:06:18.170 --> 01:06:22.230
making astonishingly bad
decisions about things

01:06:22.230 --> 01:06:24.600
during moments of great
duress and arousal

01:06:24.600 --> 01:06:26.750
that you spend the rest
of your life regretting.

01:06:26.750 --> 01:06:30.780
That's the world of the amygdala
getting very inaccurate, rapid

01:06:30.780 --> 01:06:34.870
fire information, and being able
to silence the frontal cortex.

01:06:34.870 --> 01:06:38.730
And then out comes behavior
that is really unregulated.

01:06:38.730 --> 01:06:41.380
The frontal cortex and
the amygdala, in a sense,

01:06:41.380 --> 01:06:46.150
constantly wrestling in
terms of their reciprocity.

01:06:46.150 --> 01:06:48.950
So what happens when
somebody has learned

01:06:48.950 --> 01:06:50.390
to be afraid of something?

01:06:50.390 --> 01:06:53.740
And slowly, over time, they
learn that, in fact, this thing

01:06:53.740 --> 01:06:55.300
is not fearful?

01:06:55.300 --> 01:06:59.120
They habituate to this
fear-conditioned response.

01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:02.060
They habituate to yoking.

01:07:02.060 --> 01:07:04.700
This buzzer means I'm
going to get a shock.

01:07:04.700 --> 01:07:06.600
They extinguish the behavior.

01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:08.380
That's the term given for that.

01:07:08.380 --> 01:07:11.660
You gradually see the amygdala
activates less and less.

01:07:11.660 --> 01:07:13.479
Oh, play the buzzer,
play the tone,

01:07:13.479 --> 01:07:15.770
that you've been conditioned
to associate with a shock.

01:07:15.770 --> 01:07:17.560
Amygdala goes crazy.

01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:19.810
No shock this time,
do the buzzer again,

01:07:19.810 --> 01:07:21.560
no shock, not quite as active.

01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:25.010
Next time, not quite as active,
and it slowly habituates away.

01:07:25.010 --> 01:07:27.600
Destroy the frontal
cortex, and the amygdala

01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:30.820
never habituates to
a learned response,

01:07:30.820 --> 01:07:34.350
a fear-conditioned response
which is no longer fearful.

01:07:34.350 --> 01:07:37.200
It can't learn to
stop being afraid--

01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:40.750
so another realm of this
reciprocal inhibitory

01:07:40.750 --> 01:07:46.430
relationship between the
frontal cortex and the amygdala.

01:07:46.430 --> 01:07:50.030
OK, final bit here in terms
of their interactions--

01:07:50.030 --> 01:07:53.410
the easiest way to frame it
is, each inhibits the other.

01:07:53.410 --> 01:07:55.000
They work reciprocally.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:58.490
There are circumstances, though,
where both the frontal cortex

01:07:58.490 --> 01:08:02.030
and the amygdala will activate
because all you have to think

01:08:02.030 --> 01:08:04.850
are of some circumstances
where whatever

01:08:04.850 --> 01:08:08.770
your cultural conditioning is,
doing the harder thing, which

01:08:08.770 --> 01:08:11.980
is the right thing, is
also the scarier thing.

01:08:11.980 --> 01:08:14.540
Just think what it takes to
have somebody blow a whistle.

01:08:14.540 --> 01:08:17.729
And you leap up over the top
of your trench in World War I.

01:08:17.729 --> 01:08:19.810
And you're going
to be dead 10 steps

01:08:19.810 --> 01:08:22.029
into running towards
the other trench line.

01:08:22.029 --> 01:08:24.279
At some point,
the frontal cortex

01:08:24.279 --> 01:08:27.840
is, in fact, stimulating
the amygdala very strongly

01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:29.490
to produce its behaviors.

01:08:29.490 --> 01:08:32.240
That's showing a circumstance
where that is, indeed,

01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:33.160
the harder behavior.

01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:37.200
It is simplifying to say that
they always work in opposition.

01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:39.399
But as a general rule,
that's happening.

01:08:39.399 --> 01:08:42.689
OK, what this allows us
do now is step back a bit

01:08:42.689 --> 01:08:45.430
and now look at another
brain region, one

01:08:45.430 --> 01:08:48.270
which is in effect
working in opposition

01:08:48.270 --> 01:08:52.199
to the amygdala in another
realm, which is the septum.

01:08:52.199 --> 01:08:53.720
And you remember the septum.

01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:57.229
The hippocampus sends its
loop through the fornix

01:08:57.229 --> 01:08:58.710
down to that septum thing.

01:08:58.710 --> 01:09:02.100
In some manner, the septum
inhibits aggression.

01:09:02.100 --> 01:09:04.760
In the same way that,
simplistically, the amygdala

01:09:04.760 --> 01:09:07.590
mediates it, the exact
same sort of evidence,

01:09:07.590 --> 01:09:10.960
lesion studies, stimulation
studies, recording studies.

01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:13.100
For reasons I don't
fully understand,

01:09:13.100 --> 01:09:15.460
the septum has never
been really a hot spot

01:09:15.460 --> 01:09:16.790
for a lot of research.

01:09:16.790 --> 01:09:19.680
Nonetheless, it, in some
ways, works in opposition

01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:20.920
to the amygdala.

01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:23.410
You could now sit with
one of those circuit

01:09:23.410 --> 01:09:26.800
diagrams of the limbic system
seeing who's connecting to who.

01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:29.060
And you could see
what sort of wiring

01:09:29.060 --> 01:09:31.090
there must be for
the septum to try

01:09:31.090 --> 01:09:35.080
to silence the amygdala, what
the circuitry there would be.

01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:37.810
Back to that limbic rule,
all these limbic structures

01:09:37.810 --> 01:09:39.910
are trying to yell
at the hypothalamus

01:09:39.910 --> 01:09:43.630
and get it to listen to them
and not to the other regions.

01:09:43.630 --> 01:09:45.950
Another area implicated
in aggression--

01:09:45.950 --> 01:09:50.450
the lateral
hypothalamus, subject

01:09:50.450 --> 01:09:53.220
of a huge amount of research
in the 1960s, people

01:09:53.220 --> 01:09:54.470
interested in aggression.

01:09:54.470 --> 01:09:56.984
And then people acted
like ethologists

01:09:56.984 --> 01:09:58.650
and learned the thing
that we've already

01:09:58.650 --> 01:10:02.160
talked about a bit in here,
which is, oh, actually

01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:04.980
the lateral hypothalamus has
nothing to do with aggression.

01:10:04.980 --> 01:10:07.070
It's got to do with
predatory behavior.

01:10:07.070 --> 01:10:10.090
When a rat leaps on a
mouse and shreds it,

01:10:10.090 --> 01:10:11.570
that's not an act of aggression.

01:10:11.570 --> 01:10:13.380
That's an act of foraging.

01:10:13.380 --> 01:10:18.680
Oh, lateral hypothalamus, food
acquisition, not aggression.

01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:21.700
Tons of research in the
'60s went down the tubes

01:10:21.700 --> 01:10:24.600
when people began
to figure that out.

01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:27.670
Now flipping to the other
side of all of this stuff

01:10:27.670 --> 01:10:30.800
rather than the aggression
realm, the empathy realm,

01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:33.870
the compassionate realm-- where
are the structures coming in?

01:10:33.870 --> 01:10:36.450
And we already know
one area from the sex

01:10:36.450 --> 01:10:38.130
lectures that is
pertinent, which

01:10:38.130 --> 01:10:41.230
is the anterior
cingulate, sitting just

01:10:41.230 --> 01:10:42.970
behind the frontal cortex.

01:10:42.970 --> 01:10:45.550
And we already know about some
of the things that it does.

01:10:45.550 --> 01:10:47.540
Remember, that's the
part of the brain,

01:10:47.540 --> 01:10:51.600
somebody pokes your finger, it
activates, along with your pain

01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:53.060
receptor pathways.

01:10:53.060 --> 01:10:56.090
You watch the finger of your
loved on gets poked with a pin,

01:10:56.090 --> 01:10:58.910
anterior cingulate
activates as well.

01:10:58.910 --> 01:11:02.120
That is the part of the brain
where, literally and not just

01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:06.490
metaphorically, you feel the
pain of other individuals.

01:11:06.490 --> 01:11:07.670
How is this?

01:11:07.670 --> 01:11:10.400
Now, a study-- this was done
recently by a guy at Harvard

01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:11.420
named Josh Green.

01:11:11.420 --> 01:11:14.770
What he does is he puts people
in brain scanners, functional

01:11:14.770 --> 01:11:15.470
MRIs.

01:11:15.470 --> 01:11:18.890
And he gives them one of
the great, horrifying moral

01:11:18.890 --> 01:11:21.270
decisions that ever
sort of actually

01:11:21.270 --> 01:11:24.660
occurred in history, which
was the old scenario that

01:11:24.660 --> 01:11:28.140
and a bunch of people are hiding
from the Nazis who are nearby.

01:11:28.140 --> 01:11:30.020
And there is a baby with you.

01:11:30.020 --> 01:11:31.760
And the baby who keeps crying.

01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:33.370
And it is clear
if the baby keeps

01:11:33.370 --> 01:11:35.880
crying you are all going
to be caught and killed.

01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:38.110
Is it OK to smother the child?

01:11:38.110 --> 01:11:40.370
And this wonderfully
hypothetical,

01:11:40.370 --> 01:11:42.590
let's write a doctoral
thesis dissertation

01:11:42.590 --> 01:11:44.620
on this problem
here, was one which

01:11:44.620 --> 01:11:46.810
was a human sort
of decision that

01:11:46.810 --> 01:11:48.900
had to be made endless
number of times.

01:11:48.900 --> 01:11:51.240
What would you do in
that circumstance?

01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:53.260
And what he shows
in these studies

01:11:53.260 --> 01:11:57.610
are that people who activate
the anterior cingulate less

01:11:57.610 --> 01:11:59.930
when they are
contemplating this decision

01:11:59.930 --> 01:12:02.380
are more likely to reach
the decision that it

01:12:02.380 --> 01:12:04.740
is OK to smother the child.

01:12:04.740 --> 01:12:08.730
You see that in these studies,
something about the feeling

01:12:08.730 --> 01:12:11.970
the pain element,
the empathizing,

01:12:11.970 --> 01:12:14.920
something about that,
when it is not as extreme,

01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:17.810
that it is a predictor in these
studies of the individuals

01:12:17.810 --> 01:12:20.030
who will vote for
the smothering.

01:12:20.030 --> 01:12:22.740
All of this has given
rise to this view

01:12:22.740 --> 01:12:25.970
that a lot of what's
happening between the cortex

01:12:25.970 --> 01:12:28.970
and the limbic system is a
whole lot more complicated

01:12:28.970 --> 01:12:32.807
than this old dichotomy
between thought and emotion.

01:12:32.807 --> 01:12:34.140
And the cortex is about thought.

01:12:34.140 --> 01:12:35.910
And the limbic system
is about emotion.

01:12:35.910 --> 01:12:39.000
What is clear is, instead,
they are inseparable.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:40.900
This whole notion
brought up already,

01:12:40.900 --> 01:12:44.400
that Guy Damasio, major figure
in the field, this book of his

01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:46.200
called Descartes'
Error, where he

01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:50.310
goes over Descartes' notion
of the separability of thought

01:12:50.310 --> 01:12:52.720
and emotion, and how in
terms of brain function

01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:54.770
that is not remotely the case.

01:12:54.770 --> 01:12:57.290
In some realms,
you can partially

01:12:57.290 --> 01:13:01.780
separate frontal cortical
function from limbic function.

01:13:01.780 --> 01:13:04.780
One example of this-- and
this was a classic study done

01:13:04.780 --> 01:13:06.397
by that same guy, Josh Green.

01:13:06.397 --> 01:13:08.480
And this was when he was
still a graduate student.

01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:11.430
It involved making use of
people with a brain scanner

01:13:11.430 --> 01:13:13.950
with what's apparently
a classic test

01:13:13.950 --> 01:13:16.140
in, or a classic
puzzle in, philosophy--

01:13:16.140 --> 01:13:18.620
the runaway trolley problem.

01:13:18.620 --> 01:13:20.220
Here's the scenario.

01:13:20.220 --> 01:13:22.110
There is a trolley
which is somehow

01:13:22.110 --> 01:13:23.650
broken loose from its brake.

01:13:23.650 --> 01:13:25.490
It is rolling down
the tracks, where

01:13:25.490 --> 01:13:29.180
it is going to roll over
there and kill five people.

01:13:29.180 --> 01:13:31.560
First scenario,
you have a choice.

01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:34.880
You can pull a lever, which
will cause the trolley

01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:36.960
to be diverted onto a
different track, where

01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:38.710
it will kill one person.

01:13:38.710 --> 01:13:42.540
Is it OK to pull the lever,
saving these five people,

01:13:42.540 --> 01:13:44.530
and one person getting killed?

01:13:44.530 --> 01:13:47.160
Second scenario, you
have the option--

01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:49.590
you're standing behind
this big beefy person.

01:13:49.590 --> 01:13:52.580
And you can push him onto the
track, where the trolley will

01:13:52.580 --> 01:13:53.810
hit them and kill them.

01:13:53.810 --> 01:13:57.350
But it will stop it from
hitting the five people.

01:13:57.350 --> 01:14:01.200
Are you willing to kill one
person in order to save five?

01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:03.860
And something that is shown
in these studies over and over

01:14:03.860 --> 01:14:08.080
is 75% of people are
willing to pull the lever.

01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:11.640
25% of people or so or
willing with their own hands

01:14:11.640 --> 01:14:13.560
to push somebody onto the track.

01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:16.410
The math, the logic,
is absolutely equal.

01:14:16.410 --> 01:14:18.860
But this is always
interpreted as how

01:14:18.860 --> 01:14:20.730
we make different
sorts of decisions

01:14:20.730 --> 01:14:23.700
when it is a much more
visceral, in your face,

01:14:23.700 --> 01:14:27.020
you are going to have to
push this person to his death

01:14:27.020 --> 01:14:28.870
with your own hands,
versus something

01:14:28.870 --> 01:14:31.850
as impersonal as
pulling a lever sitting

01:14:31.850 --> 01:14:35.200
in a cockpit in a military
base in Las Vegas,

01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:37.360
and killing people on the
other side of the globe.

01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:39.760
How salient, in your face is it?

01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:42.780
You get very
different responses.

01:14:42.780 --> 01:14:45.110
And what Green showed
in his study was,

01:14:45.110 --> 01:14:47.180
have people contemplating
whether or not

01:14:47.180 --> 01:14:50.450
to pull the lever, it's the
cortex that's activating--

01:14:50.450 --> 01:14:52.320
predominantly frontal cortex.

01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:55.420
Have people decide whether or
not to push with their hands,

01:14:55.420 --> 01:14:58.347
it's predominately
limbic activation.

01:14:58.347 --> 01:15:00.430
Another version of this--
this has been researched

01:15:00.430 --> 01:15:02.920
by a guy at Dartmouth named
Oliver Goodenough-- again,

01:15:02.920 --> 01:15:03.990
brain imaging.

01:15:03.990 --> 01:15:06.750
And he is both a neurobiologist
and also on the law

01:15:06.750 --> 01:15:08.040
school faculty there.

01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:09.720
And here's the sort
of study he does.

01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:11.780
You will see the
equivalency of it.

01:15:11.780 --> 01:15:13.060
Put people in a scanner.

01:15:13.060 --> 01:15:15.790
And they've been going
through a mock jury trial.

01:15:15.790 --> 01:15:18.020
And what they now
receive on the scanner

01:15:18.020 --> 01:15:20.690
are the judge's
orders to the jury

01:15:20.690 --> 01:15:22.560
before they go and deliberate.

01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:26.460
First version, the judge says,
remember what you are here for.

01:15:26.460 --> 01:15:27.636
You may have your feelings.

01:15:27.636 --> 01:15:30.260
You may have your feelings about
the person, and what they did,

01:15:30.260 --> 01:15:31.390
or what they didn't do.

01:15:31.390 --> 01:15:35.390
But at the end of the day, your
job as a juror now deliberating

01:15:35.390 --> 01:15:39.440
is simply to decide, was
this law violated or not?

01:15:39.440 --> 01:15:42.060
This is not for you to decide
if it's a good law or not.

01:15:42.060 --> 01:15:45.030
This is simply, was
this law broken?

01:15:45.030 --> 01:15:48.082
Second scenario, the judge
stands there and says, OK,

01:15:48.082 --> 01:15:49.540
as you go and
deliberate, remember,

01:15:49.540 --> 01:15:50.665
of course, what the law is.

01:15:50.665 --> 01:15:53.470
But, remember, at the end of the
day, what is this system about?

01:15:53.470 --> 01:15:56.410
It is about protecting the
weak from the powerful.

01:15:56.410 --> 01:15:59.060
And you are a decision
maker at this point-- two

01:15:59.060 --> 01:15:59.990
totally different.

01:15:59.990 --> 01:16:01.330
One is rule bound.

01:16:01.330 --> 01:16:02.690
On is empathy bound.

01:16:02.690 --> 01:16:06.040
People get the first sets of
rules, cortex is activating.

01:16:06.040 --> 01:16:09.040
Second set of rules, limbic
system is activating.

01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:11.160
So those are some domains
where, in fact, they

01:16:11.160 --> 01:16:13.170
are quite separable.

01:16:13.170 --> 01:16:15.490
What you see,
though, is that there

01:16:15.490 --> 01:16:18.490
are all sorts of domains
in which it is a completely

01:16:18.490 --> 01:16:21.650
ridiculous dichotomy
to make between, oh,

01:16:21.650 --> 01:16:25.280
pure abstract cognitive
decisions, and these messy,

01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:28.100
yucky, emotive limbic
sorts of ones--

01:16:28.100 --> 01:16:31.820
instead, tremendous amounts of
interactions between the two.

01:16:31.820 --> 01:16:34.450
One domain where
you see this, which

01:16:34.450 --> 01:16:37.390
is what happens when
you begin to damage

01:16:37.390 --> 01:16:38.510
some of these structures?

01:16:38.510 --> 01:16:41.860
You change the flavor of
the decisions that are made.

01:16:41.860 --> 01:16:44.110
Get people with frontal damage.

01:16:44.110 --> 01:16:46.880
And give them the
runaway trolley problem.

01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:49.330
And they are far more
likely to say, yes,

01:16:49.330 --> 01:16:52.570
it is OK to push
somebody onto the tracks.

01:16:52.570 --> 01:16:56.200
They get a far more
utilitarian decision.

01:16:56.200 --> 01:16:58.770
Equally interesting, and
the same sort of punch line,

01:16:58.770 --> 01:17:01.240
studies where a technique
that's now just being worked out

01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:03.340
called transmagnetic
stimulation,

01:17:03.340 --> 01:17:06.140
were you can
decrease the activity

01:17:06.140 --> 01:17:09.520
of certain cortical regions for
a couple of minutes at a time.

01:17:09.520 --> 01:17:13.260
Turn off one sub region of
the frontal cortex in people,

01:17:13.260 --> 01:17:14.250
in volunteers.

01:17:14.250 --> 01:17:16.890
And in various game theory
games that they're doing,

01:17:16.890 --> 01:17:19.500
they become a lot
more utilitarian.

01:17:19.500 --> 01:17:21.620
They become a lot more selfish.

01:17:21.620 --> 01:17:24.920
So modulating interactions
between there,

01:17:24.920 --> 01:17:27.070
cross talk between the two.

01:17:27.070 --> 01:17:29.530
In some ways the most
interesting demonstration

01:17:29.530 --> 01:17:32.040
for me of the ways in which
these are not separable,

01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:34.580
this thought from
emotion stuff, is

01:17:34.580 --> 01:17:36.790
this really interesting
domain of how

01:17:36.790 --> 01:17:39.360
the human brain does metaphor.

01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:41.350
OK, so we get to symbols.

01:17:41.350 --> 01:17:42.920
We get to abstract things.

01:17:42.920 --> 01:17:46.310
We get into a world where
we have a legal system

01:17:46.310 --> 01:17:49.080
where not only can we judge
that somebody has done something

01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:51.960
wrong to somebody else, if they
have murdered them, or stolen

01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:53.000
their possessions.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.930
But they can be viewed as having
done something transgressive

01:17:55.930 --> 01:17:59.120
if they've ruined the
reputation of somebody else,

01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:02.980
if they've stolen the ideas
of somebody else, plagiarism.

01:18:02.980 --> 01:18:06.200
This is a very abstract
world of judgments we have.

01:18:06.200 --> 01:18:08.850
These are very symbolic
realms of decision

01:18:08.850 --> 01:18:10.890
making we are often into.

01:18:10.890 --> 01:18:13.330
Yet, we have this
problem that we

01:18:13.330 --> 01:18:17.520
have this very old evolutionary
brain that did not necessarily

01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:20.430
evolve for doing
symbols and metaphors.

01:18:20.430 --> 01:18:22.190
And one of the things
you wind of seeing

01:18:22.190 --> 01:18:25.080
is when the brain
evolved the ability

01:18:25.080 --> 01:18:27.620
to do some of this more
metaphorical stuff,

01:18:27.620 --> 01:18:31.050
it had to make use of the
old circuitry that was there.

01:18:31.050 --> 01:18:32.980
And, thus, what
you wind up seeing

01:18:32.980 --> 01:18:37.350
is very often when dealing
with extremely abstract issues

01:18:37.350 --> 01:18:39.550
of decision making,
we treat some

01:18:39.550 --> 01:18:41.610
of the metaphorical
components as

01:18:41.610 --> 01:18:43.870
if they were absolutely real.

01:18:43.870 --> 01:18:45.720
What would be an
example of this?

01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:50.000
Here's one very cool study
that was done recently.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:53.170
So your body and your
brain is very wired

01:18:53.170 --> 01:18:55.700
up for doing
temperature regulation.

01:18:55.700 --> 01:18:56.730
Oh, this is hot.

01:18:56.730 --> 01:18:57.660
This is cold.

01:18:57.660 --> 01:18:59.070
These are different
temperatures.

01:18:59.070 --> 01:19:02.330
There's a whole metric,
in temperature-sensitive

01:19:02.330 --> 01:19:03.340
receptors.

01:19:03.340 --> 01:19:05.330
And there's a whole
circuitry thing.

01:19:05.330 --> 01:19:08.080
And it's going about
the very physical task

01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:10.530
in the very real world
of telling something

01:19:10.530 --> 01:19:13.970
about temperature oscillation
of ions, or whatever.

01:19:13.970 --> 01:19:15.550
Get a hold of this study.

01:19:15.550 --> 01:19:17.060
Somebody is coming
up through what

01:19:17.060 --> 01:19:18.940
they believe is some
sort of psych testing

01:19:18.940 --> 01:19:20.510
that they have volunteered for.

01:19:20.510 --> 01:19:22.670
They get in the
elevator to go up.

01:19:22.670 --> 01:19:25.560
And the actual experiment
has started in the elevator.

01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:27.689
Somebody working on the
experiment comes in.

01:19:27.689 --> 01:19:29.480
And they're holding a
whole bunch of books,

01:19:29.480 --> 01:19:30.710
and barely holding on to them.

01:19:30.710 --> 01:19:32.270
And they're having
a cup of something.

01:19:32.270 --> 01:19:34.200
And they ask the person,
can you do me a favor?

01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:35.158
I'm about to drop this.

01:19:35.158 --> 01:19:37.070
Could you just hold
this cup until we get up

01:19:37.070 --> 01:19:38.310
to the fourth floor?

01:19:38.310 --> 01:19:41.100
In one case, the
cup is iced tea.

01:19:41.100 --> 01:19:42.750
The cup is cold.

01:19:42.750 --> 01:19:46.740
In the other case, the
cup is warm tea, warm.

01:19:46.740 --> 01:19:48.720
So the person spends
about 15 seconds

01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:51.489
holding either this cold
cup or this hot cup.

01:19:51.489 --> 01:19:53.030
And the person thanks
them afterward.

01:19:53.030 --> 01:19:54.200
And out they go.

01:19:54.200 --> 01:19:56.090
And then they are
asked to evaluate

01:19:56.090 --> 01:19:58.440
the personality of the
person they just interacted

01:19:58.440 --> 01:19:59.560
with in the elevator.

01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:02.430
And hold the warm cup,
and you rate the person

01:20:02.430 --> 01:20:07.220
as having a warmer, more
expressive personality.

01:20:07.220 --> 01:20:09.920
No, no, no, temperature
we're talking about,

01:20:09.920 --> 01:20:12.180
like how fast molecules
are oscillating.

01:20:12.180 --> 01:20:13.830
That's what temperature is.

01:20:13.830 --> 01:20:15.870
Warmth, that's just a metaphor.

01:20:15.870 --> 01:20:17.230
They get intermixed.

01:20:17.230 --> 01:20:19.690
When brains had to invent
dealing with things

01:20:19.690 --> 01:20:23.130
like how warm of a
personality somebody has,

01:20:23.130 --> 01:20:25.330
or even something
as nutty as how warm

01:20:25.330 --> 01:20:27.840
is the color of the
carpeting in this room,

01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:29.540
where are you going to stuff it?

01:20:29.540 --> 01:20:31.930
In some way, it
is hijacking some

01:20:31.930 --> 01:20:34.980
of the far more literal
pathways of storage

01:20:34.980 --> 01:20:36.770
of information in the brain.

01:20:36.770 --> 01:20:39.530
Another example-- here
is a wonderful one.

01:20:39.530 --> 01:20:42.530
We already know that the same
part of the brain, the anterior

01:20:42.530 --> 01:20:45.000
cingulate that will tell
you that your finger was

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:48.390
just poked, is telling you
that somebody else's finger was

01:20:48.390 --> 01:20:48.890
poked.

01:20:48.890 --> 01:20:52.570
You are feeling their pain in
the same part of the brain that

01:20:52.570 --> 01:20:54.990
is doing pain in the
literal sort of way,

01:20:54.990 --> 01:20:58.140
another case of the brain
kind of mixing metaphor

01:20:58.140 --> 01:21:00.120
and symbol with the real thing.

01:21:00.120 --> 01:21:02.850
Here's a particularly
interesting version.

01:21:02.850 --> 01:21:06.620
Go get yourself exposed
to some totally rotting,

01:21:06.620 --> 01:21:09.700
smelly carcass, or
inadvertently take a bite

01:21:09.700 --> 01:21:12.300
into some truly rotten food.

01:21:12.300 --> 01:21:14.890
And you will have an area
of the brain activate called

01:21:14.890 --> 01:21:17.310
the insular cortex.

01:21:17.310 --> 01:21:19.560
And what that does in
every species looked at

01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:24.770
is it processes foul,
disgusting stimuli-- disgusting

01:21:24.770 --> 01:21:27.580
spoiled food, or rotten,
smell all of that.

01:21:27.580 --> 01:21:29.970
That's what the
insular cortex does.

01:21:29.970 --> 01:21:34.190
And, no doubt, there's
tongue receptors telling you

01:21:34.190 --> 01:21:37.220
bacterial loads, or acidity
of this rotten food,

01:21:37.220 --> 01:21:38.420
or some such thing.

01:21:38.420 --> 01:21:40.860
And that's what this
part of the brain does.

01:21:40.860 --> 01:21:42.930
Now, sit down a person.

01:21:42.930 --> 01:21:46.490
And tell them a story of
somebody being totally, totally

01:21:46.490 --> 01:21:51.040
mistreated by somebody powerful,
and some completely exploited

01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:52.480
of horrible circumstance.

01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:55.960
And the insular
cortex will activate.

01:21:55.960 --> 01:21:58.640
Have somebody play some
game with somebody else,

01:21:58.640 --> 01:22:00.560
one of the prisoner's
dilemma type games,

01:22:00.560 --> 01:22:02.851
where the person
totally stabs him

01:22:02.851 --> 01:22:04.850
in the back, the person
they're playing against.

01:22:04.850 --> 01:22:08.280
And gets away with it, and
make a really exploitative,

01:22:08.280 --> 01:22:09.400
rotten gesture.

01:22:09.400 --> 01:22:12.580
And the insular
cortex activates.

01:22:12.580 --> 01:22:15.780
Sit somebody down and
say in the control group,

01:22:15.780 --> 01:22:17.370
tell me about some
event that happened

01:22:17.370 --> 01:22:18.520
when you were growing up.

01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:21.570
Versus the experimental
group, tell me about a time

01:22:21.570 --> 01:22:24.690
when you were growing up that
you did something really awful

01:22:24.690 --> 01:22:26.050
to somebody else.

01:22:26.050 --> 01:22:28.190
And the person describes
that circumstance.

01:22:28.190 --> 01:22:31.160
And the insular
cortex activates.

01:22:31.160 --> 01:22:33.680
What does this part
of the brain do?

01:22:33.680 --> 01:22:36.390
It's saying, oh, yes, this
food is full of maggots

01:22:36.390 --> 01:22:37.940
and does not taste very well.

01:22:37.940 --> 01:22:41.240
But it also does moral disgust.

01:22:41.240 --> 01:22:44.490
When you are feeling
disgusted with how someone

01:22:44.490 --> 01:22:48.190
has been treated, when how you
have been treated it activates.

01:22:48.190 --> 01:22:51.460
When you are having
moral self-disgust

01:22:51.460 --> 01:22:54.000
recounting something
awful you did to somebody,

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:55.870
this part of the
brain activates.

01:22:55.870 --> 01:22:59.270
My God, don't they realize
up there this is a metaphor?

01:22:59.270 --> 01:23:01.230
You're not really
eating rotten food.

01:23:01.230 --> 01:23:05.080
And every language on
Earth has words referring

01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:07.850
to moral failures
with words denoting

01:23:07.850 --> 01:23:10.780
gustatory, repellent stimuli.

01:23:10.780 --> 01:23:13.200
I am disgusted by what you did.

01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:15.440
The fact that they did
this, when I hear about what

01:23:15.440 --> 01:23:17.200
they did, it makes me nauseous.

01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:19.460
Something about
this smells rotten.

01:23:19.460 --> 01:23:22.430
Every culture has
terms that intermixes

01:23:22.430 --> 01:23:25.880
literal sensory disgust
with moral disgust.

01:23:25.880 --> 01:23:28.810
And what that's telling you
is that when humans came up

01:23:28.810 --> 01:23:31.490
with something as fancy
as moral transgressions,

01:23:31.490 --> 01:23:33.550
where are you going to
stick the sense of outrage

01:23:33.550 --> 01:23:35.425
you feel when there is
a moral transgression?

01:23:35.425 --> 01:23:36.930
I know.

01:23:36.930 --> 01:23:38.730
Let's hijack the part
of the brain that

01:23:38.730 --> 01:23:41.110
tells you you're eating
some rotten food,

01:23:41.110 --> 01:23:43.410
shoehorning into there.

01:23:43.410 --> 01:23:46.430
Now what you see is
it is possible for us

01:23:46.430 --> 01:23:50.090
to begin to confuse on which
level those areas are working.

01:23:50.090 --> 01:23:52.500
Another study, amazing
one a couple of years

01:23:52.500 --> 01:23:54.420
ago-- here's what was
done in the study.

01:23:54.420 --> 01:23:56.030
You take people.

01:23:56.030 --> 01:23:58.030
And you put them
through their paces

01:23:58.030 --> 01:23:59.807
of either telling me
something wonderful

01:23:59.807 --> 01:24:01.390
you did when you
were a kid, something

01:24:01.390 --> 01:24:05.010
neutral, or some moral
transgression you once had.

01:24:05.010 --> 01:24:06.060
Tell me all about it.

01:24:06.060 --> 01:24:08.010
And then afterward,
saying, well,

01:24:08.010 --> 01:24:09.975
thanks for
participating in this.

01:24:09.975 --> 01:24:11.640
And tell you what?

01:24:11.640 --> 01:24:13.240
We can't pay you.

01:24:13.240 --> 01:24:15.930
But we can either
give you this pen set.

01:24:15.930 --> 01:24:18.640
Or we can give you
this nice flash drive.

01:24:18.640 --> 01:24:23.110
Or we can give you this little
soap set of scented soaps,

01:24:23.110 --> 01:24:23.760
or whatever.

01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:27.020
And have people talk about
their moral failings,

01:24:27.020 --> 01:24:30.450
and they're more likely to
choose the soap afterward.

01:24:30.450 --> 01:24:34.340
People want to wash their
hands of their sins.

01:24:34.340 --> 01:24:38.290
And starting with [? pilot ?]
washing his hands of whatever,

01:24:38.290 --> 01:24:42.570
this is in intermixing of
metaphor with reality, showing

01:24:42.570 --> 01:24:44.240
how clearly this was the case.

01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:47.740
Now what they next did in the
study was have people wallow

01:24:47.740 --> 01:24:50.710
in recounting something awful
they had done to somebody else.

01:24:50.710 --> 01:24:53.112
And then they were allowed
to go to the bathroom.

01:24:53.112 --> 01:24:54.570
And I don't quite
remember how they

01:24:54.570 --> 01:24:57.028
did this, if they had cameras
in the bathroom, which I kind

01:24:57.028 --> 01:24:59.980
of suspect they didn't, or if
they weighed the soap afterward

01:24:59.980 --> 01:25:00.550
or something.

01:25:00.550 --> 01:25:03.340
But people who had just gone
through the moral transgression

01:25:03.340 --> 01:25:05.590
recounting were much more
likely to go in the bathroom

01:25:05.590 --> 01:25:07.480
and washed their
hands at that point.

01:25:07.480 --> 01:25:09.310
But now what they
had were people

01:25:09.310 --> 01:25:12.010
who had done the moral
transgression recounting.

01:25:12.010 --> 01:25:14.260
Either they were
given the opportunity

01:25:14.260 --> 01:25:16.910
to wash their hands
afterward of it.

01:25:16.910 --> 01:25:19.920
Or they were not
given the opportunity.

01:25:19.920 --> 01:25:22.780
Now sitting in the
test room, what happens

01:25:22.780 --> 01:25:23.940
is the staged thing.

01:25:23.940 --> 01:25:26.340
One of the people
working on the project

01:25:26.340 --> 01:25:28.550
comes in holding a
whole bunch of books,

01:25:28.550 --> 01:25:30.960
and accidentally drops them.

01:25:30.960 --> 01:25:34.070
And a bunch of pencils
scattered all over the floor.

01:25:34.070 --> 01:25:38.810
If you were allowed to wash your
hands of your metaphorical sins

01:25:38.810 --> 01:25:41.420
in the previous few minutes,
what they showed was

01:25:41.420 --> 01:25:45.750
you were less likely to
jump up and help the person.

01:25:45.750 --> 01:25:48.270
People translating
a sense of being

01:25:48.270 --> 01:25:52.960
morally soiled into being an
imperative of helping somebody

01:25:52.960 --> 01:25:53.550
else.

01:25:53.550 --> 01:25:57.080
Let somebody go wash their hands
of recounting the awful thing

01:25:57.080 --> 01:25:58.820
they did to somebody
else, and they're

01:25:58.820 --> 01:26:01.330
less likely to help
people afterward.

01:26:01.330 --> 01:26:03.280
What I think we're
seeing here is

01:26:03.280 --> 01:26:07.690
this amazing intertwining
of doing some of our most

01:26:07.690 --> 01:26:11.480
abstract judgments, and
decision making, and decisions

01:26:11.480 --> 01:26:14.520
about behaviors or not
where we just got these old,

01:26:14.520 --> 01:26:18.360
ancient, mammalian brains
that those rotten food,

01:26:18.360 --> 01:26:20.150
doesn't do rotten ethics.

01:26:20.150 --> 01:26:22.020
You've got the systems confused.

01:26:22.020 --> 01:26:25.850
What this begins to speak to is
work by very prominent person

01:26:25.850 --> 01:26:28.790
in the field, a guy University
of Virginia Jonathan Haight,

01:26:28.790 --> 01:26:33.360
whose work emphasizes just how
much moral decision making is

01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:37.420
not decision making, how much
it is affective decisions,

01:26:37.420 --> 01:26:41.600
showing first with brain imaging
how often you are getting

01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:46.030
the affective, the limbic,
the disgusted cortical levels

01:26:46.030 --> 01:26:49.310
of response before you
have the decision making.

01:26:49.310 --> 01:26:52.670
Argument being,
there it is affect

01:26:52.670 --> 01:26:55.170
driving the decision making,
rather than the other way

01:26:55.170 --> 01:26:55.850
around.

01:26:55.850 --> 01:26:58.400
But what he also points
out is the frequency

01:26:58.400 --> 01:27:00.270
you give people
scenarios-- and he's

01:27:00.270 --> 01:27:02.320
doing really interesting
work with this-- where

01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:06.190
you give somebody a
scenario where it just

01:27:06.190 --> 01:27:07.580
strikes you as wrong.

01:27:07.580 --> 01:27:10.120
Here are three of
the ones that he

01:27:10.120 --> 01:27:11.720
uses very often in the studies.

01:27:11.720 --> 01:27:15.040
First one, you describe
a pair of siblings.

01:27:15.040 --> 01:27:16.520
They are grown up.

01:27:16.520 --> 01:27:18.539
They are post-reproductive.

01:27:18.539 --> 01:27:19.830
She has gone through menopause.

01:27:19.830 --> 01:27:21.390
He's had a vasectomy, whatever.

01:27:21.390 --> 01:27:25.000
And they are in love, and not
in the platonic sibling way.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:28.260
And they want to have a sexual
incestuous relationship.

01:27:28.260 --> 01:27:31.540
Is it OK for them to do
it completely in private?

01:27:31.540 --> 01:27:34.480
Second scenario-- your
elderly grandmother

01:27:34.480 --> 01:27:37.880
says it is absolutely fine with
her to slap her in the face

01:27:37.880 --> 01:27:38.650
right now.

01:27:38.650 --> 01:27:41.970
Do you feel like it is OK to do?

01:27:41.970 --> 01:27:44.510
Third scenario, one
that he brings up

01:27:44.510 --> 01:27:47.620
having to do with burning
a flag and stomping on it,

01:27:47.620 --> 01:27:50.380
something laden with symbolism,
but at the end of the day

01:27:50.380 --> 01:27:52.800
is nothing more than
just some cloth.

01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:55.330
Another one he brings
up is, you're hungry.

01:27:55.330 --> 01:27:56.840
Your pet has just died.

01:27:56.840 --> 01:27:59.150
Why not cut him up and eat him?

01:27:59.150 --> 01:28:02.900
And in all these cases, what you
have is exactly the responses

01:28:02.900 --> 01:28:04.260
all of you just had in there.

01:28:04.260 --> 01:28:06.350
And these insular,
cortical neurons

01:28:06.350 --> 01:28:08.910
are popping out of people's
ears all over this room.

01:28:08.910 --> 01:28:13.420
And then what he does is say,
well, what's wrong with that?

01:28:13.420 --> 01:28:16.020
And people really
have a hard time

01:28:16.020 --> 01:28:19.770
giving a rational explanation,
this whole framework

01:28:19.770 --> 01:28:22.670
that he has developed, which
most of the imaging research

01:28:22.670 --> 01:28:26.320
agrees with, that people make
their affective decisions long

01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:28.190
before their more
cognitive ones.

01:28:28.190 --> 01:28:31.480
The cognitive ones are catching
up afterward trying to figure

01:28:31.480 --> 01:28:35.400
out, well, why is it so
important that you cannot step

01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:38.090
on some cloth that has
this pattern on it?

01:28:38.090 --> 01:28:40.760
But it's OK to step on
the cloth with-- why

01:28:40.760 --> 01:28:43.900
is that something worth
putting people in jail for?

01:28:43.900 --> 01:28:46.070
It just doesn't feel right.

01:28:46.070 --> 01:28:47.570
And I think what
that has much to do

01:28:47.570 --> 01:28:51.460
with is how much of the
coding of the abstract stuff

01:28:51.460 --> 01:28:54.910
has to be stuffed into ancient
brain pathways that's telling

01:28:54.910 --> 01:28:57.670
you about very cold
things, instead

01:28:57.670 --> 01:29:00.750
of cold personalities,
very disgusting foods

01:29:00.750 --> 01:29:02.760
rather than
disgusting moral acts.

01:29:02.760 --> 01:29:05.880
We are dealing with a very
ancient brain, and one that's

01:29:05.880 --> 01:29:09.460
not very good yet at
separating the limbic world

01:29:09.460 --> 01:29:11.760
from a more cortical one.

01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:14.980
OK, couple more pieces
of this-- final piece

01:29:14.980 --> 01:29:18.840
in terms of making sense of the
neurobiology, which is now you

01:29:18.840 --> 01:29:21.500
look at parts of the
brain when somebody is

01:29:21.500 --> 01:29:22.980
committing an aggressive act.

01:29:22.980 --> 01:29:26.840
And you show neurons
get activated there.

01:29:26.840 --> 01:29:28.230
Well, that's kind
of interesting,

01:29:28.230 --> 01:29:32.740
all sorts of hypothalamus
nuclei, mid-brain, brain stem,

01:29:32.740 --> 01:29:35.910
those reptilian parts of the
brain from the other day.

01:29:35.910 --> 01:29:36.900
You see that happening.

01:29:36.900 --> 01:29:38.941
You say, well, someone
does something aggressive.

01:29:38.941 --> 01:29:40.190
And they activate.

01:29:40.190 --> 01:29:41.580
That seems to be interesting.

01:29:41.580 --> 01:29:42.920
That seems to be pertinent.

01:29:42.920 --> 01:29:45.960
And it winds up being not
pertinent in the slightest,

01:29:45.960 --> 01:29:49.580
because what you see is those
are the same neurons that

01:29:49.580 --> 01:29:52.039
would activate if you are
running for your life.

01:29:52.039 --> 01:29:53.580
Those are the same
neurons that would

01:29:53.580 --> 01:29:56.750
activate if you were running
joyfully to meet someone.

01:29:56.750 --> 01:29:58.330
Those are neurons
that are just doing

01:29:58.330 --> 01:30:01.750
the nuts and bolts sympathetic
nervous system stuff.

01:30:01.750 --> 01:30:03.350
If you were running
for your life,

01:30:03.350 --> 01:30:05.350
or if you were running
towards someone

01:30:05.350 --> 01:30:08.510
you love, and those are totally
different emotional states,

01:30:08.510 --> 01:30:11.070
nonetheless your heart
has to be beating faster.

01:30:11.070 --> 01:30:13.640
And your diaphragm has to be
doing something different.

01:30:13.640 --> 01:30:17.510
These are nonspecific
pathways of activation

01:30:17.510 --> 01:30:19.170
in the sympathetic
nervous system.

01:30:19.170 --> 01:30:22.060
As has been stated, if you are
recording from some of these

01:30:22.060 --> 01:30:24.850
sympathetic nuclei
in the mid-brain,

01:30:24.850 --> 01:30:27.930
if you were recording from them,
you cannot tell the difference

01:30:27.930 --> 01:30:31.320
whether a person has just
murdered someone or just had

01:30:31.320 --> 01:30:32.520
an orgasm.

01:30:32.520 --> 01:30:34.410
In both of those
cases, neurons have

01:30:34.410 --> 01:30:36.420
to be doing very similar things.

01:30:36.420 --> 01:30:40.720
There's a whole realm of
non-specificity to arousal.

01:30:40.720 --> 01:30:43.330
And this brings up a
really important quote,

01:30:43.330 --> 01:30:46.290
and one that I think will run
through all of these aggression

01:30:46.290 --> 01:30:50.470
sections here, a quote
from Elie Wiesel,

01:30:50.470 --> 01:30:53.580
concentration camp survivor,
Nobel Laureate for his writing,

01:30:53.580 --> 01:30:55.930
Elie Wiesel,
extraordinary man, who

01:30:55.930 --> 01:30:59.150
has this famous quote,
which goes as follows.

01:30:59.150 --> 01:31:02.440
The opposite of
love is not hate.

01:31:02.440 --> 01:31:05.950
The opposite of love
is indifference.

01:31:05.950 --> 01:31:07.820
And the way that he
uses it is in sort

01:31:07.820 --> 01:31:09.426
of a historical framework.

01:31:09.426 --> 01:31:10.800
The opposite of
love is not hate.

01:31:10.800 --> 01:31:12.830
The greatest harm
you can do to someone

01:31:12.830 --> 01:31:14.450
who has been a
victim of something

01:31:14.450 --> 01:31:17.230
is to be indifferent
to their history,

01:31:17.230 --> 01:31:20.596
to deny that it has happened,
to see it not be an imperative

01:31:20.596 --> 01:31:22.720
to make sure it never
happens to anyone else again,

01:31:22.720 --> 01:31:23.880
et cetera, et cetera.

01:31:23.880 --> 01:31:26.470
The opposite of hate
is indifference.

01:31:26.470 --> 01:31:29.770
Applied to physiology here,
it is absolutely the case.

01:31:29.770 --> 01:31:32.240
When you look at what the
sympathetic nervous system is

01:31:32.240 --> 01:31:35.290
doing, when you look at
some of the stress hormones,

01:31:35.290 --> 01:31:37.750
love and hate are not
opposites in the slightest.

01:31:37.750 --> 01:31:40.330
They are physiologically
very, very similar.

01:31:40.330 --> 01:31:42.390
What I think that
also tells you is

01:31:42.390 --> 01:31:45.580
how readily some humans
psychopathologically

01:31:45.580 --> 01:31:47.380
can confuse the two states.

01:31:47.380 --> 01:31:48.960
When you look at
some of these brain

01:31:48.960 --> 01:31:52.160
stem hindbrain spinal
areas during these acts,

01:31:52.160 --> 01:31:53.820
love and hate are not opposites.

01:31:53.820 --> 01:31:56.270
They are very related
to each other.

01:31:56.270 --> 01:32:00.270
OK, jumping forward in the last
couple of minutes, what we now

01:32:00.270 --> 01:32:03.040
have is looking at
what hormones are doing

01:32:03.040 --> 01:32:05.830
to this-- hormones in terms
of the short-term hormonal

01:32:05.830 --> 01:32:09.000
environment, not early in
life, the short-term hormonal

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:09.700
environment.

01:32:09.700 --> 01:32:12.130
And what we have to deal
with, of course, instantly

01:32:12.130 --> 01:32:13.930
if we're going to
bring up hormones is,

01:32:13.930 --> 01:32:16.370
so what's the deal
with testosterone?

01:32:16.370 --> 01:32:19.340
What does testosterone
have to do with aggression?

01:32:19.340 --> 01:32:22.480
Why is it that in virtually
every species out there,

01:32:22.480 --> 01:32:25.490
males are more aggressive
than females, males have more

01:32:25.490 --> 01:32:27.140
testosterone than females do?

01:32:27.140 --> 01:32:29.720
All you need to do to make
sense of this whole section

01:32:29.720 --> 01:32:32.410
here is take everything
from last week concerning

01:32:32.410 --> 01:32:34.890
testosterone and sexual
behavior and just

01:32:34.890 --> 01:32:38.150
substitute aggressive
behavior for sexual behavior.

01:32:38.150 --> 01:32:39.980
It's the same exact rules.

01:32:39.980 --> 01:32:43.560
Yes, testosterone is required
for the full expression

01:32:43.560 --> 01:32:46.430
of aggressive behavior
in males of most species.

01:32:46.430 --> 01:32:47.470
How do you tell?

01:32:47.470 --> 01:32:50.160
Subtract it out, the
castration stuff.

01:32:50.160 --> 01:32:53.690
After castration, do levels
of aggression go down to zero?

01:32:53.690 --> 01:32:57.620
No, same thing as last
week, the more prior

01:32:57.620 --> 01:33:00.520
experience one has
being aggressive,

01:33:00.520 --> 01:33:02.260
the less of a drop
in aggression there

01:33:02.260 --> 01:33:05.290
is after testosterone
levels are removed.

01:33:05.290 --> 01:33:09.600
Put back 100% the normal levels,
aggression is reinstated.

01:33:09.600 --> 01:33:13.710
Put back 10% the normal levels,
reinstated to the same extent,

01:33:13.710 --> 01:33:18.070
200%, same extent, same
exact rule-- testosterone

01:33:18.070 --> 01:33:21.140
is needed for the normal
expression of behavior.

01:33:21.140 --> 01:33:24.490
But it is not necessary
or sufficient.

01:33:24.490 --> 01:33:26.600
And your brain,
your limbic system,

01:33:26.600 --> 01:33:28.730
can't tell the
difference between

01:33:28.730 --> 01:33:32.290
moderate, medium, and very
high levels of testosterone.

01:33:32.290 --> 01:33:34.840
There is no way you could
look at an individual's

01:33:34.840 --> 01:33:36.820
testosterone levels,
and because it's

01:33:36.820 --> 01:33:39.220
two units higher than
it was last week,

01:33:39.220 --> 01:33:41.640
or higher than the person
sitting next to them, to make

01:33:41.640 --> 01:33:45.260
any sort of prediction about who
is going to be more aggressive.

01:33:45.260 --> 01:33:47.990
When you see a correlation
between the levels

01:33:47.990 --> 01:33:50.660
of aggression and
levels of testosterone,

01:33:50.660 --> 01:33:54.400
it's the behavior driving the
testosterone, not the other way

01:33:54.400 --> 01:33:55.680
around.

01:33:55.680 --> 01:33:57.870
How does this translate
into physiology?

01:33:57.870 --> 01:34:01.190
Here's one example of
this in terms of studies.

01:34:01.190 --> 01:34:03.520
Take five rhesus monkey
males-- and this was

01:34:03.520 --> 01:34:05.120
a classic study that was done.

01:34:05.120 --> 01:34:07.780
Put them together, and they
form a dominance hierarchy.

01:34:07.780 --> 01:34:09.630
Number run beats
two through five,

01:34:09.630 --> 01:34:11.800
number two beats three
through five, so on.

01:34:11.800 --> 01:34:15.220
Take number three and pump
him up with testosterone.

01:34:15.220 --> 01:34:18.240
Pump him up with insane
amounts of testosterone.

01:34:18.240 --> 01:34:22.800
And what you will see is he will
now be involved in more fights.

01:34:22.800 --> 01:34:25.600
Does that mean that number
three is now threatening

01:34:25.600 --> 01:34:27.420
number two and number one?

01:34:27.420 --> 01:34:30.570
Absolutely not, what's
going on, number three

01:34:30.570 --> 01:34:34.280
is being a nightmare to
numbers four and five.

01:34:34.280 --> 01:34:37.270
Is testosterone
changing the structure

01:34:37.270 --> 01:34:38.780
of aggression in this group?

01:34:38.780 --> 01:34:43.670
No, it's exaggerating the
pre-existing social structure.

01:34:43.670 --> 01:34:46.360
What testosterone
does is modulate.

01:34:46.360 --> 01:34:47.660
It amplifies.

01:34:47.660 --> 01:34:51.510
It does not turn on a
radio of aggressive music.

01:34:51.510 --> 01:34:53.860
It increases the
volume if and only

01:34:53.860 --> 01:34:56.020
if it is already turned on.

01:34:56.020 --> 01:34:59.510
What does this look like
in terms of the biology,

01:34:59.510 --> 01:35:01.510
getting down to the
neurobiology level?

01:35:01.510 --> 01:35:04.620
That whole business,
raise testosterone levels,

01:35:04.620 --> 01:35:07.330
and the amygdala gets
a lower threshold

01:35:07.330 --> 01:35:09.840
for deciding that a
face looks threatening.

01:35:09.840 --> 01:35:12.520
Put somebody in a brain
scanner, and flashing up

01:35:12.520 --> 01:35:16.580
subliminal faces, and it takes
less of a scary face, one that

01:35:16.580 --> 01:35:19.790
would be border line higher
testosterone levels in someone,

01:35:19.790 --> 01:35:22.760
amygdala activates more.

01:35:22.760 --> 01:35:25.190
How would this look like
on a cellular level?

01:35:25.190 --> 01:35:26.720
Back, remember,
with that business

01:35:26.720 --> 01:35:29.880
about action potentials, the
neuron has an action potential.

01:35:29.880 --> 01:35:34.810
And then for a while afterward,
it enters a refractory period.

01:35:34.810 --> 01:35:37.170
It is silent for
a while afterward.

01:35:37.170 --> 01:35:40.450
What does testosterone do on
the level of single neurons

01:35:40.450 --> 01:35:41.610
in the amygdala?

01:35:41.610 --> 01:35:44.850
It shortens the
refractory period.

01:35:44.850 --> 01:35:46.840
It makes it possible
for the neurons

01:35:46.840 --> 01:35:50.000
to fire more times
per unit time,

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:51.840
thus asking the
question, what does

01:35:51.840 --> 01:35:55.170
testosterone do to
electrical activity

01:35:55.170 --> 01:35:56.710
in neurons and the amygdala?

01:35:56.710 --> 01:35:58.340
It does nothing.

01:35:58.340 --> 01:36:02.600
If and only if the neurons
are already excited,

01:36:02.600 --> 01:36:05.240
testosterone will increase
the numbers of them.

01:36:05.240 --> 01:36:07.370
Testosterone does not cause.

01:36:07.370 --> 01:36:08.600
It amplifies.

01:36:08.600 --> 01:36:13.880
And what it mostly amplifies is
preexisting social structures.

01:36:13.880 --> 01:36:16.000
OK, you noticed
there that I was also

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.617
being very careful in
saying on the average,

01:36:18.617 --> 01:36:21.200
males are more aggressive than
females in all sorts of species

01:36:21.200 --> 01:36:21.700
out there.

01:36:21.700 --> 01:36:24.480
On the average, males have
higher testosterone levels

01:36:24.480 --> 01:36:25.420
than females do.

01:36:25.420 --> 01:36:28.170
The one great exception
to this, which is briefly

01:36:28.170 --> 01:36:29.780
touched on in the
zebra book, which

01:36:29.780 --> 01:36:33.050
is one of the great topics
in all of endocrinology

01:36:33.050 --> 01:36:36.030
these days, is spotted hyenas.

01:36:36.030 --> 01:36:38.460
Hyenas are weird animals.

01:36:38.460 --> 01:36:42.000
Hyenas have a totally
different worldview thanks

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.020
to a bizarre neurobiology.

01:36:44.020 --> 01:36:48.670
Among spotted hyenas, females
are dominant to males.

01:36:48.670 --> 01:36:50.970
Females are bigger than males.

01:36:50.970 --> 01:36:53.590
Females are more
muscular than males.

01:36:53.590 --> 01:36:56.070
Females are more
aggressive than males.

01:36:56.070 --> 01:36:59.580
Females have higher testosterone
levels than males do.

01:36:59.580 --> 01:37:02.020
And you look at the
private parts of a hyena,

01:37:02.020 --> 01:37:04.490
and you cannot tell
who is which sex.

01:37:04.490 --> 01:37:08.050
Female hyenas have
androgenization.

01:37:08.050 --> 01:37:11.890
They have enlarged clitoris's
the size of penises in males.

01:37:11.890 --> 01:37:14.760
They have something that looks
like a scrotum, which turns out

01:37:14.760 --> 01:37:18.980
to be compacted fat cells that
form these scrotum-like things.

01:37:18.980 --> 01:37:21.310
And they look just
like the males.

01:37:21.310 --> 01:37:23.180
And over the years as
part of my field work,

01:37:23.180 --> 01:37:26.090
I spent some years sharing
camp with a guy who is without

01:37:26.090 --> 01:37:29.350
question the world's expert
on, like, hyena clitoris's.

01:37:29.350 --> 01:37:32.390
And this guy would bring
in some anesthetized hyena.

01:37:32.390 --> 01:37:34.780
And he would have to
look at this thing for 15

01:37:34.780 --> 01:37:37.785
minutes with like
calipers, and like night

01:37:37.785 --> 01:37:40.860
viewing goggles and stuff to
finally decide its gender.

01:37:40.860 --> 01:37:45.240
Hyenas are this very interesting
case of a sex reversal

01:37:45.240 --> 01:37:46.810
androgenization.

01:37:46.810 --> 01:37:48.880
Females producing
very high levels

01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:50.810
of androgens in their ovaries.

01:37:50.810 --> 01:37:53.070
And you've got this
sex reversal system

01:37:53.070 --> 01:37:57.040
with the following thing, unlike
in most species of carnivores.

01:37:57.040 --> 01:37:59.370
What happens in the
lions, for example,

01:37:59.370 --> 01:38:03.570
males eat first, followed by
females, followed by cubs.

01:38:03.570 --> 01:38:07.080
Most lion cubs starve to death
in the first year of life.

01:38:07.080 --> 01:38:10.610
Among hyenas because of
the sex reversal system,

01:38:10.610 --> 01:38:14.470
cubs eat first, followed by
females, followed by males.

01:38:14.470 --> 01:38:18.890
The kids survive that
way, a wonderful mutation

01:38:18.890 --> 01:38:20.040
in terms of doing that.

01:38:20.040 --> 01:38:22.910
And what you get as a
result is, unavoidably, you

01:38:22.910 --> 01:38:26.840
get a masculinization of the
genitalia in the females.

01:38:26.840 --> 01:38:29.840
And what you wind up doing
is it winds up having

01:38:29.840 --> 01:38:32.410
a different signaling purpose.

01:38:32.410 --> 01:38:35.260
In most species, what
happens among male primates,

01:38:35.260 --> 01:38:37.820
for example when
males are trying

01:38:37.820 --> 01:38:40.660
to display their dominance,
they get an erection

01:38:40.660 --> 01:38:44.090
and wave their penis, and
look how tough and scary I am.

01:38:44.090 --> 01:38:46.290
And that's due to
a certain wiring

01:38:46.290 --> 01:38:48.020
of the autonomic nervous system.

01:38:48.020 --> 01:38:51.380
In hyenas, it works
just the opposite.

01:38:51.380 --> 01:38:54.476
Males get erections
when they're terrified,

01:38:54.476 --> 01:38:55.600
because you think about it.

01:38:55.600 --> 01:38:57.150
Males are lower
ranking than females.

01:38:57.150 --> 01:38:59.530
Females spend all their
time ripping off the males

01:38:59.530 --> 01:39:00.890
who have just hunted something.

01:39:00.890 --> 01:39:02.650
Females terrorize the males.

01:39:02.650 --> 01:39:04.160
So you're some
male sitting there.

01:39:04.160 --> 01:39:06.320
And here comes this
terrifying female.

01:39:06.320 --> 01:39:06.990
What do you do?

01:39:06.990 --> 01:39:08.470
You say, don't hurt me.

01:39:08.470 --> 01:39:09.540
I'm one of these males.

01:39:09.540 --> 01:39:11.110
I'm not threatening,
or whatever.

01:39:11.110 --> 01:39:14.260
In males, what you get
is you get erections

01:39:14.260 --> 01:39:17.330
when you are under stress
as a subordination gesture.

01:39:17.330 --> 01:39:18.870
What do females do?

01:39:18.870 --> 01:39:22.010
Low ranking females
get clitoral erections

01:39:22.010 --> 01:39:24.520
when they are being threatened
by high ranking females,

01:39:24.520 --> 01:39:26.890
a total sex reversal system.

01:39:26.890 --> 01:39:29.920
So hyenas can either
wind up telling you,

01:39:29.920 --> 01:39:33.530
we are breaking out of
these stereotypical role

01:39:33.530 --> 01:39:35.980
gender expectations, in that
you can have a species where

01:39:35.980 --> 01:39:38.995
females are dominant, and more
muscular, and more aggressive.

01:39:38.995 --> 01:39:40.870
But at the end of the
day, they are like that

01:39:40.870 --> 01:39:43.440
because they are even
more hormonally like males

01:39:43.440 --> 01:39:45.270
than males are.

01:39:45.270 --> 01:39:47.580
Final amazing thing
about them-- and this

01:39:47.580 --> 01:39:49.600
is a story of this
friend of mine,

01:39:49.600 --> 01:39:52.366
this guy who's been studying
hyenas for 30 years.

01:39:52.366 --> 01:39:55.780
And he's incredibly
knowledgeable about hyenas.

01:39:55.780 --> 01:39:57.560
And this was
something that really

01:39:57.560 --> 01:39:59.960
makes you stunned at
what sort of people

01:39:59.960 --> 01:40:02.490
there are in the government
thinking about things here.

01:40:02.490 --> 01:40:04.110
So one day-- he's from Berkeley.

01:40:04.110 --> 01:40:05.750
One day, he's in
his office there.

01:40:05.750 --> 01:40:06.920
And he gets a call.

01:40:06.920 --> 01:40:09.650
And it's from some army colonel.

01:40:09.650 --> 01:40:12.869
And the army colonel says,
oh, we're having a conference.

01:40:12.869 --> 01:40:15.410
And we're having a whole bunch
of carnivore biologists coming

01:40:15.410 --> 01:40:15.576
to it.

01:40:15.576 --> 01:40:16.690
We're going to
have a great time.

01:40:16.690 --> 01:40:18.990
We're having this conference
of carnivore biologists.

01:40:18.990 --> 01:40:20.240
And we want you to come to it.

01:40:20.240 --> 01:40:23.155
My friend says, um,
you're from the army?

01:40:23.155 --> 01:40:24.280
What are you talking about?

01:40:24.280 --> 01:40:25.380
Do you know what I study?

01:40:25.380 --> 01:40:27.963
And the guy proceeds to show him
that he knows exactly what he

01:40:27.963 --> 01:40:30.140
studies, and what his
social security number is,

01:40:30.140 --> 01:40:33.390
and how many, like, cavities he
has, and how much unpaid taxes.

01:40:33.390 --> 01:40:35.906
And he says, so all of
America's carnivore biologists

01:40:35.906 --> 01:40:37.030
are coming to this meeting.

01:40:37.030 --> 01:40:37.890
So come to this meeting.

01:40:37.890 --> 01:40:39.070
We're going to
have a great time.

01:40:39.070 --> 01:40:40.850
It's going to be at
this hotel in Arizona.

01:40:40.850 --> 01:40:42.620
Come, you're going to
have a terrific guy.

01:40:42.620 --> 01:40:44.180
So my friend decides, why not?

01:40:44.180 --> 01:40:46.370
And goes to this, and
winds up in this place.

01:40:46.370 --> 01:40:48.010
And here's this
conference with all

01:40:48.010 --> 01:40:49.910
of America's
carnivore biologists,

01:40:49.910 --> 01:40:51.740
and these three army
colonels sitting

01:40:51.740 --> 01:40:53.850
in the back with
these sunglasses on.

01:40:53.850 --> 01:40:56.720
So all the carnivore biologists
are fairly confused about

01:40:56.720 --> 01:40:57.959
what's up here.

01:40:57.959 --> 01:40:59.750
But, nonetheless, they
sort of settle down.

01:40:59.750 --> 01:41:01.541
And they start doing
their scientist thing,

01:41:01.541 --> 01:41:03.240
giving talks to each other.

01:41:03.240 --> 01:41:06.400
And the Army guys are
sitting in the back there.

01:41:06.400 --> 01:41:08.590
And there's two days
worth of them just sitting

01:41:08.590 --> 01:41:09.730
in the back saying nothing.

01:41:09.730 --> 01:41:11.710
And, finally, all the
carnival biologists

01:41:11.710 --> 01:41:14.416
get all upset, and say, what
are you guys doing here?

01:41:14.416 --> 01:41:15.790
What are we doing
at a conference

01:41:15.790 --> 01:41:17.690
paid for by the US Military?

01:41:17.690 --> 01:41:19.987
And they finally say, OK,
OK, you're such great guys.

01:41:19.987 --> 01:41:22.570
We're going to tell you actually
what we're really up to here.

01:41:22.570 --> 01:41:23.986
You know, we're
from the military.

01:41:23.986 --> 01:41:25.850
We're actually from
the tank corps.

01:41:25.850 --> 01:41:30.130
And what we have is we're
designing these new walker

01:41:30.130 --> 01:41:30.630
things.

01:41:30.630 --> 01:41:33.252
Do you remember in the Star
Wars movie, in the second one,

01:41:33.252 --> 01:41:35.710
they had those machines that
looked like the elephants that

01:41:35.710 --> 01:41:36.834
could walk and all of that?

01:41:36.834 --> 01:41:38.400
Well, we want to build them.

01:41:38.400 --> 01:41:40.180
In order to build
them, we have to know

01:41:40.180 --> 01:41:44.020
how animals locomote, locomate,
how they move, how they walk.

01:41:44.020 --> 01:41:45.560
And you guys study carnivores.

01:41:45.560 --> 01:41:46.960
And carnivores run around a lot.

01:41:46.960 --> 01:41:48.460
So we want to hear you guys.

01:41:48.460 --> 01:41:50.430
Tell us how your animals
move when they're

01:41:50.430 --> 01:41:52.400
doing things like hunting.

01:41:52.400 --> 01:41:55.160
And America's carnivore
biologists listen to this,

01:41:55.160 --> 01:41:57.100
and say, this makes
no sense at all.

01:41:57.100 --> 01:41:59.030
You want to learn about
locomotion in animals.

01:41:59.030 --> 01:42:01.690
You get bioengineering people.

01:42:01.690 --> 01:42:03.370
You don't get zoologists.

01:42:03.370 --> 01:42:04.400
What's going on here?

01:42:04.400 --> 01:42:06.430
So all of America's
carnivore biologists

01:42:06.430 --> 01:42:09.250
proceed to go and sort of
huddle there, and decide

01:42:09.250 --> 01:42:10.250
they're going on strike.

01:42:10.250 --> 01:42:11.958
They are not going to
give any more talks

01:42:11.958 --> 01:42:13.660
until people explain what's up.

01:42:13.660 --> 01:42:16.380
They eat all the donuts that
are left, go to the bar,

01:42:16.380 --> 01:42:17.005
start drinking.

01:42:17.005 --> 01:42:18.838
And they're going to
refuse to have anything

01:42:18.838 --> 01:42:20.360
to do until these
colonels explain

01:42:20.360 --> 01:42:21.850
what's actually going on.

01:42:21.850 --> 01:42:24.430
So the colonels, obviously,
need to get on the phone

01:42:24.430 --> 01:42:27.030
to Washington, and call
up, and get permission.

01:42:27.030 --> 01:42:29.887
They come back and say, OK,
OK, because you guys are all

01:42:29.887 --> 01:42:32.470
our best friends, we're going
to tell you what's really going.

01:42:32.470 --> 01:42:34.589
We're really not making
Star Wars walkers.

01:42:34.589 --> 01:42:35.880
Here's what we're really doing.

01:42:35.880 --> 01:42:38.140
We're from the tank corps.

01:42:38.140 --> 01:42:40.310
And we've built this
new tank recently

01:42:40.310 --> 01:42:42.280
and it was what was
called the Sherman tank.

01:42:42.280 --> 01:42:43.789
And apparently for
all of history,

01:42:43.789 --> 01:42:46.080
what you do if you're in the
tank corps, is what you do

01:42:46.080 --> 01:42:48.300
is you just bash the
hell out of everything,

01:42:48.300 --> 01:42:50.210
and drive your tank
to the highest spot

01:42:50.210 --> 01:42:52.350
around, and just shoot
anything that moves.

01:42:52.350 --> 01:42:55.529
But the Sherman tank apparently
was like the greatest tank

01:42:55.529 --> 01:42:56.570
that had ever been built.

01:42:56.570 --> 01:42:59.150
It could drive like
60 miles an hour.

01:42:59.150 --> 01:43:02.540
And it could fire missiles when
it was bouncing upside down

01:43:02.540 --> 01:43:05.770
out of ditches, and
gyroscopic this and that.

01:43:05.770 --> 01:43:07.910
And it was the greatest,
most mobile tank.

01:43:07.910 --> 01:43:09.570
And they were having
a problem, which

01:43:09.570 --> 01:43:11.680
was they would put in
their tank corps in there.

01:43:11.680 --> 01:43:13.720
And what they would do was bash
the hell out of everything,

01:43:13.720 --> 01:43:15.886
and drive to the highest
spot around, and just shoot

01:43:15.886 --> 01:43:16.850
anything that moved.

01:43:16.850 --> 01:43:19.960
So the US Army Corps
decided that they

01:43:19.960 --> 01:43:23.300
needed to teach their troops,
their army, their tank corps,

01:43:23.300 --> 01:43:25.670
how to hunt like carnivores.

01:43:25.670 --> 01:43:28.500
And, thus, here they
invited all of America's

01:43:28.500 --> 01:43:31.590
carnivore biologists
to come in and teach us

01:43:31.590 --> 01:43:35.040
how to teach our tank crews
how to hunt like carnivores.

01:43:35.040 --> 01:43:36.520
How do you figure
out who's going

01:43:36.520 --> 01:43:38.317
to cut corners on the prey?

01:43:38.317 --> 01:43:40.900
How do you communicate if you're
out of sight with each other?

01:43:40.900 --> 01:43:42.350
What do your hyenas do?

01:43:42.350 --> 01:43:43.680
What do your wolves do?

01:43:43.680 --> 01:43:45.180
What do your coyotes do?

01:43:45.180 --> 01:43:48.280
So at that point, like, all of
America's carnivore biologists

01:43:48.280 --> 01:43:52.140
say, whoa, we are way
in over our heads here.

01:43:52.140 --> 01:43:55.570
So a third of them
instantly march out

01:43:55.570 --> 01:43:58.320
shouting about Ho Chi
Minh or whatever, given

01:43:58.320 --> 01:44:00.924
the age group of most of
America's carnivore biologists.

01:44:00.924 --> 01:44:02.340
And the rest of
them huddle there.

01:44:02.340 --> 01:44:03.050
And they come back.

01:44:03.050 --> 01:44:04.510
And they say, well,
these are very

01:44:04.510 --> 01:44:06.384
difficult questions to answer.

01:44:06.384 --> 01:44:08.550
So the military guys say,
well, yes we will give you

01:44:08.550 --> 01:44:09.880
money for your research.

01:44:09.880 --> 01:44:12.420
So at that point, all of
America's carnivore biologists

01:44:12.420 --> 01:44:15.000
decide they're now best friends
with these Army Corps guys.

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:16.760
They go through the rest of
the conference telling them

01:44:16.760 --> 01:44:18.880
all about the hunting
techniques of their animals,

01:44:18.880 --> 01:44:21.540
and with careful instructions
as to who to submit grants to.

01:44:21.540 --> 01:44:24.540
They all immediately go back to
the universities, write grants.

01:44:24.540 --> 01:44:28.320
My friend writes this grant
for like four Sherman tanks,

01:44:28.320 --> 01:44:31.860
and night viewing goggles
for like a Death Star

01:44:31.860 --> 01:44:34.480
and flamethrowers for his
hyenas, and all of that.

01:44:34.480 --> 01:44:36.600
All of America's
carnivore biologists

01:44:36.600 --> 01:44:39.830
send in their grant proposals
to this PO Box at the Pentagon.

01:44:39.830 --> 01:44:43.760
And nobody has ever heard from
any of these Army guys again.

01:44:43.760 --> 01:44:45.560
And this was about 15 years ago.

01:44:45.560 --> 01:44:47.750
And to this day,
none of them know

01:44:47.750 --> 01:44:50.210
what were these people
really trying to find out

01:44:50.210 --> 01:44:51.510
from us at this meeting?

01:44:51.510 --> 01:44:53.900
This was this totally
bizarre incident

01:44:53.900 --> 01:44:55.945
showing that somebody or
other in the tank corps

01:44:55.945 --> 01:44:57.580
is sitting around
trying to figure out

01:44:57.580 --> 01:45:02.084
what it is that the coyotes,
and marmots, and hyenas do.

01:45:02.084 --> 01:45:05.750
