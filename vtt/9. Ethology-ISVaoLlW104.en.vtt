00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.458
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:05.990
Stanford University.

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:12.600
Let's get started.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:18.830
Let's see.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.620
Once again, game plan for
the coming week or so.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:27.230
Next three lectures will be the
TA overviews-- introductions

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.530
to nervous system,
endocrinology.

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:32.770
Once again-- what I
emphasized the other day is--

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.890
if you're not sure if you've
got enough background exposure

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.870
to these topics for
it to be worth coming,

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.160
I would suggest you
assume that you don't.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.910
Because it could do
nothing more than

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.330
help, even if you've had
a lot of this before.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.090
Following that, some more
advanced topics in the subject,

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.830
and then barreling
on into the midterm.

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:52.360
OK.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.180
Today we leap yet
another discipline

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:00.100
into yet another one, this one
being concerned with basically

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.250
the same exact issues that we've
had before-- nature, nurture,

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.890
interaction, behavior.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.220
And this one, as you will see,
with a completely different

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.800
approach than all
the prior ones.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.080
Now the other day, when going
through what heritability means

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.680
and doesn't mean, one of the key
points that came out at the end

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.900
was that whole business of,
the more different environments

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.260
you study something in, the
lower your heritability term

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:28.840
is going to be.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.470
So what's one of the punch
lines that comes out of that?

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.280
If you want to understand
the genetics of behavior,

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.690
you've got to go look
at the behavior in lots

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.340
of different environments.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.430
What today's
discipline is about is

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.160
taking that one step broader.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.110
If you want to
understand anything

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.120
about the biology of
behavior, number one,

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.390
you want to study it in lots
of different environments.

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.860
Number two, you want to study
it in as natural of environments

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:54.830
as possible.

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.790
And number three,
go in there assuming

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.750
that you are going to have
to translate a language.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.000
The quote at the
beginning there,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.810
something to the
effect of ethology,

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.920
the field we'll be
looking at today.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.190
Ethology is the process
of interviewing an animal,

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.270
but in its own language.

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.890
So what we'll see
here is this is

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.140
an expansion, in a certain way,
on that notion that if you want

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.140
to understand behavior, get your
animal out of the laboratory.

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.390
Now to begin to
sort of appreciate

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.360
the context this
has in history, we

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.500
start off-- God help us--
with history of psychology

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.340
at around 1900 or so.

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.500
When, universally agreed upon,
the Grand Poobah of psychology

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.820
was William James.

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.321
And all I know
about William James

00:02:40.321 --> 00:02:41.820
is that he was
highly philosophical,

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.920
and I fall asleep every
time I try to read the guy.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.650
But he dominated the period
in a way in which psychology

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.230
was basically an introspective
business that was

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.300
sort of a branch of philosophy.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.400
And coming out in the
decades after that

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.750
were the Young
Turks of psychology,

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.150
who despised this whole
approach, because they wanted

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.290
to make psychology a science--
a quantitative science,

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:08.990
an experimental science.

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:10.580
They wanted numbers.

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.620
Enough of this philosophy stuff.

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:18.760
And out of it came this very
deep, deep reflexive distrust

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.400
of any behavior you couldn't
see and you couldn't measure.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.750
And you didn't want to know what
was going on inside anybody's

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.980
personal life,
inside their head,

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.240
whether they were
a fish or a human.

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.590
All you were
interested in is what

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.500
was going on in
the outside world

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.670
just before that
behavior occurred

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.520
and what behavior was it.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.820
Simple organisms as
input output black boxes.

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.020
Forget this philosophy stuff.

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.650
Give me something I can measure.

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.510
And this was this
emerging discipline

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.800
of behaviorism, which
became the dominant school

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.870
in American psychology by the
middle of the last century.

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.050
We've already heard from one of
the starting founding fathers

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.010
of it, and that was John Watson.

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.080
That was the guy from the
first lecture-- give me

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.640
a kid from any
background, and I'll

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.810
turn him into a butcher,
baker, candlestick maker

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.750
sort of thing, and
that everything could

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.030
be controlled in environment.

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.660
And thus, you could
shape behavior

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.430
to any direction you want.

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.870
Behaviorism sort of hit its
heyday, its absolute apogee,

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.790
with its most
famous practitioner,

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:24.440
who was BF Skinner.

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.720
Skinner-- who dominated, I
think, most studies show.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.760
Or that he was the
best known, most

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.850
cited psychologist
throughout the middle part

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.010
of the last century.

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.090
Incredibly influential, and
American psychology at the time

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.220
was all about behaviors.

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.000
What are the key features of it?

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.320
First one was this
hysterical, radical, extreme

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:49.880
environmentalism.

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:54.740
The notion that we are all
table rases, whatever that is.

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.370
That we are all blank slates
and all that we come in with

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:02.430
is this blank slate to be
written on by environment.

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:03.930
Don't tell me about genes.

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.030
Don't tell me about
biology at all.

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:07.630
Don't tell me about
anything other

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:09.920
than what's going on
in the environment,

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.350
and how does that shape
the behavior coming out

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:14.590
the other end, and
can I measure it?

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:20.140
Extreme radical environmentalism
in terms of gene environment.

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:21.450
There were no genes.

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:25.100
There were no interactions as
far as they were concerned.

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.770
The next building
principal was this notion

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:30.150
of reinforcement theory.

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:34.220
Let me control when any
given organism receives

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:37.890
a positive
reinforcement, a reward.

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:41.520
Let me control when it receives
a negative reinforcement

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:42.690
of punishment.

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:46.070
Give me the ability to control
those in the environment,

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:50.250
and I will produce any behavior
you want in that organism.

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:53.550
Once again, whether it is a
fish or a human and everything

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:57.510
in between, this utter
reliance on behavior

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:02.650
is shaped by the rewards and
punishments of environment.

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:04.950
Reinforcement theory.

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:09.510
The final piece of it was
this notion of universality.

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:11.860
Which is, it works
this way in everybody!

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:15.120
It works this way in every
single species out there.

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.765
And if you want
to study lab rats,

00:06:16.765 --> 00:06:18.640
you're going to learn
the exact same thing as

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:20.100
if you were studying giraffes.

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:22.500
But it's a lot harder
to study them in a lab.

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:24.330
You sure don't need
to study them out

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:27.990
in their natural habitat,
because it's just understanding

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:31.010
the reinforcements coming
in, the behavior coming out

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:31.930
the other end.

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:34.100
They're all the same.

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:37.100
This period dominated
by the behaviorists

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:39.940
was, historically, a total drag.

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:43.050
Because these guys had just
a stranglehold on the field.

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:45.470
And all of them,
like, looked the same.

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:48.140
If you ever look in one
of those time-life books

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:50.040
on the history of
the mind or whatever,

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.930
there will be the
inevitable picture

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:54.580
of BF Skinner with some pigeon.

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:58.155
And Skinner was
like your archetypal

00:06:58.155 --> 00:07:00.420
out-of-central-casting
behaviors.

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:05.570
He had this inordinately shiny
forehead and these big glasses.

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:07.390
And every picture of
him, for some reason,

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:10.310
photographers were always
forced to kneel down and take

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:12.880
a picture of him looming
over with his pigeon.

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:15.900
And everything considered, this
was an incredibly frightening

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:16.960
looking man.

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:21.050
And he would then be free to
go on with astonishing quotes

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:25.290
like, dog, cat, rat,
child, doesn't matter.

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:26.630
It's all the same.

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:30.350
This notion of universality
of behaviorism.

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:34.600
And Skinner invented all
sorts of Utopian societies--

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:36.910
one, a book of his that
was very influential,

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:39.100
a novel called Walden Two.

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:43.260
You can build a perfect world
out of reinforcement theory

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:44.930
all with environmentalism.

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:47.710
And I could have built
the exact same utopia

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:53.690
studying this with grasshoppers
as with humans-- boy, cat, dog,

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:54.700
rat, whatever.

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:56.090
They're all the same.

00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:59.790
So the building of American
behaviorism-- utter reliance

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:03.940
on environmentalism, utter
reliance on the notion that all

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:05.820
of behavior could
be explained-- could

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:08.940
be shaped by the
rewards and punishments,

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:11.770
the positive and negative
reinforcements of environment.

00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:15.590
And this works the same way
in every single type of animal

00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:18.300
out there, so you might as
well just study it in a rat,

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:19.340
in a pigeon.

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:22.900
Those were the two backbones
of behaviorist research.

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:24.800
Because they're a
lot more convenient.

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.030
And you can study it in
the lab, because it's

00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:28.490
the exact same thing.

00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:32.700
It is purely a function of the
environment you're controlling.

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:34.710
And you understand that.

00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:36.720
And as long as there is
some behavior coming out

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:39.720
the other end that you could
measure and generate numbers,

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:42.049
you are doing
scientific psychology,

00:08:42.049 --> 00:08:44.930
and this is what the
whole field was about.

00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:48.660
Meanwhile, over in Europe,
there was a totally different

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:50.870
tradition emerging.

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:54.530
And what it has its greatest
similarities to is--

00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:56.170
you know, you read
any of these books

00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:58.950
on the history of evolution,
and there's always

00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:01.510
this phase of like all
of these 19th century

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:04.820
British naturalists,
where like half of them

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:07.790
were Parsons in some
Anglican church or whatever.

00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:09.260
They always had to be Parsons.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.100
And they would always
be out trumping

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:13.989
around the woods of England
with a butterfly net.

00:09:13.989 --> 00:09:15.780
And these were the guys
who would come back

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:18.090
with a gazillion different
types of butterflies.

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:20.040
This is when
butterfly collecting

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:24.350
became this obsession with like
British, upper middle class

00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:27.054
and Parsons and stuff who would
just go out in the country.

00:09:27.054 --> 00:09:27.970
And what would you do?

00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:31.100
You would come back, and you
would generate these whatevers

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:35.310
of all the different types of
butterflies and just wallow

00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:37.090
in the variability.

00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:39.100
That was the main thing of it.

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:41.760
Look at all these
different colors.

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:44.470
Look at all these
different shapes of wings.

00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:47.520
The interpretation at the time
of course was, look at all

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:49.760
this glorious
variability of life

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:52.110
and God's work showing in it.

00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:55.400
But the main thing emotionally
that these guys were about

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:59.170
was variety-- the
range of differences,

00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:03.830
the range of different ways
that species could look like.

00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:06.900
And what this new field
was emerging in Europe

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:08.340
was ethology.

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:12.600
What ethology was about was
the same exact emotional pulse

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:16.090
as in those 19th century
Parsons with the butterfly nets.

00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:20.970
But what ethologists would do
is go out and collect behaviors.

00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:25.530
And they would come back, and
they would just wallow and just

00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:27.950
be buoyant by all of
the different types

00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:30.240
of behavioral variety.

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:32.470
And that's the most
important thing.

00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:34.270
So we can see right
off the bat, they

00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:36.130
are not going to be
getting along very

00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:38.520
well with the behaviorists--
with the rat equals boy

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:40.320
equals hippo business there.

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:42.390
Because what these
guys were all about

00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:47.150
was just the sheer variety of
behavior and, implicit in that,

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:51.170
how you have to study it
in natural environments.

00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:53.530
So there were three
guys during this period,

00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:55.780
beginning work early in
the 20th century, who

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:59.720
were the official godfathers
of the whole field of ethology.

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:04.180
One was Niko Tinbergen.
Next was Konrad Lorenz.

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:05.990
The next was Hugo Von Frisch.

00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:07.200
And these were the big three.

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:09.740
They eventually got
their Nobel prizes.

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:14.890
And Tinbergen was basically
a saint, an incredibly sort

00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:17.280
of accomplished,
interesting man who

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:19.870
did all sorts of
extraordinarily good things.

00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:22.860
Konrad Lorenz, as we
know, was Nazi scum.

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:27.620
And Hugo Von Frisch was just
really, really, really old.

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:30.980
Somehow he was just really
old from the very beginning.

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:34.130
And he was about 89 when
he got his Nobel price.

00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:37.060
These were the starting three
that began the whole field.

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:40.940
So we've got our archetypal
behaviorist villains there

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:44.660
with their shiny foreheads
leaning over the camera guy

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:46.380
and waving pigeons at them.

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:48.190
And what are the
ethologists about?

00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:51.620
All of them were guys with
these knobby knees and very

00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:55.370
hairy legs, with big thick
old hiking boots covered

00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:57.420
in mud and alpine whatevers.

00:11:57.420 --> 00:11:59.440
And what they were
doing was just

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:03.830
tromping around in the outside
world collecting behaviors,

00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:06.050
just looking at
the sheer variety.

00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:06.550
OK.

00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:09.060
It's obvious which team
I'm rooting for here.

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:13.360
But even, you know, that they
hung out with Konrad Lorenz.

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:13.860
OK.

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:17.150
The ethologists are
much more nuanced--

00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:20.800
the much broader, much
more multi-faceted,

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:22.660
diverse view of life there.

00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:26.690
The ethologists, completely
unconnected with behaviorism

00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:27.900
in the United States.

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:30.290
Instead, we're developing
this whole field

00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:34.260
premised on all sorts of
very different notions.

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:37.500
Behaviorists, this
radical environmentalism.

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:40.640
What ethology was
about, from day one,

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:44.390
was gene environment
interactions--

00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:49.550
behaviorist rules of positive
negative reinforcement.

00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:52.080
That explains the entire world.

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:55.320
As we'll see, some of the most
amazing things ethologists

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:59.010
came up with were examples
of animals acquiring

00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:03.790
new behaviors that broke every
rule on earth of behaviorism

00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:06.340
about how learning occurs.

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:08.650
Finally, over there
with the behaviorists,

00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:12.240
with their universality--
cat equals hippo--

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:15.030
and what the ethologists
were about was,

00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:19.410
every species solves its
environmental challenges,

00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:23.710
and its history of evolutionary
challenges, in a unique way.

00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:26.780
And out of that came
Tinbergen's famous quote.

00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:31.450
Which is, again, ethology is
the study of animal behavior,

00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:35.570
but where you're interviewing
the animal in its own language.

00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:37.540
And the whole
premise of ethology

00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:40.705
was, that's
preferable, and that's

00:13:40.705 --> 00:13:42.080
not going to happen
unless you're

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:45.180
out there in the nature in
the animal's real habitat.

00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:47.570
And you better be
real open minded

00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:51.130
as to what counts as
communication, as what

00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:53.780
counts to be the animal's
language that you

00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:55.920
are talking to it with.

00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:57.401
One example of this.

00:13:57.401 --> 00:13:59.400
And this was somewhat of
a different discipline,

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:01.950
but in the 1960s, there was
this very interesting sort

00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:04.580
of cottage industry of
research that came out.

00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:07.330
Which is, you take
a normal lab rat.

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:09.030
And now what you do
instead is put it

00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:10.840
in an enriched environment.

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:14.210
You put it in a big
enclosure with lots

00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:19.160
of other rats and beeping toys
and interesting smells and cell

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:21.710
phones and all sorts
of sounds of that sort.

00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:25.520
And what they would show
was landmark-- take a rat

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:27.920
and put it in an
enriched environment

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:30.860
and-- in 1960s neurobiology,
of a type we've

00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:34.130
heard about already--
you get a thicker cortex.

00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:36.870
People went wild
over that in terms

00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:39.060
of enriching the environment.

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:42.400
This prompted a
gazillion studies

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:47.330
during the '60s built around
this very Great Society '60s

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:48.800
optimism about things.

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:52.050
The Head Start program
emerged during that period

00:14:52.050 --> 00:14:55.106
out of a demonstration that
all sorts of privations

00:14:55.106 --> 00:14:57.640
in various points of
life, early in life,

00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:00.419
could be buffered,
reversed, by the right sort

00:15:00.419 --> 00:15:01.460
of enriched environments.

00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:03.880
Incredibly influential.

00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:05.830
Billions of studies done.

00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:07.380
And hidden away
in the literature

00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:10.410
was one very interesting study.

00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:15.240
Which is, when you took these
enrichment sort of Poobahs

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:17.960
there-- and now, what
they did in this one study

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:20.970
was they studied wild rats.

00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:22.540
And they brought in wild rats.

00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:25.880
And what they saw was, even
without the enrichment--

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:28.340
you didn't need to do a
thing about enrichment.

00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:32.990
You take the best environmental
enrichment laboratory paradigm

00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:35.770
to get you the
thickest cortex around,

00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:39.530
and it's not going to be
as thick as in a wild rat.

00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:43.110
And these guys were not-- these
guys were not ethologists,

00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:45.860
but this is exactly
the sort of thing

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:48.180
that ethology is built around.

00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:51.780
You were not going to be seeing
normal behavior in a cage,

00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:53.510
looking at a rat in there.

00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:56.590
That's like studying dolphins
swimming in a bath tub.

00:15:56.590 --> 00:15:58.990
You are going to be missing
everything under those.

00:15:58.990 --> 00:16:02.560
And, whoa, there is
stuff going on out there.

00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:05.090
If a wild rat has
a thicker cortex

00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:06.790
than we know how
to come up with,

00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:10.010
we need to be studying animals
in their natural setting.

00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:10.510
OK.

00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:13.730
So that was their basic
sort of call to arms.

00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:16.450
What ethologists worked
out were a number

00:16:16.450 --> 00:16:20.900
a very clear experimental
approaches built

00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:25.590
around a whole bunch of the
W questions-- who, and what,

00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:28.770
and where, and why, or whatever
it is we did in fifth grade.

00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:30.120
Here's what they looked at.

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:34.120
They looked at, first,
what was the behavior?

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:35.240
What was the behaviors?

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:37.510
We'll see they had a certain
jargony term for it--

00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:39.160
fixed action patterns.

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:42.920
And what we'll see
about it is this

00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:46.490
is a very specific realm
of types of behavior

00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:50.190
that had a very interesting
subtle relationship with things

00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:51.660
like instinct.

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:52.510
Next.

00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:55.800
What in the outside
world triggered

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:58.060
that behavior to occur?

00:16:58.060 --> 00:17:00.800
And their jargon
stuff, terminology--

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:05.020
what was the environmental
releasing stimulus that

00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:09.750
caused this fixed action
pattern to come out?

00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:10.650
Next.

00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:13.950
Dramatically different from
where the behaviorists were--

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:16.630
what's going on in
that organism's head

00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:21.440
so that that releasing stimulus
triggers the fixed action

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:22.730
pattern to occur?

00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:25.290
What are the
intervening mechanisms?

00:17:25.290 --> 00:17:27.859
What are the innate
releasing mechanism,

00:17:27.859 --> 00:17:29.930
was the jargon
they came up with.

00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:32.590
Very jargony, middle
European stuff.

00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:35.110
But what's going on
in an animal's head?

00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:36.800
What's the behavior?

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:38.990
What triggered it outside there?

00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:42.580
What's the machinery that
took that releasing stimulus

00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:45.140
in the environment and
turned it into the behavior?

00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:47.540
And finally, a realm
which connects them

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:50.760
with evolution type
people, what's the value?

00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:53.580
What's the adaptive
value of that behavior?

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:56.100
And what we'll see
is that question

00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:58.730
meant an utterly different
world to ethologists than it

00:17:58.730 --> 00:18:01.390
did to evolution people.

00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:02.030
OK.

00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:05.000
So starting off, those
fixed action patterns.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.590
Fixed action patterns,
when you first

00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:08.900
begin to learn how
ethologists thought about it,

00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:12.300
you immediately sense they're
talking about instincts.

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:14.230
They're talking about reflexes.

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:15.710
They were definitely not.

00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:20.120
And terms like instinct had
incredibly dirty connotations

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:22.810
among psychologists and animal
behaviorists around that time,

00:18:22.810 --> 00:18:26.590
just because, like an
earlier period, animals,

00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:30.310
humans had instincts
for maternal behavior,

00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:32.600
and instincts for
inevitable aggression,

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:34.810
and instincts for
entrepreneurship,

00:18:34.810 --> 00:18:38.570
and instincts for-- and it was
a totally meaningless term,

00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:41.020
because it described
anything that you wanted

00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:43.600
to say was something
that's supposed to happen

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:45.660
and that I'm good at doing.

00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:48.060
What you had instead,
in their view,

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:50.460
was something much more subtle.

00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:54.290
A fixed action pattern
is not maternalism.

00:18:54.290 --> 00:18:57.370
A fixed action pattern
is not entrepreneurship.

00:18:57.370 --> 00:19:01.480
A fixed action pattern is a
relatively tractable piece

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:06.170
of behavior involving a bunch
of interconnected muscles

00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:09.780
and producing this
characteristic behavior which

00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:12.640
had a meaning to it.

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:13.260
OK.

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:14.290
Nice and abstract.

00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:16.060
We will see example shortly.

00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:19.980
But what they also had, that
separated it from instincts

00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:23.500
by miles and miles,
was animals didn't

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:26.380
have to learn how to do it.

00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:28.770
It was hardwired,
but animals had

00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:31.580
to learn how to do it better.

00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:36.010
And that was an amazing insight
in terms of gene environment

00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:36.780
interactions.

00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:39.640
The word gene was not appearing
in their thinking at the time.

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:41.880
But fixed action patterns.

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:45.420
In other words,
experience could change

00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:48.000
the way you do the
fixed action pattern.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.020
Or, already harking back
to the molecular lecture

00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:55.580
and that obsession with if/then
clauses, what experience mostly

00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:59.280
would do is not so much change
the nature of the fixed action

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:02.200
pattern but change the context.

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:05.960
Teaching you when to
do it, when not to.

00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:10.060
If/then clauses of, if
this environmental event

00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:14.460
is happening, then bring
out this cohesive set

00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:18.030
of behaviors that have at least
some superficial resemblance

00:20:18.030 --> 00:20:20.460
to instinct but doesn't
hold up for long.

00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:21.810
This was really important.

00:20:21.810 --> 00:20:22.460
OK.

00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:23.900
So what would be examples?

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:27.470
What does this look like-- a
behavior where animals simply

00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:30.490
know how to do it without
learning, without experience?

00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:32.800
And they can do it
right from the start

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:35.050
and nonetheless
experience shapes that.

00:20:35.050 --> 00:20:38.530
Obviously, first example was
all of Charlotte's babies

00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:42.020
knowing how to say salutations
within a few seconds of being

00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:42.660
born there.

00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:46.000
And no doubt they would soon
learn who not to say that to.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.800
Classic example.

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:50.650
And this was one that
Lorenz studied for years

00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:54.000
and always wanted to have the
pig killed because Nazi scum.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:54.500
OK.

00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:56.350
But anyway, I digress.

00:20:56.350 --> 00:20:58.030
And other examples.

00:20:58.030 --> 00:20:59.500
You take a squirrel.

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:02.350
You take a squirrel that's
been raised in a cage

00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:04.920
without ever seeing another
squirrel-- a squirrel that

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:08.090
has subsisted on nothing
but a liquid diet

00:21:08.090 --> 00:21:09.640
and that kind of thing.

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:13.450
And give it a nut, and it
will know how to crack it.

00:21:13.450 --> 00:21:16.880
It will know to carry out
this fixed action pattern.

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:20.090
This is not an instinct
for food acquisition.

00:21:20.090 --> 00:21:23.880
This is something instinctual
for how you hold this thing

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:25.700
and where you chew
on it or whatever

00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:27.100
it is that squirrels do.

00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:27.930
It's in there.

00:21:27.930 --> 00:21:31.020
The squirrel doesn't have
to learn how to do it.

00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:33.360
But what you see is,
you take that squirrel

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:36.120
without any prior experience
with nut cracking,

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:40.220
and you look at them over time,
and they get better at it!

00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:41.970
They do it faster.

00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:45.610
They get a larger percentage
of whatever's inside there.

00:21:45.610 --> 00:21:50.220
They have a basic, hardwired
fixed action pattern--

00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:55.010
a bunch of coordinated muscles
doing a coherent set behavior,

00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:57.670
and it is shaped by experience.

00:21:57.670 --> 00:22:01.080
In this case, they learn
how to do it better.

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:02.710
Another example.

00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:07.350
This is one where you have
any of those intro psych books

00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:09.820
from anywhere in
1950s, '60s or so,

00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:12.340
and there was this
inevitable picture where

00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:14.800
you had-- it was this room.

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:20.130
There was this surface, and
it had a checkerboard linoleum

00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:20.780
on it.

00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:22.440
And the surface
came to around here,

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:24.590
and then it dropped
down about three feet

00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:26.540
and then continued the
same on the bottom.

00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:29.250
It was always the same
checkerboard linoleum.

00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:32.694
Linoleum which was like worth
its weight in gold at the time.

00:22:32.694 --> 00:22:35.110
Linoleum which was going to
make life better for everyone.

00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:38.770
So you had this checkered
linoleum thing there.

00:22:38.770 --> 00:22:41.780
And the critical thing
was right around here.

00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:44.760
When the wall dropped
down, right here

00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:48.350
was a sheet of glass
that continued out there.

00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:52.480
In other words, the actual
floor would continue here

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:56.120
on the glass, while it was
also dropping down to this.

00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:58.740
And what was always in
one of those pictures

00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:03.880
would be some adorable, cute
baby animal sitting out there

00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:07.140
on the glass,
totally freaking out.

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:10.840
Because it's out there, and
it's looking way down there,

00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:14.770
and there's stuff-- a yawning
chasm below of three feet--

00:23:14.770 --> 00:23:18.850
and you are eliciting what was
called a visual cliff response.

00:23:18.850 --> 00:23:21.280
Which is, get me out of here!

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:22.910
I'm floating up in the air here.

00:23:22.910 --> 00:23:26.450
You did not have to have animals
who already had experience

00:23:26.450 --> 00:23:29.150
by trial and error
learning that when

00:23:29.150 --> 00:23:32.150
you're floating in the air,
that tends not to last for long.

00:23:32.150 --> 00:23:33.800
And you go to
[INAUDIBLE] afterward.

00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:36.080
There was no-- it's
there in the first place.

00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:38.360
You take a baby dog.

00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:40.000
You take a baby human.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.130
You take a baby blue
whale, whatever.

00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:44.140
And you push them out
on the glass there,

00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:47.630
and they look down, and
they totally freak out.

00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:51.630
Unless they're a baby sloth.

00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:52.790
Oh!

00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:54.400
Isn't that kind of interesting?

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:57.100
Because if you're a baby
sloth who gets freaked out

00:23:57.100 --> 00:23:59.050
by yawning space
underneath you, you

00:23:59.050 --> 00:24:00.930
are not going to be
a very functioning

00:24:00.930 --> 00:24:02.810
sloth when you grow up there.

00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:06.530
Oh, species specific
fixed action patterns. ,

00:24:06.530 --> 00:24:10.840
Where in this case, this visual
cliff could evoke this whole

00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:14.710
fixed action pattern of
panic responses, all of that.

00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:16.600
So where does the
learning come in?

00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:19.170
You push this poor
animal out there enough

00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:21.510
times-- the 40th time,
the elephant's out there,

00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:24.060
and it begins to learn.

00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:25.550
I don't know what's
up with this,

00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:28.650
because this gravity business
is making sense otherwise.

00:24:28.650 --> 00:24:31.670
But it seems to be
OK when I'm out here.

00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:35.060
You could habituate the
visual cliff response.

00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:39.880
But all sorts of animals--
except for arboreal ones

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:42.490
hanging up there--
all sorts of species

00:24:42.490 --> 00:24:46.180
didn't have to have prior
experience with not liking

00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:48.270
to drop down open spaces.

00:24:48.270 --> 00:24:49.820
It was there already.

00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:52.580
They learn the context better.

00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:56.370
Another example of this
that the ethologists showed.

00:24:56.370 --> 00:24:57.830
These were with
captive primates.

00:24:57.830 --> 00:25:00.495
You take a monkey who
was raised in isolation,

00:25:00.495 --> 00:25:03.060
who has never seen
another monkey,

00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:05.130
and at some point
in adolescence.

00:25:05.130 --> 00:25:06.380
It's a male monkey.

00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:11.040
And you sit him down,
and you show him a film.

00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:13.340
And the film
consists of the face

00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:18.350
of a huge, scary male monkey
of the same species giving

00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:20.610
a threatening display,
which is usually

00:25:20.610 --> 00:25:22.630
displaying the canines there.

00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:27.140
And this is a monkey who has no
prior experience with monkeys.

00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:29.140
It has never seen
a monkey before.

00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:32.300
All of its interactions have
been with Barney or whatever,

00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:34.240
knows nothing about any of this.

00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:37.620
And you show it that, and
it will freak out and give

00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:41.130
a fixed action pattern--
a subordinate gesture

00:25:41.130 --> 00:25:44.650
crouching down and not
making eye contact.

00:25:44.650 --> 00:25:45.530
Whoa!

00:25:45.530 --> 00:25:46.990
Where'd that come from?

00:25:46.990 --> 00:25:49.700
No learning from
trial and error.

00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:52.640
It was simply there as
a fixed action pattern--

00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:54.520
a whole bunch of
things that the monkey

00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:57.900
does with its torso,
its face, all of that.

00:25:57.900 --> 00:26:00.140
Where does experience come in?

00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:03.360
The monkey needs to learn
that you give a subordinating

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:06.610
gesture like that to
some big, scary animal,

00:26:06.610 --> 00:26:08.230
you don't give it to infants.

00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:11.910
It needs to learn the
right social context.

00:26:11.910 --> 00:26:13.750
So that's where it comes in.

00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:17.160
So you've got all these
examples of behaviors that are

00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:19.880
hardwired, whatever that means.

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:23.590
And what you have, nonetheless,
is shaping by experience.

00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:25.670
And this is what the
ethologists learned.

00:26:25.670 --> 00:26:28.260
And what was clear after
awhile was all sorts of animals

00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:30.550
already knew all about ethology.

00:26:30.550 --> 00:26:33.540
They understood what a
fixed action pattern was.

00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:34.750
As follows.

00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:38.110
Type of monkey in East
Africa called vervet monkeys.

00:26:38.110 --> 00:26:40.860
If you were a vervet monkey,
there are three things on Earth

00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:42.030
that terrify you.

00:26:42.030 --> 00:26:44.400
One is a leopard.

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:48.950
Another is a snake, and
the third is an eagle.

00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:51.080
Leopards come from below.

00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:52.650
Snakes come from below.

00:26:52.650 --> 00:26:54.310
Eagles come from above.

00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:56.060
And what you have
in vervet monkeys

00:26:56.060 --> 00:26:59.790
are fixed action
patterns of alarm calls

00:26:59.790 --> 00:27:02.210
that they give when spotting
one of the predators.

00:27:02.210 --> 00:27:05.960
They have different alarm
calls for each of the species.

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:09.540
And what has been
shown is, you fly over

00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:12.960
the silhouette of a
perfectly nice bird there

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:14.760
that's not going to
try to carry it away,

00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:16.020
and you don't elicit it.

00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:18.530
It's not just things
going on up there.

00:27:18.530 --> 00:27:23.050
It's a fixed action pattern
for scary, terrifying stuff up

00:27:23.050 --> 00:27:27.070
above verses scary, terrifying
stuff below with four legs,

00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:30.610
versus scary, terrifying
below with no legs at all.

00:27:30.610 --> 00:27:34.580
And they all know how to do
this without prior experience.

00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:37.520
But what goes on
is the same thing

00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:39.450
that makes it a fixed
action pattern, which

00:27:39.450 --> 00:27:42.860
is it can be sculpted
by experience.

00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:44.360
What am I saying here?

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:46.990
Which is, you are a
young vervet monkey,

00:27:46.990 --> 00:27:49.460
and you've got these
fixed action patterns.

00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:50.470
That's great!

00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:54.530
What you have to learn how to
do, though, is not screw up

00:27:54.530 --> 00:27:57.710
and say, oh my god, there's an
eagle, when you actually should

00:27:57.710 --> 00:27:59.210
be saying, there's a leopard.

00:27:59.210 --> 00:28:01.270
Because if you say,
there's an eagle,

00:28:01.270 --> 00:28:03.094
everyone's going to
run down the tree.

00:28:03.094 --> 00:28:04.510
And if you say,
there's a leopard,

00:28:04.510 --> 00:28:06.300
everybody's going
to run up the tree!

00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:09.350
And you get some kid
who gets it backwards,

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:11.810
and that's going to have
some bad consequences.

00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:15.550
How do you know adult vervet
monkeys have studied ethology

00:28:15.550 --> 00:28:16.970
and fixed action patterns?

00:28:16.970 --> 00:28:19.340
Because they don't
listen to the kid

00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:22.860
until some adult agrees
with them, because they know

00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:26.530
this is some dumbass kid that
doesn't know the language yet

00:28:26.530 --> 00:28:29.300
very well and makes mistakes.

00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:31.940
Under a certain
age, adult vervets

00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:35.220
don't respond to alarm calls
other than with vigilance,

00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:37.710
trying to figure out what
the kid's talking about,

00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:41.370
until it is seconded
by an adult.

00:28:41.370 --> 00:28:44.010
So what about fixed
action patterns in humans?

00:28:44.010 --> 00:28:47.440
Classic example--
infant smiling,

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:51.060
involving all sorts
of muscles that who

00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:52.650
knows what's involved in them?

00:28:52.650 --> 00:28:55.220
All sorts of muscles
that produce this

00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:57.280
without prior experience.

00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:58.430
How do you know?

00:28:58.430 --> 00:29:02.000
Fiberoptic mysteries
show that fetuses

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.030
smile at various points.

00:29:04.030 --> 00:29:04.880
What else?

00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:07.880
You will see smiling
in blind babies.

00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:10.770
So there's no visual
information coming in.

00:29:10.770 --> 00:29:11.840
What's smiling?

00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:13.050
It's a fixed action pattern.

00:29:13.050 --> 00:29:14.220
Where's the learning?

00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:16.470
Learning who to smile at.

00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:19.150
Learning that mannequins
aren't going to smile back

00:29:19.150 --> 00:29:21.020
at you and things of that sort.

00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:23.710
That's it being
shaped by experience.

00:29:23.710 --> 00:29:26.330
More fixed action patterns.

00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:31.000
Infants are not having to have
trial and error experience

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.000
with learning there's this thing
you do with your mouth right

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.490
after you're born that keeps
you from being really, really

00:29:36.490 --> 00:29:38.826
hungry, and it's called nursing.

00:29:38.826 --> 00:29:41.010
Oh, can somebody
demonstrate that for me?

00:29:41.010 --> 00:29:42.750
That's a fixed action pattern.

00:29:42.750 --> 00:29:46.630
What happens is, kids get more
and more efficient at it--

00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:49.960
the number of calories they
can consume per unit of time.

00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:51.900
They get better at doing it.

00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:54.280
More fixed action
patterns in humans.

00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:57.480
Every culture on earth,
people raising their eyebrows

00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:59.040
and greeting to somebody.

00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:01.050
Every culture on
earth, people can

00:30:01.050 --> 00:30:04.570
recognize what anger looks
like, what fear looks like,

00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:07.250
what disgust, what
contempt, all of those.

00:30:07.250 --> 00:30:09.610
These are all fixed
action patterns.

00:30:09.610 --> 00:30:11.480
And where does the
context come in?

00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:15.120
With all of them obviously
learning when you interpret

00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:16.860
this as good news, bad news.

00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:19.640
When you pretend you
don't see it, all of that.

00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:21.690
Learning the social context.

00:30:21.690 --> 00:30:25.510
So humans are absolutely full
of fixed action patterns.

00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:28.610
Next, the next sort of question
that the ethologists would

00:30:28.610 --> 00:30:30.770
ask after getting
to this point of,

00:30:30.770 --> 00:30:34.490
what's the behavior-- what does
learning have to do with it?

00:30:34.490 --> 00:30:37.550
And now asking the
question-- the same one

00:30:37.550 --> 00:30:40.120
the evolutionary folks
would ask-- which is, well,

00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:41.400
what's the benefit of it?

00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:43.600
What's the adaptive value?

00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:45.810
And a totally different
way of thinking about it

00:30:45.810 --> 00:30:47.310
than the evolution people.

00:30:47.310 --> 00:30:50.260
The evolution folks going
on with adaptive value,

00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:53.770
which is it allows you to pass
on more copies of your genes.

00:30:53.770 --> 00:30:56.217
And over the generations,
the prevalence of that trait

00:30:56.217 --> 00:30:57.050
becomes more common.

00:30:57.050 --> 00:31:00.470
What the ethologists did
instead were experiments.

00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:04.230
They simply went and
experimented to see what

00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:06.430
this information--
what these fixed action

00:31:06.430 --> 00:31:08.910
patterns-- actually meant.

00:31:08.910 --> 00:31:11.640
So Tinbergen was famous
for one of those.

00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:15.580
Which was there was like
some gull something or other

00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:18.870
that he would study, and
the outside of gull eggs

00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:20.260
were all speckled.

00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:22.730
And there would be this very
distinctive fixed action

00:31:22.730 --> 00:31:25.060
pattern shortly after
the chicks pop out,

00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:28.480
which is mom would go around
systematically turning over

00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:32.250
all the fragments of egg
where the white of egg shell--

00:31:32.250 --> 00:31:34.750
where the white was facing
up-- and would turn it

00:31:34.750 --> 00:31:38.580
over so that the speckled
part was facing up.

00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:39.479
Whoa!

00:31:39.479 --> 00:31:40.770
That's an interesting behavior.

00:31:40.770 --> 00:31:43.450
Does that make that gull
more attractive to males

00:31:43.450 --> 00:31:45.940
and thus pass on more
copies of her genes?

00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:49.250
But, no, here's
what Tinbergen does.

00:31:49.250 --> 00:31:52.150
He goes in with these gulls
who just finished doing it

00:31:52.150 --> 00:31:56.760
and with her new pups,
chicks-- her new chicks

00:31:56.760 --> 00:31:58.040
just having hatched.

00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:00.400
And she goes off to get
them food or whatever.

00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:04.860
And this total vicious,
heartless Tinbergen sneaks in,

00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:07.920
and he turns the shells
back over to white.

00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:09.040
And what happens?

00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:11.630
All sorts of raptors
flying around up

00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:14.510
there are better at spotting
down there that there's

00:32:14.510 --> 00:32:18.310
all these baby chicks, who
are gone by the time mom

00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:19.240
comes back.

00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:19.890
Tragically.

00:32:19.890 --> 00:32:22.220
I know!

00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:24.280
And I'm complaining
about Lorenz?

00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:25.590
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:26.090
OK.

00:32:26.090 --> 00:32:29.790
But that's showing, oh, why
do gull mothers, shortly

00:32:29.790 --> 00:32:32.480
after giving birth, go through
this interesting collection

00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:35.230
of motoric movements which they
don't have to learn how to do,

00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:36.700
flipping these things over?

00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:39.030
Does this make
their groups better

00:32:39.030 --> 00:32:41.760
to out-compete those with
the next Ice Age comes?

00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:42.630
No.

00:32:42.630 --> 00:32:44.910
It's because you turn it
over so that some predator

00:32:44.910 --> 00:32:46.590
up there in the sky
can't see the egg

00:32:46.590 --> 00:32:49.500
shells-- the adaptive value.

00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:50.240
Next.

00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:52.020
Next example of
this-- and this is

00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:55.320
like one of the most famous,
iconic sort of stories

00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:57.300
to come out of
ethology-- this was

00:32:57.300 --> 00:33:03.350
the work of Von Frisch showing
bee dancing, bee communication.

00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:06.990
And what bees are about
is-- they're scary,

00:33:06.990 --> 00:33:09.540
and they go find out
about food sources.

00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:11.870
And they fly back
to their colony.

00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:15.190
And what they need to do is
communicate to everybody else

00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:17.470
that they have
found a food source.

00:33:17.470 --> 00:33:21.090
And they have to communicate all
sorts of types of information.

00:33:21.090 --> 00:33:22.900
Which direction?

00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:24.480
How far?

00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:25.690
How much?

00:33:25.690 --> 00:33:28.680
Is it totally exciting,
or is it, I just stumbled

00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:29.680
into a little bit?

00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:32.000
And what Von Frisch
was able to work out

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.530
was bees came back and did
this fixed action pattern

00:33:35.530 --> 00:33:38.760
movement which has been seen
in every bee species on Earth.

00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:42.380
Which is, they do this
figure eight, a waggle dance.

00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:44.720
They're shaking their
rear back and forth.

00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:46.700
And they're moving
over the floor

00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:49.300
of the hive, where everybody
is watching and cheering them

00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:52.400
on, and going around and
doing this figure eight.

00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:54.200
And what is this about?

00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:56.670
What is this about?

00:33:56.670 --> 00:33:59.080
Von Frisch was
able to dissect it,

00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:03.320
and with brilliant, experimental
tricks showing the bee

00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:05.780
was giving three
pieces of information.

00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:09.580
The axis of the figure
eight told the bees,

00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:11.989
with respect to
sunlight, which direction

00:34:11.989 --> 00:34:14.820
to go to find the source.

00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:18.920
The longer the bee danced, the
further away the food source

00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:20.150
was.

00:34:20.150 --> 00:34:23.679
And the more frantically it
was wiggling its rear around,

00:34:23.679 --> 00:34:26.739
the more exciting of
a food source it was.

00:34:26.739 --> 00:34:28.659
This was information.

00:34:28.659 --> 00:34:30.440
This was what's
the adaptive value.

00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:33.006
So Von Frisch is sitting
there saying, well, I

00:34:33.006 --> 00:34:34.880
think it might mean
this, because I'm finding

00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:36.230
this interesting pattern.

00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:37.205
I may speculate.

00:34:37.205 --> 00:34:37.830
What do you do?

00:34:37.830 --> 00:34:39.659
You do an experiment instead.

00:34:39.659 --> 00:34:41.980
Which is, now you
take a beehive,

00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:46.310
and you put it on
a bar stool thing.

00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:48.510
And it's sitting out
there in the field,

00:34:48.510 --> 00:34:50.236
and you grab some bee.

00:34:50.236 --> 00:34:52.860
And I don't know how he did it,
but he lived to a ripe old age.

00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:56.429
But you grab a bee, and you
give it some amazing food

00:34:56.429 --> 00:35:00.060
source out here, and you
let it fly back to the hive

00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:02.890
where it goes berserk with
the waggle dance stuff,

00:35:02.890 --> 00:35:06.320
telling everybody there's
something amazing over there.

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:09.160
Meanwhile, Von Frisch,
in his hiking boots,

00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:12.240
is slithering on his
belly towards the beehive

00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:14.840
with the piano stool, and
comes up underneath it,

00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:19.200
and rotates it--
rotates it 180 degrees.

00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:20.890
And what happens then?

00:35:20.890 --> 00:35:23.350
Everybody in the hive
comes barreling out

00:35:23.350 --> 00:35:25.000
and goes in the wrong direction!

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.120
Because they were
given directions

00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:30.880
as to where to go with respect
to the hive's entrance.

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:34.260
That's how you show it
actually contained information.

00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:36.980
And then he would have the
food source closer or further,

00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:38.660
and show the length
of the dancing

00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:40.420
and all sorts of
other cruel things

00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:43.140
he would do to the hive to
confuse them and wipe out

00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:44.950
the credibility of that one bee.

00:35:44.950 --> 00:35:47.820
But this is how you
get the information.

00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:50.190
He would show this
explicitly-- oh,

00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:54.190
why do they do this fascinating
fixed action pattern?

00:35:54.190 --> 00:35:56.320
Because they're
telling them something!

00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:57.960
And here's how you prove it.

00:35:57.960 --> 00:35:59.640
And you rotate it around.

00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:02.700
So you can begin to see
the ethologists were really

00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:05.170
good, clever experimentalists.

00:36:05.170 --> 00:36:06.960
And they were just
trying to do it

00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:09.800
in the animal's own language.

00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:13.660
This became really clear when
you study their next category

00:36:13.660 --> 00:36:16.440
of questions-- that
business of, well, what

00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:19.400
is it that just happened
in the outside world that

00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:22.390
triggered this fixed
action pattern to occur?

00:36:22.390 --> 00:36:25.130
What was the sensory trigger?

00:36:25.130 --> 00:36:28.120
Their jargon-- what was
the releasing stimulus?

00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:31.091
And they had general
strategies for doing this.

00:36:31.091 --> 00:36:31.590
OK.

00:36:31.590 --> 00:36:34.990
You were speculating
that this site

00:36:34.990 --> 00:36:37.030
is the thing that
triggers whatever

00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:38.770
this behavior in this animal.

00:36:38.770 --> 00:36:40.410
How do you begin to test it?

00:36:40.410 --> 00:36:43.740
Let's remove the-- OK, enough
with the abstract stuff.

00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:47.730
Baby birds-- baby
gulls or something--

00:36:47.730 --> 00:36:50.790
peck at mom's
mouth, at her beak.

00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:55.590
And that is meant to get mom to
regurgitate some exciting food.

00:36:55.590 --> 00:36:57.260
How do they know how to do this?

00:36:57.260 --> 00:36:59.580
What is it that gets
them to do this behavior?

00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:02.800
On mom's beak, there's
a little red circle.

00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:05.886
And the early ethologists
noting that, oh,

00:37:05.886 --> 00:37:07.010
that's kind of interesting.

00:37:07.010 --> 00:37:09.290
I wonder if they're looking
at the red circle there?

00:37:09.290 --> 00:37:11.130
I wonder if that's the
thing that's causing

00:37:11.130 --> 00:37:13.070
them to start this behavior?

00:37:13.070 --> 00:37:16.490
What were the experimental
techniques for saying, oh,

00:37:16.490 --> 00:37:21.320
is a red circle on mom's
beak a releasing stimulus

00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:23.690
for this fixed action
pattern of pecking?

00:37:23.690 --> 00:37:25.610
Let's do an experiment.

00:37:25.610 --> 00:37:27.500
And the standard
experimental models

00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:31.980
they would have would be to
subtract out the thing that you

00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:33.420
think is the stimulus.

00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:36.330
Take mom and white out
her little red circle

00:37:36.330 --> 00:37:39.250
there and see if the
kids no longer peck.

00:37:39.250 --> 00:37:40.670
Replacement.

00:37:40.670 --> 00:37:42.880
Which is, now you've
done that to mom.

00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:44.880
And you draw a little
red circle back,

00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:47.860
and you see if they
start pecking again.

00:37:47.860 --> 00:37:50.740
Replacement substitution.

00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:52.700
Now you take something
completely different.

00:37:52.700 --> 00:37:56.890
You put some neon
triangle on mom's beak,

00:37:56.890 --> 00:37:59.380
and you see if you will
elicit the same-- oh, what's

00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:00.990
the specificity of it?

00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:03.230
Finally, the thing
that they really

00:38:03.230 --> 00:38:05.070
specialized in--
which is now you

00:38:05.070 --> 00:38:07.400
would do what they
called super stimulation.

00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:10.220
Which is, you wave a piece of
paper in front of the chick

00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:13.460
there-- that you've drawn
a gigantic red circle on--

00:38:13.460 --> 00:38:16.080
and you see if it goes out
of its mind and pecks at it

00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:17.540
like there's no tomorrow.

00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:19.810
Experimental
approaches like this.

00:38:19.810 --> 00:38:23.030
If you take away this thing,
does the fixed action pattern

00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:23.940
no longer occur?

00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:25.680
If you put it back,
does it work again?

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:27.890
If you replace it
with something else,

00:38:27.890 --> 00:38:29.960
if you exaggerate
the traits, do you

00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:31.790
get even more of the behavior?

00:38:31.790 --> 00:38:34.080
These were the
standard approaches

00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:35.470
for figuring this out.

00:38:35.470 --> 00:38:37.760
And ethology types
who were interested

00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:40.050
in this realm of
releasing stimuli,

00:38:40.050 --> 00:38:43.310
the thing they have gotten
incredible mileage out

00:38:43.310 --> 00:38:47.140
of recent years is making
little robotic animals.

00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:50.220
Because you could program
to do certain behaviors,

00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:53.330
and you could see if you
could elicit everybody else

00:38:53.330 --> 00:38:54.850
to respond to the behaviors.

00:38:54.850 --> 00:38:57.360
And, of course, the
first ones were all sorts

00:38:57.360 --> 00:39:01.070
of techie folks building
robotic bees who could

00:39:01.070 --> 00:39:03.270
dance in certain dimensions.

00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:05.020
And they would
stick him in there

00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:07.710
and wind up the
gear shaft thing.

00:39:07.710 --> 00:39:10.060
And they would just
dance away, and they

00:39:10.060 --> 00:39:12.530
could get the other
bees to go flying off

00:39:12.530 --> 00:39:15.440
someplace-- the bees not
being very discriminating as

00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:17.640
to which dancers they
pay attention to.

00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:21.670
But the point there was,
this was a substitution--

00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:26.720
a mechanical substitution
for that releasing stimulus.

00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:29.670
Or there's some amazing
paper a couple years ago,

00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:32.370
where somebody made
a robotic cockroach

00:39:32.370 --> 00:39:35.670
and was able to trick all the
other cockroaches into doing

00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:37.660
some sort of imprudent behavior.

00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:41.500
And so you see this is high
tech versions of this approach.

00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:45.180
Oh, it might be this stimulus
that's-- let's replicate it.

00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:47.280
Let's make it even
more exciting.

00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:49.420
So using this approach,
the ethologists

00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:51.550
would begin to figure
out, what is it

00:39:51.550 --> 00:39:54.740
in the sensory world of this
animal that caused that fixed

00:39:54.740 --> 00:39:56.110
action pattern to occur?

00:39:56.110 --> 00:39:58.830
And it was never more
than in this domain

00:39:58.830 --> 00:40:02.220
that they were doing that whole
sound byte about interviewing

00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:03.710
an animal in its own language.

00:40:03.710 --> 00:40:07.810
Because what it's all about is
recognizing other species out

00:40:07.810 --> 00:40:10.700
there are functioning
in sensory modalities

00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:12.920
we can't even guess at.

00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:14.750
What they began to see.

00:40:14.750 --> 00:40:18.600
One example-- the sorts
of auditory stimuli

00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:20.970
that would trigger
fixed action patterns.

00:40:20.970 --> 00:40:23.900
One example-- deer moose.

00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:28.050
Big things.

00:40:28.050 --> 00:40:29.710
What are they called?

00:40:29.710 --> 00:40:30.800
Elk!

00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:32.380
Elk!

00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:35.970
Is elk a female
name for-- bulls.

00:40:35.970 --> 00:40:36.480
OK.

00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:40.950
So you get Bullwinkles there.

00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:45.300
And what he's doing is he
is trying to find a mate.

00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:46.670
And how does he do it?

00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:49.850
What they do, when they use
northern Minnesotan beasts,

00:40:49.850 --> 00:40:51.900
is they bellow.

00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:53.870
They give these
bellowing calls that

00:40:53.870 --> 00:40:55.660
are heard for miles and miles.

00:40:55.660 --> 00:40:57.520
Male deer-- I guess it's deer.

00:40:57.520 --> 00:40:58.020
OK.

00:40:58.020 --> 00:40:58.635
They bellow.

00:40:58.635 --> 00:41:01.040
It could be heard miles away.

00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:03.390
And if you were the
right kind of female,

00:41:03.390 --> 00:41:06.380
and you hear some guy
bellowing in the next valley,

00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:07.980
do you know what you do?

00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:10.160
You ovulate.

00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:13.040
Auditory induced ovulation.

00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:16.317
And not only that, you begin
to go try to find the guy.

00:41:16.317 --> 00:41:18.150
And when you get there,
you start this whole

00:41:18.150 --> 00:41:21.350
courting display thing, if
he's the right kind of guy

00:41:21.350 --> 00:41:23.380
and he expresses himself.

00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:26.960
And what you have there is--
what's the releasing stimulus?

00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:29.240
An auditory one.

00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:33.680
Even more bizarre--
discovering that rats,

00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:37.330
rats are responsive to
certain types of stimuli.

00:41:37.330 --> 00:41:40.290
For example, you tickle
them on their rib cage,

00:41:40.290 --> 00:41:42.710
and they giggle.

00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:43.310
Yes!

00:41:43.310 --> 00:41:47.570
Your tax dollars going on that
that could instead be spent

00:41:47.570 --> 00:41:49.750
on nuking something or other.

00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:51.810
What you've got
there is rats giggle.

00:41:51.810 --> 00:41:54.740
They giggle in an
ultrasonic range.

00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:57.450
So you can't hear it until
you've got some rat giggle

00:41:57.450 --> 00:41:58.780
decoder thing.

00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:01.277
And they giggle in
response to logical things.

00:42:01.277 --> 00:42:02.860
Like you tickle them,
and they giggle.

00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:04.790
And then they come
back for more.

00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:07.050
And you show all those
patterns with it.

00:42:07.050 --> 00:42:09.630
And if you get it at the
right frequency only,

00:42:09.630 --> 00:42:12.120
and they do this
giggling chirping thing,

00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:15.560
and you're releasing that
there, and other rats

00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:17.430
come over to check it out.

00:42:17.430 --> 00:42:21.490
Because the sound-- the
auditory releasing stimulus,

00:42:21.490 --> 00:42:25.160
in this case of rat chirping
giggling-- induces this,

00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:27.010
whoa, let's go see
where the party

00:42:27.010 --> 00:42:29.100
is response in the other rats.

00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:31.940
Another example of
this-- interesting thing

00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:34.350
that you see in various
species, including

00:42:34.350 --> 00:42:37.890
humans-- which is when
females are ovulating,

00:42:37.890 --> 00:42:40.420
their voices go a little higher.

00:42:40.420 --> 00:42:45.910
And studies showing that males
subliminally can detect this.

00:42:45.910 --> 00:42:50.470
More evidence of modality
supplying information we

00:42:50.470 --> 00:42:52.710
would never even guess at.

00:42:52.710 --> 00:42:53.580
OK.

00:42:53.580 --> 00:42:57.720
Then you can show releasing
stimuli in the visual domain.

00:42:57.720 --> 00:43:01.600
And one example of this
is that you have turkeys,

00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:04.880
and turkeys apparently do
their sexual attraction stuff

00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:05.870
visually.

00:43:05.870 --> 00:43:09.750
And this prompted one of the
cruelest, most savage studies

00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:12.340
I've ever seen, which
is trying to figure out

00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:15.710
what is it that
makes female turkeys

00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:17.750
attractive to male turkeys.

00:43:17.750 --> 00:43:20.680
And what they did was,
they would show the male,

00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:24.400
and they studied his
behavior for a long period.

00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:26.140
And the scientists
began to guess

00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:29.300
at what were the releasing
stimuli, the visual information

00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:32.230
from the female, that
would elicit this behavior?

00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:36.770
So they did the subtraction
substitution technique.

00:43:36.770 --> 00:43:40.100
They made themselves an
artificial female turkey.

00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:43.110
They took a big old
ball of Styrofoam,

00:43:43.110 --> 00:43:46.640
and they stuck this fake
turkey head on at one end.

00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:48.740
And they stuck a bunch
of feathery things

00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:51.640
at the other end and just stuck
it out there in the field.

00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:53.650
And, of course, the
idiot male turkeys

00:43:53.650 --> 00:43:56.760
instantly are like all around
the thing and courting it.

00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:58.630
And all, oh.

00:43:58.630 --> 00:44:00.980
So interesting visual stimuli.

00:44:00.980 --> 00:44:04.220
What about it actually
attracts the male?

00:44:04.220 --> 00:44:06.850
And here's where
the cruelty came in.

00:44:06.850 --> 00:44:10.180
They would begin to mess
with the artificial females.

00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:11.840
And I once saw a film of this.

00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:16.740
And like the empathy you feel
for this poor turkey guy there.

00:44:16.740 --> 00:44:19.010
Because they have a--
and he comes in there,

00:44:19.010 --> 00:44:22.540
and they've got the Styrofoam
female with this stuff there,

00:44:22.540 --> 00:44:24.892
and he's courting it
and having a great time.

00:44:24.892 --> 00:44:26.600
And now they put him
back there, and they

00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:27.840
do something or other there.

00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:31.310
And he comes out,
and the back feathers

00:44:31.310 --> 00:44:34.010
are kind of perpendicular
to the head.

00:44:34.010 --> 00:44:38.060
And that doesn't-- so you see
he sort of stops there and kind

00:44:38.060 --> 00:44:39.520
of circles around for a bit.

00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:41.540
But, being a male, he
decides what the hell

00:44:41.540 --> 00:44:43.260
and starts courting the thing.

00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:46.510
Then they put him back
in the room there.

00:44:46.510 --> 00:44:47.930
And now they let him out.

00:44:47.930 --> 00:44:51.230
And the tail and the head
are on the same side.

00:44:51.230 --> 00:44:53.340
He stands there, looking
a little more confused,

00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:55.640
before starting to
court the thing.

00:44:55.640 --> 00:45:00.220
Put him away, come back in,
and the head is over there,

00:45:00.220 --> 00:45:02.690
and the feathers are there,
and the Styrofoam ball.

00:45:02.690 --> 00:45:04.890
And you see he's kind
of like looking around

00:45:04.890 --> 00:45:08.180
and goes up to this and-- well,
that's not going to work--

00:45:08.180 --> 00:45:09.470
and goes over to the next one.

00:45:09.470 --> 00:45:12.180
And you're seeing what
the information-- can you

00:45:12.180 --> 00:45:13.880
believe how cruel this was?

00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:16.960
You could begin to see this
sort of information-- what

00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:20.810
were the building blocks of
that visual releasing stimulus--

00:45:20.810 --> 00:45:23.340
in order to find out about that.

00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:26.660
Then there is, not
surprisingly, a whole world

00:45:26.660 --> 00:45:29.210
of olfactory releasing stimuli.

00:45:29.210 --> 00:45:31.040
And we won't spend
any time on that

00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:33.170
here, because all
that stuff is going

00:45:33.170 --> 00:45:36.670
to come big time in the
lectures on sexual behavior--

00:45:36.670 --> 00:45:40.760
pheromones, information
that triggers behaviors,

00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:44.670
sexual behaviors in all sorts
of species, including humans.

00:45:44.670 --> 00:45:46.440
Olfactory information.

00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:47.910
One example with
humans, which was

00:45:47.910 --> 00:45:50.890
this very cool study that was
published a couple of months

00:45:50.890 --> 00:45:51.390
ago.

00:45:51.390 --> 00:45:56.480
What you need is sweat
from terrified people.

00:45:56.480 --> 00:45:57.550
So here's what you do.

00:45:57.550 --> 00:45:59.920
You throw somebody
out of an airplane

00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:02.212
who's never parachuted before.

00:46:02.212 --> 00:46:03.670
And the whole thing
is, I guess you

00:46:03.670 --> 00:46:07.220
can do your first jump in
tandem with the instructor who's

00:46:07.220 --> 00:46:09.950
attached to you and
who knows what to do.

00:46:09.950 --> 00:46:12.930
The instructor who's doing
all the physical work

00:46:12.930 --> 00:46:15.850
while you're just there attached
to them being scared out

00:46:15.850 --> 00:46:17.310
of your pants.

00:46:17.310 --> 00:46:20.270
Then you get a control
group-- a control group

00:46:20.270 --> 00:46:24.750
who, instead, have generated
stress sweat on an exercise

00:46:24.750 --> 00:46:25.580
bicycle.

00:46:25.580 --> 00:46:26.540
Totally fine.

00:46:26.540 --> 00:46:29.050
So quick, you get the guys
lying down in the field.

00:46:29.050 --> 00:46:30.190
They're hyperventilating.

00:46:30.190 --> 00:46:32.130
You run at them
with cotton swabs,

00:46:32.130 --> 00:46:35.110
and push his armpits into it,
and get some of his sweat,

00:46:35.110 --> 00:46:36.020
and seal it away.

00:46:36.020 --> 00:46:37.890
And then you get the
person on the bicycle,

00:46:37.890 --> 00:46:39.223
and you get some of their sweat.

00:46:39.223 --> 00:46:41.400
And now you sit
down people, and you

00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:45.560
let them smell the two sources.

00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:49.190
Objectively, people cannot
distinguish between them.

00:46:49.190 --> 00:46:51.770
Put the person in
a brain scanner,

00:46:51.770 --> 00:46:53.120
and give them the odors.

00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:55.820
And if they're smelling the
sweat from the terrified

00:46:55.820 --> 00:46:59.060
person, their
amygdala activates.

00:46:59.060 --> 00:47:02.250
Not if you smell the sweat
from the other individual.

00:47:02.250 --> 00:47:05.170
And not only that,
you now show them

00:47:05.170 --> 00:47:08.450
faces where the facial
expression is ambiguous.

00:47:08.450 --> 00:47:13.150
It's been sort of merged halfway
between a scared appearance

00:47:13.150 --> 00:47:15.740
and a happy one, between
different facial expressions.

00:47:15.740 --> 00:47:17.180
And you get somebody
after they've

00:47:17.180 --> 00:47:19.760
smelled the scared
sweat, and they interpret

00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:23.480
faces as more frightened.

00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:24.270
Whoa!

00:47:24.270 --> 00:47:25.310
Smells?

00:47:25.310 --> 00:47:28.290
The smells of people's armpits
and whether they were terrified

00:47:28.290 --> 00:47:31.050
or not changes how
your brain is working

00:47:31.050 --> 00:47:35.390
and changes how you judge
pictures of facial expressions.

00:47:35.390 --> 00:47:39.130
We've got stuff going on in
all sorts of sensory domains

00:47:39.130 --> 00:47:42.380
that we can't even
begin to guess at.

00:47:42.380 --> 00:47:45.920
Showing this even more, other
species where you go into stuff

00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:47.430
we don't even know about.

00:47:47.430 --> 00:47:49.190
Electric fish.

00:47:49.190 --> 00:47:53.320
You want to understand releasing
stimuli for electric fish,

00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:55.890
you've got to
understand electricity,

00:47:55.890 --> 00:48:00.020
and how they sing to each
other in electric fish songs,

00:48:00.020 --> 00:48:03.370
and how they-- where
is that coming from?

00:48:03.370 --> 00:48:06.160
Oh, right, they're singing
to each other in electricity.

00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:09.360
And, yes, you get
territorial songs.

00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:11.130
You get specific ones.

00:48:11.130 --> 00:48:14.690
You get males who are
courting the same female,

00:48:14.690 --> 00:48:17.670
trying to jam each
other's frequencies.

00:48:17.670 --> 00:48:20.320
This actually is
demonstrated quite readily.

00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:26.240
You see relatedness of frequency
patterns between siblings.

00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:28.660
They're going about
this with electricity.

00:48:28.660 --> 00:48:29.520
Whoa!

00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:31.370
What is happening
in the outside world

00:48:31.370 --> 00:48:33.810
there that we haven't
a clue at interviewing

00:48:33.810 --> 00:48:36.380
an animal in its own language?

00:48:36.380 --> 00:48:37.790
Vibration.

00:48:37.790 --> 00:48:41.880
All sorts of insects communicate
with each other by vibrating.

00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:45.239
Arachnids, there's all sorts of
things where they communicate--

00:48:45.239 --> 00:48:47.030
I don't know what they
want to talk about--

00:48:47.030 --> 00:48:48.760
but by vibrating a web.

00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:50.990
They can produce
distinctive patterns of it,

00:48:50.990 --> 00:48:52.560
which sends information.

00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:56.020
And oh, OK, weirdo insects
and spiders and stuff.

00:48:56.020 --> 00:48:59.120
Really interesting work
done in recent years,

00:48:59.120 --> 00:49:02.310
by somebody who used to be
here on campus named Caitlin

00:49:02.310 --> 00:49:06.090
O'Connell-Rodwell,
looking at elephants.

00:49:06.090 --> 00:49:09.100
And it turns out
elephants have all sorts

00:49:09.100 --> 00:49:12.900
of interesting pressure
transducer receptor

00:49:12.900 --> 00:49:17.490
little corpuscle
thingies in their feet.

00:49:17.490 --> 00:49:20.174
Nobody else has stuff like that
in their feet among mammals.

00:49:20.174 --> 00:49:21.840
These are things that
are supposed to be

00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:22.780
in other parts of the body.

00:49:22.780 --> 00:49:24.830
You don't see them at
the bottom of your feet.

00:49:24.830 --> 00:49:26.660
And what are these about?

00:49:26.660 --> 00:49:31.880
When an elephant walks,
it's causing tiny, tiny bits

00:49:31.880 --> 00:49:34.490
of vibration in the ground
that could be picked up

00:49:34.490 --> 00:49:36.640
hundreds of yards away.

00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:38.510
And what she has
shown experimentally

00:49:38.510 --> 00:49:42.750
is elephants can communicate
with each other with vibration

00:49:42.750 --> 00:49:43.820
through their feet.

00:49:43.820 --> 00:49:48.170
And she has done some brilliant
classical ethology studies

00:49:48.170 --> 00:49:51.680
of manipulating it and seeing if
you could change the elephant.

00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:54.220
They're talking to each
other with vibration.

00:49:54.220 --> 00:49:58.460
All of this very, very
different than we would guess.

00:49:58.460 --> 00:50:00.300
Tactile stimulation.

00:50:00.300 --> 00:50:03.950
And out of this came one of
the iconic experiments and one

00:50:03.950 --> 00:50:07.510
we will come back to lots
in lecturers to come.

00:50:07.510 --> 00:50:10.350
This one you've also seen
every single intro textbook

00:50:10.350 --> 00:50:13.920
out there, which is the
surrogate mother monkeys.

00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:16.740
You got the monkey who's
raised in social isolation,

00:50:16.740 --> 00:50:20.200
and all he's got are two
surrogate moms to choose from.

00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:23.970
And one has this
chicken wire tube torso

00:50:23.970 --> 00:50:26.800
thing with this little
unconvincing Styrofoam

00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:28.020
head put on top.

00:50:28.020 --> 00:50:32.540
And the other one is wrapped
in this nice, warm, terry cloth

00:50:32.540 --> 00:50:35.510
around its chicken wire
torso, with a head on top.

00:50:35.510 --> 00:50:36.700
What's the difference?

00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:38.810
The first one, the
chicken wire one,

00:50:38.810 --> 00:50:41.820
has a bottle of
milk sticking out.

00:50:41.820 --> 00:50:46.270
That one supplies milk,
supplies calories.

00:50:46.270 --> 00:50:49.410
This one supplies warmth.

00:50:49.410 --> 00:50:53.280
And in the mid-1950s, you
would ask somebody, well,

00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:55.880
why do babies like
their mothers?

00:50:55.880 --> 00:50:59.450
Because their mothers positively
reinforce them with milk,

00:50:59.450 --> 00:51:02.920
says BF Skinner, who clearly
knows endlessly about that.

00:51:02.920 --> 00:51:07.250
What is bonding between
mother and child about?

00:51:07.250 --> 00:51:11.950
It's about the mother meeting
the caloric and temperature

00:51:11.950 --> 00:51:13.630
needs of a child.

00:51:13.630 --> 00:51:16.430
By reinforcing the child
with milk now and then,

00:51:16.430 --> 00:51:18.050
the child becomes attached.

00:51:18.050 --> 00:51:20.900
And this is what
dominated in the field.

00:51:20.900 --> 00:51:21.450
OK.

00:51:21.450 --> 00:51:23.120
Nice, abstract question.

00:51:23.120 --> 00:51:26.920
Interesting realm where it
had an implication-- you take

00:51:26.920 --> 00:51:29.260
an infant, you take
a very young child,

00:51:29.260 --> 00:51:31.230
and you put him in
a pediatric ward

00:51:31.230 --> 00:51:34.020
for a couple of weeks
because of some illness.

00:51:34.020 --> 00:51:36.660
And what's the
philosophy at the time,

00:51:36.660 --> 00:51:39.370
derived from
hard-nosed behaviorism?

00:51:39.370 --> 00:51:43.260
It would say, dog equals
cat equals monkey.

00:51:43.260 --> 00:51:45.940
It would say, one person
with a bottle of milk

00:51:45.940 --> 00:51:48.220
equals another person
equals another.

00:51:48.220 --> 00:51:50.970
Parents, they don't
know the routines here.

00:51:50.970 --> 00:51:52.940
They never wash
their hands enough.

00:51:52.940 --> 00:51:55.610
So what we're going to do,
what was standard practice

00:51:55.610 --> 00:51:57.980
in pediatric wards
at the time, was

00:51:57.980 --> 00:52:01.440
parents were allowed to
visit 30 minutes a week.

00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:04.460
And otherwise, all of
the care was provided

00:52:04.460 --> 00:52:06.050
by people working there.

00:52:06.050 --> 00:52:08.850
And eventually,
the best thing ever

00:52:08.850 --> 00:52:11.880
came along that would make
any behaviorist delighted.

00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:14.740
You could do things with
infants, keeping them going,

00:52:14.740 --> 00:52:17.590
without even being
touched by human beings.

00:52:17.590 --> 00:52:21.490
Someone modified
chicken egg incubators

00:52:21.490 --> 00:52:23.820
and invented human incubators.

00:52:23.820 --> 00:52:26.700
And an entire just
grotesque literature

00:52:26.700 --> 00:52:30.340
shows the more incubators
a hospital had,

00:52:30.340 --> 00:52:33.770
the shorter the life
expectancy was of infants

00:52:33.770 --> 00:52:35.820
who came in in their ward.

00:52:35.820 --> 00:52:38.670
But that was the dominant
notion at the time.

00:52:38.670 --> 00:52:40.600
What do infants like about mom?

00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:42.070
She gets calories.

00:52:42.070 --> 00:52:43.070
She gives them calories.

00:52:43.070 --> 00:52:43.569
So OK.

00:52:43.569 --> 00:52:45.130
So you've got the
baby monkey there.

00:52:45.130 --> 00:52:48.340
And she's got two moms to choose
from-- the one that gives milk,

00:52:48.340 --> 00:52:51.740
and the one that has the terry
cloth with the tactile stuff.

00:52:51.740 --> 00:52:53.860
And which one is she
going to cling to?

00:52:53.860 --> 00:52:56.160
It's clear, if you had
BF Skinner in there,

00:52:56.160 --> 00:52:58.250
he'd be up there nursing
on the milk bottle

00:52:58.250 --> 00:52:59.630
within a couple of seconds.

00:52:59.630 --> 00:53:01.650
But what does the
baby do instead?

00:53:01.650 --> 00:53:03.400
Which one does it bond to?

00:53:03.400 --> 00:53:06.290
The warm, terrycloth mother.

00:53:06.290 --> 00:53:07.200
Ah.

00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:10.680
Love has so much more to
do than just calories,

00:53:10.680 --> 00:53:14.620
and adequate clothing, and a
vaccine every now and then.

00:53:14.620 --> 00:53:17.700
This was a study by a man
named Harry Harlow which

00:53:17.700 --> 00:53:21.320
transformed-- began to get
people to think utterly

00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:23.970
differently about the
nature of bonding.

00:53:23.970 --> 00:53:26.720
We will hear tons about
that work down the line.

00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:28.910
So tactile stuff.

00:53:28.910 --> 00:53:33.280
Finally, what is the realm of
the most brilliant combination

00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:36.790
of various releasing stimuli
triggering fixed action

00:53:36.790 --> 00:53:38.680
patterns out the wazoo?

00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:42.140
What baby animals look
like in every species

00:53:42.140 --> 00:53:44.820
out there short of
crocodiles and snakes.

00:53:44.820 --> 00:53:47.450
All the baby animals and
all the different species

00:53:47.450 --> 00:53:50.320
have the little short
muzzles, and the big round

00:53:50.320 --> 00:53:52.200
eyes, and the big
shiny forehead,

00:53:52.200 --> 00:53:54.500
and the big ears
sticking out there,

00:53:54.500 --> 00:53:56.910
and maybe a
distinctive coloration

00:53:56.910 --> 00:54:00.620
that sets them off different
from mom, from adults.

00:54:00.620 --> 00:54:06.130
And every species, you take some
incredibly cute baby monkey,

00:54:06.130 --> 00:54:10.910
and polar bears are going
to say, oh, look how cute!

00:54:10.910 --> 00:54:13.650
And their eyes are going
to dilate, their pupils,

00:54:13.650 --> 00:54:17.450
and you are going to
elicit cute responses.

00:54:17.450 --> 00:54:19.950
The term, this set of
fixed action patterns

00:54:19.950 --> 00:54:22.350
that people and all
sorts of species

00:54:22.350 --> 00:54:27.380
do in response to the releasing
stimuli of a cute baby.

00:54:27.380 --> 00:54:30.600
And, I kid you not,
the early generations

00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:33.850
of Disney illustrators
studied this.

00:54:33.850 --> 00:54:37.460
They studied what it is
that makes baby faces baby.

00:54:37.460 --> 00:54:41.780
And an amazing paper, classic
one by Stephen Jay Gould,

00:54:41.780 --> 00:54:45.790
talking about Mickey Mouse,
the evolution of Mickey Mouse.

00:54:45.790 --> 00:54:48.310
If you go back to when
Mickey Mouse started off

00:54:48.310 --> 00:54:50.110
in, I don't know,
the 1920s or so,

00:54:50.110 --> 00:54:51.940
his name was Steamboat Willie.

00:54:51.940 --> 00:54:53.830
And he was this rat.

00:54:53.830 --> 00:54:58.240
He was this like skinny,
angular, ectomorph rat

00:54:58.240 --> 00:55:00.080
thing with five fingers.

00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:04.890
And he was basically sort of
this double entendre-ing sort

00:55:04.890 --> 00:55:08.920
of mildly sexual
aggressive beast, who

00:55:08.920 --> 00:55:11.020
was always ripping people off.

00:55:11.020 --> 00:55:15.570
And somehow he turned
from that into our Mickey,

00:55:15.570 --> 00:55:17.140
who delights people.

00:55:17.140 --> 00:55:19.840
And what Gould showed
was-- in this paper,

00:55:19.840 --> 00:55:24.120
he actually showed the evolution
of Mickey Mouse's muzzle

00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:26.910
as over the decades, showing
how it was getting smaller,

00:55:26.910 --> 00:55:28.790
and the ratio of the
forehead to this.

00:55:28.790 --> 00:55:31.887
And somewhere along the way,
Mickey lost one of his fingers.

00:55:31.887 --> 00:55:33.470
And somewhere along
the way, his voice

00:55:33.470 --> 00:55:36.790
got real prepubescent,
which it wasn't early on.

00:55:36.790 --> 00:55:40.960
And suddenly, the oh so chased
mysterious Minnie shows up,

00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:42.740
and all they ever do
is sing and dance.

00:55:42.740 --> 00:55:46.300
And this is an amazing paper
on how the Disney artists

00:55:46.300 --> 00:55:50.040
eventually learned what is
it about baby animals that

00:55:50.040 --> 00:55:52.910
makes everybody want
to be around them.

00:55:52.910 --> 00:55:56.000
So we see here the
releasing stimuli.

00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:59.620
Next thing, after the break,
what's going on in the head

00:55:59.620 --> 00:56:01.890
in between the
releasing stimulus,

00:56:01.890 --> 00:56:04.260
and out comes the
fixed action pattern.

00:56:04.260 --> 00:56:04.760
OK.

00:56:04.760 --> 00:56:06.890
So five minutes.

00:56:06.890 --> 00:56:08.370
Two great questions.

00:56:08.370 --> 00:56:12.030
The first one, going back
to Niko Tinbergen's attempts

00:56:12.030 --> 00:56:15.240
to get baby gulls eaten--
that whole business

00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:16.940
about flipping the
eggshells over.

00:56:16.940 --> 00:56:21.210
Somebody asking, so why
haven't eggs and birds

00:56:21.210 --> 00:56:23.860
and stuff evolved so that
the inside of the egg shell

00:56:23.860 --> 00:56:25.340
is speckled also?

00:56:25.340 --> 00:56:27.280
And the answer is,
I haven't a clue.

00:56:27.280 --> 00:56:28.611
Does anybody know why?

00:56:28.611 --> 00:56:30.860
Is there some good reason
why the inside of egg shells

00:56:30.860 --> 00:56:31.670
have to be white?

00:56:34.630 --> 00:56:41.990
Calcium or-- well, there's
got to be some good reason.

00:56:41.990 --> 00:56:43.650
But you go out and test that.

00:56:43.650 --> 00:56:44.150
OK.

00:56:44.150 --> 00:56:47.400
So that would have been
an interesting study.

00:56:47.400 --> 00:56:48.320
I have no idea why.

00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:50.470
The other one, of
the same sort of bent

00:56:50.470 --> 00:56:53.760
of the, how do they figure this
out-- how do they figure out

00:56:53.760 --> 00:56:58.400
that human males can detect,
like the sound of women's

00:56:58.400 --> 00:57:02.320
voices when they rise around
the time of ovulation?

00:57:02.320 --> 00:57:04.290
What you do is
you record voices,

00:57:04.290 --> 00:57:07.440
and then you manipulate
the pitch that it's at.

00:57:07.440 --> 00:57:09.620
And this is a very
subtle effect,

00:57:09.620 --> 00:57:11.110
but people listen to it.

00:57:11.110 --> 00:57:14.390
And if they're men and they
listen to it, on the average,

00:57:14.390 --> 00:57:17.840
they will rate the voices that
are a little bit higher as more

00:57:17.840 --> 00:57:18.760
appealing.

00:57:18.760 --> 00:57:22.310
We will hear plenty about
stuff like that down the line.

00:57:22.310 --> 00:57:22.910
OK.

00:57:22.910 --> 00:57:24.230
So what do we got so far?

00:57:24.230 --> 00:57:27.450
We have looked at interviewing
an animal in its own language

00:57:27.450 --> 00:57:29.900
and asking what the behavior
is about-- the effect

00:57:29.900 --> 00:57:31.720
of experience on the behavior.

00:57:31.720 --> 00:57:35.570
Looking at what's going on
in terms of adaptive value

00:57:35.570 --> 00:57:38.180
in a totally different way
than the evolutionary folks

00:57:38.180 --> 00:57:39.430
would be looking at.

00:57:39.430 --> 00:57:43.080
Looking at what-- in the outside
world, what releasing stimulus

00:57:43.080 --> 00:57:44.290
triggered the behavior.

00:57:44.290 --> 00:57:49.090
Huge take home message there
being animals, including us,

00:57:49.090 --> 00:57:52.380
are communicating
information in sensory realms

00:57:52.380 --> 00:57:55.170
we could never even
guess at-- interviewing

00:57:55.170 --> 00:57:56.390
in its own language.

00:57:56.390 --> 00:57:58.490
And also, along the
way there, training

00:57:58.490 --> 00:58:01.760
ethologists to come up with
really clever, cool, elegant

00:58:01.760 --> 00:58:02.910
experiments.

00:58:02.910 --> 00:58:04.070
So the next step.

00:58:04.070 --> 00:58:06.360
What's going on
here between when

00:58:06.360 --> 00:58:09.890
the releasing stimulus happens,
and out pops the behavior

00:58:09.890 --> 00:58:11.390
from the other side?

00:58:11.390 --> 00:58:15.640
Old ethology jargon-- what is
the innate releasing mechanism?

00:58:15.640 --> 00:58:18.280
Which is like this really
unfortunate phrase.

00:58:18.280 --> 00:58:19.714
But what's going on inside?

00:58:19.714 --> 00:58:21.130
And it was right
around this point

00:58:21.130 --> 00:58:23.750
that all the classical
ethologists would say,

00:58:23.750 --> 00:58:24.840
we don't know!

00:58:24.840 --> 00:58:27.040
It's obviously
important, but we're not

00:58:27.040 --> 00:58:28.660
able to understand it.

00:58:28.660 --> 00:58:30.440
And that has changed now.

00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:34.590
And what that field is
called is neuroethology.

00:58:34.590 --> 00:58:36.890
And that is the hottest
part of the field

00:58:36.890 --> 00:58:40.280
in the last few decades,
trying to understand what's

00:58:40.280 --> 00:58:44.740
going on in the brain that
turns certain releasing stimuli

00:58:44.740 --> 00:58:47.550
into behaviors
out the other end.

00:58:47.550 --> 00:58:50.490
And there have been
some amazing successes

00:58:50.490 --> 00:58:52.529
in this realm in
terms of working out

00:58:52.529 --> 00:58:53.570
the nuts and bolts of it.

00:58:53.570 --> 00:58:55.720
One example, the
one that's probably

00:58:55.720 --> 00:58:58.590
the most studied,
which is understanding

00:58:58.590 --> 00:59:01.960
the neurobiology of birdsong.

00:59:01.960 --> 00:59:05.950
Bird song-- how does a
bird learn its species

00:59:05.950 --> 00:59:07.060
specific song?

00:59:07.060 --> 00:59:09.510
How does a bird learn
one that winds up

00:59:09.510 --> 00:59:11.660
being distinctive for itself?

00:59:11.660 --> 00:59:14.800
What happens to birds
that have to come up

00:59:14.800 --> 00:59:17.340
with a new song every
year, because they're

00:59:17.340 --> 00:59:20.230
seasonal breeders in a way
where they're migrating around?

00:59:20.230 --> 00:59:21.490
How do they learn that?

00:59:21.490 --> 00:59:25.540
What sort of sensory stimulation
do they need from around them?

00:59:25.540 --> 00:59:28.220
If you raise a bird
in complete isolation,

00:59:28.220 --> 00:59:30.080
does it come up
with a song which is

00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:32.240
exactly what its species does?

00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:34.920
No, but it's kind
of close to it.

00:59:34.920 --> 00:59:37.200
It needs experience to shape it.

00:59:37.200 --> 00:59:40.550
What's going on in bird
species like [INAUDIBLE] birds

00:59:40.550 --> 00:59:43.610
that imitate the
sounds of other birds?

00:59:43.610 --> 00:59:46.220
And people have been
dissecting this down

00:59:46.220 --> 00:59:49.890
to the individual neurons
for years, understanding

00:59:49.890 --> 00:59:52.300
what's going on in between.

00:59:52.300 --> 00:59:55.470
Another domain that seems
far more inexplicable for why

00:59:55.470 --> 00:59:57.470
people would want to
spend decades on it

00:59:57.470 --> 00:59:59.200
is-- for people
who took Bio core,

00:59:59.200 --> 01:00:01.240
I always go over
this one-- a reflex.

01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:04.780
A reflex you find
in female hamsters.

01:00:04.780 --> 01:00:07.170
Which is you get
a female hamster,

01:00:07.170 --> 01:00:11.940
and you put pressure, tactile
pressure, on her rear end.

01:00:11.940 --> 01:00:14.550
And what she will
do is arch her back

01:00:14.550 --> 01:00:18.770
at that point and produce what
is called a lordosis reflex.

01:00:18.770 --> 01:00:20.150
So what's that about?

01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:22.530
It's obviously a
fixed action pattern.

01:00:22.530 --> 01:00:24.370
Let's ask an adaptive question.

01:00:24.370 --> 01:00:27.350
What's the advantage of
having a lordosis reflex?

01:00:27.350 --> 01:00:30.190
What it does is, by
arching up that way,

01:00:30.190 --> 01:00:32.670
it exposes the
female's genitals,

01:00:32.670 --> 01:00:36.310
making it easier for
a male to mount her.

01:00:36.310 --> 01:00:39.020
Well, when is that
useful for the female?

01:00:39.020 --> 01:00:40.800
If she's ovulating.

01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:45.460
You only get this reflex when
estrogen levels are elevated.

01:00:45.460 --> 01:00:48.550
And adaptive value of
that built around the fact

01:00:48.550 --> 01:00:50.530
that most things
that are pressing

01:00:50.530 --> 01:00:52.650
on the rear end
of female hamsters

01:00:52.650 --> 01:00:55.740
are not grad students trying
to get their degree eventually.

01:00:55.740 --> 01:00:59.010
[INAUDIBLE] ethologically
relevant context,

01:00:59.010 --> 01:01:01.440
that's part of the mating
courtship display stuff.

01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:06.200
And there is a guy I know who is
the king-- the king of pressing

01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:08.280
on the rear end of
female hamsters.

01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:10.560
People will not be able
to talk about the behavior

01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:13.410
for centuries to come
without his name being

01:01:13.410 --> 01:01:14.660
sung about there.

01:01:14.660 --> 01:01:16.860
And he and his
lab have gotten it

01:01:16.860 --> 01:01:21.180
down to individual neurons
in the whole reflex pathway,

01:01:21.180 --> 01:01:23.790
and which neurons are
affected by estrogen,

01:01:23.790 --> 01:01:27.830
and how exactly it
works-- neuroethology.

01:01:27.830 --> 01:01:30.530
Another realm of it,
of neuroethology,

01:01:30.530 --> 01:01:32.590
is one done with
humans these days--

01:01:32.590 --> 01:01:36.290
taking advantage of brain
scanning techniques, and seeing

01:01:36.290 --> 01:01:40.630
what sort of subliminal sensory
information you give someone,

01:01:40.630 --> 01:01:42.800
and what parts of
the brain change

01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:44.400
their levels of activity.

01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:47.110
And the scared sweat versus
the neutral sweat study

01:01:47.110 --> 01:01:50.250
is a perfect example
of that, and we

01:01:50.250 --> 01:01:53.050
will hear plenty of those
in the lectures to come.

01:01:53.050 --> 01:01:55.560
As neuroethology
really took off,

01:01:55.560 --> 01:01:58.160
an additional
elaboration happened,

01:01:58.160 --> 01:02:02.390
which is people began to
try doing neuroethology out

01:02:02.390 --> 01:02:05.350
in the field with animals
in their real habitat.

01:02:05.350 --> 01:02:07.170
Because all the ones
I just described

01:02:07.170 --> 01:02:08.870
were the laboratory
animals trying

01:02:08.870 --> 01:02:10.700
to do it out in the
field, and there's

01:02:10.700 --> 01:02:12.670
been a number of approaches.

01:02:12.670 --> 01:02:15.840
One is, people-- a guy
named John Wingfield used

01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:17.610
to be at the University
of Washington.

01:02:17.610 --> 01:02:21.060
John Wingfield studies birds.

01:02:21.060 --> 01:02:23.660
And I have no idea if he ever
actually wanted to study birds

01:02:23.660 --> 01:02:25.930
or if he was fated to
do this from the start.

01:02:25.930 --> 01:02:30.280
But what he does is, he studies
the physiology and the behavior

01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:32.980
of bird species that
migrate from Baja

01:02:32.980 --> 01:02:36.670
up to the Arctic each
year and back again.

01:02:36.670 --> 01:02:41.140
Bird species where what happens
with their migratory behavior,

01:02:41.140 --> 01:02:44.090
if there's an extra
freeze that's unexpected,

01:02:44.090 --> 01:02:47.340
if spring comes earlier,
what are the-- and he

01:02:47.340 --> 01:02:48.490
traps these birds.

01:02:48.490 --> 01:02:51.670
He nets them, and he's got
like electrodes in their heads,

01:02:51.670 --> 01:02:55.280
and lets them go to fly off to
Alaska, recording from there.

01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:58.700
And this is neuroethology
stuff-- figuring out

01:02:58.700 --> 01:03:02.380
the circuitry going on
precisely with that, with birds

01:03:02.380 --> 01:03:04.592
in their natural setting.

01:03:04.592 --> 01:03:06.550
Another example, which
is some of the work I've

01:03:06.550 --> 01:03:09.240
done over the years, which
is studying baboons out

01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:12.860
in their natural habitat
and trying to do ethology,

01:03:12.860 --> 01:03:15.250
neuroethology stuff, out there.

01:03:15.250 --> 01:03:17.650
What, for example,
does your personality--

01:03:17.650 --> 01:03:20.170
if you were a baboon--
have to do with the brain

01:03:20.170 --> 01:03:22.360
chemistry of anxiety in you?

01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:24.750
You remember the stuff
by now, benzodiazepines

01:03:24.750 --> 01:03:27.170
and the benzodiazepine
receptors.

01:03:27.170 --> 01:03:30.150
Are there personality
related differences

01:03:30.150 --> 01:03:32.950
in the brain chemistry of
benzodiazepines in baboons

01:03:32.950 --> 01:03:33.450
out there.

01:03:33.450 --> 01:03:35.450
And you can squeeze
out a surprising amount

01:03:35.450 --> 01:03:36.470
of information.

01:03:36.470 --> 01:03:39.410
All of this is part
of the transition

01:03:39.410 --> 01:03:41.200
back when of saying,
well, something

01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:43.650
has to be going on
in between there.

01:03:43.650 --> 01:03:46.440
You're a behaviorist,
and you say, who cares?

01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:48.275
You're an ethologist,
and you would say,

01:03:48.275 --> 01:03:49.900
wouldn't it be great
that someday we're

01:03:49.900 --> 01:03:51.290
going to be able to study it?

01:03:51.290 --> 01:03:53.760
And what the neuroethologist
actually can do

01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:56.490
is study it and
begin to work out

01:03:56.490 --> 01:04:01.030
circuitry maps and all of
that, what's going on inside.

01:04:01.030 --> 01:04:04.760
Interviewing the brain of an
animal in its own language.

01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:07.320
Because-- as you will see
in some of the anatomy,

01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:09.880
neuroanatomy lectures
to come-- you're not

01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:12.960
going to make any sense about
which parts of the brain

01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:15.350
are big, and send
projections to which

01:04:15.350 --> 01:04:17.540
other parts, until
you know something

01:04:17.540 --> 01:04:19.520
about the behavior
of that species

01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:23.220
and what sort of sensory
systems it pays attention to.

01:04:23.220 --> 01:04:23.720
OK.

01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:25.280
So these are sort
of the big pieces

01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:26.670
of the ethological approach.

01:04:26.670 --> 01:04:27.900
What's the behavior?

01:04:27.900 --> 01:04:28.930
What triggered it?

01:04:28.930 --> 01:04:32.720
What are the intervening
neuro endo steps in there?

01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:34.290
What's the adaptive value?

01:04:34.290 --> 01:04:38.300
What was also the final piece
of the ethological approach was,

01:04:38.300 --> 01:04:40.470
what does learning have
to do with all of this?

01:04:40.470 --> 01:04:43.260
We already know that
learning is relevant in terms

01:04:43.260 --> 01:04:44.980
of those fixed action patterns.

01:04:44.980 --> 01:04:48.930
But exploring learning in
all sorts of additional ways.

01:04:48.930 --> 01:04:52.410
And the ethological
contribution to that field

01:04:52.410 --> 01:04:54.140
is basically twofold.

01:04:54.140 --> 01:04:57.700
The first would be
boring, classical,

01:04:57.700 --> 01:04:59.900
sort of behaviorist
type learning

01:04:59.900 --> 01:05:03.420
paradigms that behaviorists
had explained centuries before.

01:05:03.420 --> 01:05:07.860
What was interesting, showing it
in domains of animal behavior,

01:05:07.860 --> 01:05:09.670
where everybody else
would have said,

01:05:09.670 --> 01:05:11.800
they have to learn
how to do that?

01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:13.300
That's not an instinct?

01:05:13.300 --> 01:05:16.260
Showing realms of
traditional learning

01:05:16.260 --> 01:05:18.140
that were very unexpected.

01:05:18.140 --> 01:05:20.600
The second piece
was showing types

01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:24.340
of learning that break every
rule about how learning

01:05:24.340 --> 01:05:26.300
works if you're a behaviorist.

01:05:26.300 --> 01:05:26.980
OK.

01:05:26.980 --> 01:05:30.610
So what would be a standard
example of normal learning?

01:05:30.610 --> 01:05:33.250
You get reinforced, you're
more likely to do something.

01:05:33.250 --> 01:05:34.830
You get punished,
you're less likely.

01:05:34.830 --> 01:05:36.380
The whole song and dance there.

01:05:36.380 --> 01:05:39.490
Where does just plain old
normal learning-- learning

01:05:39.490 --> 01:05:42.150
from trial and error--
come in in places

01:05:42.150 --> 01:05:43.790
that one would not expect?

01:05:43.790 --> 01:05:48.310
If you are a female monkey,
it is not instinctual

01:05:48.310 --> 01:05:51.850
for you to know what you're
doing with your first baby.

01:05:51.850 --> 01:05:55.195
Maternal competence is
not a strong instinct.

01:05:55.195 --> 01:05:58.220
It does not produce a
bunch of fixed action

01:05:58.220 --> 01:06:01.540
patterns in, for example,
female rhesus monkeys.

01:06:01.540 --> 01:06:03.770
They have to learn how to do it.

01:06:03.770 --> 01:06:05.840
They have to learn how
to hold on to the kid

01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:07.700
when they're jumping
up in a tree.

01:06:07.700 --> 01:06:10.910
They have to learn which end you
try to stick on to the nipple.

01:06:10.910 --> 01:06:13.090
You have to learn all
sorts of stuff like that.

01:06:13.090 --> 01:06:13.880
Weird.

01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:16.540
All of my kids starved to
death, but then today I

01:06:16.540 --> 01:06:18.770
tried switching this
one around this way.

01:06:18.770 --> 01:06:20.180
Isn't that cool?

01:06:20.180 --> 01:06:22.660
Anybody know Niko
Tinbergen's email address?

01:06:22.660 --> 01:06:24.530
What you wind up
seeing there is they

01:06:24.530 --> 01:06:26.840
have to learn how to do it.

01:06:26.840 --> 01:06:29.560
So what sort of
evidence would you see?

01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:34.580
For example, you have mothers
having a higher likelihood

01:06:34.580 --> 01:06:38.060
of their kids surviving as you
go from their first offspring

01:06:38.060 --> 01:06:39.500
to later ones.

01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:40.490
OK.

01:06:40.490 --> 01:06:42.620
But maybe you can
come up with all sorts

01:06:42.620 --> 01:06:44.530
of other things going on there.

01:06:44.530 --> 01:06:47.210
What else do researchers find?

01:06:47.210 --> 01:06:51.960
If you have a big sister,
and you are a female rhesus

01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:54.400
monkey-- or a female baboon,
it's been shown as well.

01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:58.030
If you have a big sister
who has a baby, when

01:06:58.030 --> 01:07:00.230
you have your first
baby, your child

01:07:00.230 --> 01:07:02.270
is more likely to survive.

01:07:02.270 --> 01:07:03.500
How come?

01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:05.870
Because you watched her.

01:07:05.870 --> 01:07:08.180
You watched your
big sister doing it.

01:07:08.180 --> 01:07:12.770
Or if your mother had another
sister, another daughter,

01:07:12.770 --> 01:07:16.140
and you got to-- no, another
child of either sex--

01:07:16.140 --> 01:07:18.470
and you got to watch,
what was even more

01:07:18.470 --> 01:07:21.960
clear in the literature was
the more experience you had

01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:25.700
actually holding on to
your niece or nephew there,

01:07:25.700 --> 01:07:27.650
the more-- as
termed in the field

01:07:27.650 --> 01:07:31.360
now-- the more [INAUDIBLE]
behavior that you had,

01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:34.370
the more likely your first
child was to survive.

01:07:34.370 --> 01:07:37.980
Because you were learning
how to be a competent mother

01:07:37.980 --> 01:07:39.750
as a primate, as a monkey.

01:07:39.750 --> 01:07:41.640
It's not, oh, instinctual.

01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:42.930
They just know how to do it.

01:07:42.930 --> 01:07:44.650
It's all hardwired somehow.

01:07:44.650 --> 01:07:47.410
This is a realm where
you have to learn.

01:07:47.410 --> 01:07:49.185
Another domain
where this happens,

01:07:49.185 --> 01:07:51.920
and another one where what
you would immediately say is,

01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:55.430
wait, they didn't do this just
by reflex or instinctually?

01:07:55.430 --> 01:08:00.300
Meerkats-- meerkats who eat
all sorts of unlikely things.

01:08:00.300 --> 01:08:02.730
And one of the things
they eat are scorpions.

01:08:02.730 --> 01:08:07.270
And mom meerkats have to
teach the kids how to hunt

01:08:07.270 --> 01:08:10.030
and eat scorpions without
getting yourself in trouble

01:08:10.030 --> 01:08:10.530
there.

01:08:10.530 --> 01:08:13.650
What is shown-- like
teaching techniques,

01:08:13.650 --> 01:08:17.060
they would be teaching three
blocks away in the Ed school,

01:08:17.060 --> 01:08:20.790
in terms of progressively
making the task harder

01:08:20.790 --> 01:08:22.279
in small increments.

01:08:22.279 --> 01:08:23.359
What happens?

01:08:23.359 --> 01:08:26.420
The meerkat mom goes
and kills a scorpion.

01:08:26.420 --> 01:08:28.200
And for the first
couple of days,

01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:32.680
the baby learns how to eat a
scorpion that's already dead.

01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:35.300
Then, once the kid has
that under control,

01:08:35.300 --> 01:08:37.850
the mom goes and
captures a scorpion.

01:08:37.850 --> 01:08:42.689
Which remains alive, but mom is
able to bite off the stinger,

01:08:42.689 --> 01:08:46.490
and now leaves the kid
with this live scorpion

01:08:46.490 --> 01:08:49.810
that it can learn how to
hunt, and learn how to kill,

01:08:49.810 --> 01:08:50.939
and get food.

01:08:50.939 --> 01:08:52.680
And only when
they're doing that,

01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:56.410
then mom captures a live
scorpion with the stinger

01:08:56.410 --> 01:08:58.970
still on and plops
it down for the kid.

01:08:58.970 --> 01:09:00.988
This is exactly what
they teach you to do

01:09:00.988 --> 01:09:02.279
if you're being a good teacher.

01:09:02.279 --> 01:09:04.910
Which is a nice, small,
incremental steps.

01:09:04.910 --> 01:09:07.170
You don't want to do the
same thing for too long.

01:09:07.170 --> 01:09:08.273
The kid gets bored.

01:09:08.273 --> 01:09:09.939
You don't want to
have too big of steps.

01:09:09.939 --> 01:09:11.210
They get learned helpless.

01:09:11.210 --> 01:09:13.970
And you just-- they're teaching
their kids how to hunt,

01:09:13.970 --> 01:09:16.460
because the kids don't
know how to do it.

01:09:16.460 --> 01:09:19.279
Perfectly clear example
of classical learning,

01:09:19.279 --> 01:09:23.520
but in a domain where nobody
thought it would be going on.

01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:25.689
Another example of
it-- and this is

01:09:25.689 --> 01:09:29.979
one where the behavior itself
was so unlikely that nobody

01:09:29.979 --> 01:09:33.109
would ever have been saying, oh,
animals just know instinctually

01:09:33.109 --> 01:09:34.830
how to do this,
because nobody believed

01:09:34.830 --> 01:09:39.670
this behavior could occur--
which is animals making tools.

01:09:39.670 --> 01:09:42.330
This has been shown in a
number of species, including,

01:09:42.330 --> 01:09:43.859
for example, cetaceans.

01:09:43.859 --> 01:09:46.960
Where it's been best
studied is in apes.

01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:47.990
Other ape species.

01:09:47.990 --> 01:09:49.439
Actually, we make tools, too.

01:09:49.439 --> 01:09:51.130
So all of the ape species.

01:09:51.130 --> 01:09:54.660
And Jane Goodall, pioneer
of chimp research,

01:09:54.660 --> 01:09:57.390
was the first one to
discover this-- chimps being

01:09:57.390 --> 01:10:00.490
able to strip the little bark
and stuff off of a long twig

01:10:00.490 --> 01:10:02.660
and insert it into
a termite mound

01:10:02.660 --> 01:10:04.245
and pull it up with
all the termites

01:10:04.245 --> 01:10:06.640
that grabbed onto the stick
when it was down there.

01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:08.640
And now being able
to eat the termites.

01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:13.150
And chimps, various types of
populations of chimps, they

01:10:13.150 --> 01:10:16.500
use tools to hammer,
to break open nuts.

01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:18.750
They know how to use
a hammer and anvil.

01:10:18.750 --> 01:10:21.655
They get a flat rock, and
they do this with this.

01:10:21.655 --> 01:10:24.640
All sorts of tool
making and tool using.

01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:27.460
As we will hear, there is
at least one population

01:10:27.460 --> 01:10:30.790
of chimps that has been studied
where males will actually

01:10:30.790 --> 01:10:35.850
fashion large pieces of wood--
Where they will work to modify

01:10:35.850 --> 01:10:37.680
it, to use it as a weapon.

01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:40.650
They can build tools
that are weapons.

01:10:40.650 --> 01:10:42.060
So what's going on with that?

01:10:42.060 --> 01:10:46.150
And all sorts of studies
showing, for example, the more

01:10:46.150 --> 01:10:49.060
experience you have sitting
and watching somebody else

01:10:49.060 --> 01:10:52.890
make these things, the faster
you're going to master it.

01:10:52.890 --> 01:10:55.870
But you actually want
hands on practice.

01:10:55.870 --> 01:10:58.440
The more the individual,
the other chimp,

01:10:58.440 --> 01:11:00.180
gives you the
building blocks of it

01:11:00.180 --> 01:11:02.580
to start doing the
piece and all of that,

01:11:02.580 --> 01:11:07.320
and you begin to master
it learning by experience.

01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:09.610
One thing that is
very amusing is

01:11:09.610 --> 01:11:13.220
that it has been shown
that chimps, the daughters

01:11:13.220 --> 01:11:15.630
learn much, much
faster than the sons.

01:11:15.630 --> 01:11:17.850
Because the sons don't
pay attention to mom

01:11:17.850 --> 01:11:19.940
when she's sitting there
and trying to get them

01:11:19.940 --> 01:11:21.140
with their hands to do this.

01:11:21.140 --> 01:11:23.130
The daughters are
much more attentive.

01:11:23.130 --> 01:11:27.560
What you also see is, the larger
the social group, the earlier

01:11:27.560 --> 01:11:30.250
in life the kids
learn the tool use.

01:11:30.250 --> 01:11:33.960
And this is brilliant
ape behavior,

01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:35.710
brilliant ape learning.

01:11:35.710 --> 01:11:37.320
Monkeys don't do this.

01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:40.810
I have seen baboons--
films of them, actually.

01:11:40.810 --> 01:11:43.590
I have seen baboons on films
where they are watching

01:11:43.590 --> 01:11:45.550
these chimps doing the
thing with the stick

01:11:45.550 --> 01:11:47.610
there, and going down,
and out come the termites.

01:11:47.610 --> 01:11:48.850
And do it again and again.

01:11:48.850 --> 01:11:52.160
And finally, the chimp is just
gorged with all the termites

01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:53.890
and staggers off for a nap.

01:11:53.890 --> 01:11:57.580
And the baboon comes over
and will pick up the stick

01:11:57.580 --> 01:12:00.790
and shake it at
the termite mound

01:12:00.790 --> 01:12:02.650
or push it against
the side of it.

01:12:02.650 --> 01:12:04.750
Monkeys can't do this.

01:12:04.750 --> 01:12:07.510
Apes can, but they don't
do it instinctually.

01:12:07.510 --> 01:12:09.740
They gotta learn how to do this.

01:12:09.740 --> 01:12:15.180
So another domain of learning--
learning purely of the,

01:12:15.180 --> 01:12:17.340
we know how this
works, we just didn't

01:12:17.340 --> 01:12:19.970
think it would be
going on in this realm.

01:12:19.970 --> 01:12:22.220
But then, what
ethology has been most

01:12:22.220 --> 01:12:26.320
amazing at is showing types
of learning that are simply

01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:31.150
unexpected, that break all the
classic rules of reinforcement

01:12:31.150 --> 01:12:32.020
theory.

01:12:32.020 --> 01:12:33.490
One example.

01:12:33.490 --> 01:12:38.140
One example of it is what is
now called one trial learning.

01:12:38.140 --> 01:12:40.170
Which is another
term that I think

01:12:40.170 --> 01:12:41.670
I used the other
day, the one that's

01:12:41.670 --> 01:12:44.510
sort of more-- sort of a classic
that everybody learned back

01:12:44.510 --> 01:12:50.160
when, that animals will
imprint on something after one

01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:52.560
round of exposure to it.

01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:56.610
And the classic example
would be Konrad Lorenz

01:12:56.610 --> 01:12:58.360
and his famous little duckies.

01:12:58.360 --> 01:13:01.770
That when birds come out, there
is a short period after which

01:13:01.770 --> 01:13:06.450
where they imprint on any
big thing moving around,

01:13:06.450 --> 01:13:08.640
on a fairly safe assumption
that, in most cases,

01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:10.710
that big thing is
going to be mom.

01:13:10.710 --> 01:13:13.320
That's how they bond to mom.

01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:15.580
There is a short
window, what is now

01:13:15.580 --> 01:13:18.960
known as a critical period,
where the bonding goes on

01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:20.010
during that time.

01:13:20.010 --> 01:13:23.270
And whatever big thing is
moving around-- and eventually,

01:13:23.270 --> 01:13:26.170
people were doing
classic ethology studies

01:13:26.170 --> 01:13:29.280
with subtraction and
substitution of stimuli

01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:32.030
and running around with
like a stuffed Big Bird.

01:13:32.030 --> 01:13:34.350
And they imprint on
that, and all sorts

01:13:34.350 --> 01:13:37.900
of large mobile objects--
basically anything that moves.

01:13:37.900 --> 01:13:41.710
And that's where you would get
all the little duckies, goose

01:13:41.710 --> 01:13:45.270
stepping behind Konrad Lorenz
when they had imprinted on him.

01:13:45.270 --> 01:13:48.530
And this is not by
trial and error.

01:13:48.530 --> 01:13:51.270
Oh, I initially got
bonded to this thing

01:13:51.270 --> 01:13:53.160
with sharp teeth and claws.

01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:55.230
And that was kind of a bummer.

01:13:55.230 --> 01:13:57.230
That involved all
sorts of blood loss.

01:13:57.230 --> 01:13:59.750
So I've learned, don't
bond to that sort of thing.

01:13:59.750 --> 01:14:04.220
Well, then I tried bonding to,
are you my mother bulldozers?

01:14:04.220 --> 01:14:06.400
And then I tried
bonding to this.

01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:09.179
And, oh, eventually you
figure out your mother

01:14:09.179 --> 01:14:10.720
is the one you should
be hanging out.

01:14:10.720 --> 01:14:11.340
No.

01:14:11.340 --> 01:14:15.000
This is not a domain where you
can learn by trial and error.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.440
And what is seen instead
is this phenomenon

01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:19.080
of one trial learning.

01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:21.680
The first thing baby
birds are exposed

01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:24.700
to in many species, the first
big thing moving around,

01:14:24.700 --> 01:14:29.170
statistically likely to be mom,
that's who you get attached to.

01:14:29.170 --> 01:14:32.696
And lots of interesting
neuroethology

01:14:32.696 --> 01:14:34.070
has gone on over
the years trying

01:14:34.070 --> 01:14:36.630
to figure out what are the
mechanisms of imprinting.

01:14:36.630 --> 01:14:38.070
One of the things
that come out is

01:14:38.070 --> 01:14:42.310
it's nowhere near as dramatic
of critical periods--

01:14:42.310 --> 01:14:44.900
if you don't figure out who
mom is in the next 7 and 1/2

01:14:44.900 --> 01:14:46.590
minutes, you are up the creek.

01:14:46.590 --> 01:14:50.620
You will never-- it's more
a sort of relative term.

01:14:50.620 --> 01:14:53.380
But nonetheless, that's
not how learning works.

01:14:53.380 --> 01:14:55.970
You're supposed to learn
from trial and error that

01:14:55.970 --> 01:14:58.730
snakes, and leopards,
and all of those guys

01:14:58.730 --> 01:15:01.290
are not good mothering models.

01:15:01.290 --> 01:15:02.780
But it happens.

01:15:02.780 --> 01:15:04.410
Another realm.

01:15:04.410 --> 01:15:08.710
Something that came to be
known as prepared learning.

01:15:08.710 --> 01:15:11.460
Which is, there's
all sorts of ways

01:15:11.460 --> 01:15:14.860
in which some piece of
information can be learned.

01:15:14.860 --> 01:15:18.080
Or there's all sorts
of sensory associations

01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:20.660
you could make with
something, but you

01:15:20.660 --> 01:15:24.470
are prepared to make certain
of those associations

01:15:24.470 --> 01:15:26.430
more easily than others.

01:15:26.430 --> 01:15:27.945
What do I mean by this?

01:15:27.945 --> 01:15:30.220
A classic example
of it is what's

01:15:30.220 --> 01:15:32.690
called the sauce
Bearnaise syndrome.

01:15:32.690 --> 01:15:36.340
And sauce Bearnaise is
some fancy French food

01:15:36.340 --> 01:15:37.772
that seems very unappealing.

01:15:37.772 --> 01:15:39.230
And I don't know
what it's made of.

01:15:39.230 --> 01:15:43.385
But this was first described
by a guy, University

01:15:43.385 --> 01:15:45.720
of Pennsylvania,
Martin Seligman, one

01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:48.560
of the most sort
of major figures

01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:51.260
in psychology in the
last decades or so.

01:15:51.260 --> 01:15:53.390
We will hear plenty
about him to come.

01:15:53.390 --> 01:15:58.180
And this was, one evening
he went out for dinner,

01:15:58.180 --> 01:16:00.560
where he had sauce Bearnaise.

01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:05.530
And then he went to a concert
of some opera or something,

01:16:05.530 --> 01:16:07.210
and then he went home.

01:16:07.210 --> 01:16:11.190
And for some reason or other, he
got himself a terrible stomach

01:16:11.190 --> 01:16:12.610
ache.

01:16:12.610 --> 01:16:13.600
Terrible stomach ache.

01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:14.650
It was a total drag.

01:16:14.650 --> 01:16:16.130
All night long, he had it.

01:16:16.130 --> 01:16:17.230
He didn't throw up.

01:16:17.230 --> 01:16:18.100
It wasn't that bad.

01:16:18.100 --> 01:16:20.870
But he had a terrible stomach
ache, recovered from it.

01:16:20.870 --> 01:16:23.810
Weeks, months later,
he goes out for dinner.

01:16:23.810 --> 01:16:25.730
And he goes off to
this French restaurant,

01:16:25.730 --> 01:16:28.020
and has sauce Bearnaise,
and is about to take

01:16:28.020 --> 01:16:31.510
the first spoonful, or forkful,
or handful, or whatever.

01:16:31.510 --> 01:16:35.880
And he realizes this smells
totally repulsive to him.

01:16:35.880 --> 01:16:38.080
He could not eat
the sauce Bearnaise.

01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:40.520
He has never been
able to since then,

01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:44.850
because he's associating it with
the stomach pains afterward.

01:16:44.850 --> 01:16:46.180
Remember, he didn't throw up.

01:16:46.180 --> 01:16:49.600
He wasn't burping up sauce
Bearnaise vapors or anything.

01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:51.390
So it's not like, oh,
the taste was just

01:16:51.390 --> 01:16:54.560
like the acidic stuff that came
roaring up the other direction,

01:16:54.560 --> 01:16:56.590
just associating with
the stomach pain.

01:16:56.590 --> 01:16:57.090
OK.

01:16:57.090 --> 01:16:57.816
That's sensible.

01:16:57.816 --> 01:16:59.690
I mean, that's not great,
but you can kind of

01:16:59.690 --> 01:17:00.770
see how that happens.

01:17:00.770 --> 01:17:02.790
But you think about
it, and that's

01:17:02.790 --> 01:17:06.370
breaking all sorts of
classical rules of behaviorism

01:17:06.370 --> 01:17:07.610
and classical learning.

01:17:07.610 --> 01:17:11.400
Which is, if you were going to
make an association-- you can

01:17:11.400 --> 01:17:15.645
have a choice between an
association of a with b or a

01:17:15.645 --> 01:17:18.670
with c-- you're going to
make the association more

01:17:18.670 --> 01:17:23.670
readily with whichever one
comes closer in time to a.

01:17:23.670 --> 01:17:26.140
So what came closer
in time for him?

01:17:26.140 --> 01:17:27.270
The opera.

01:17:27.270 --> 01:17:29.650
He finished dinner, and
then he went to the opera

01:17:29.650 --> 01:17:32.580
and spent hours listening
to Wagner or something,

01:17:32.580 --> 01:17:35.750
and he didn't attribute
his stomach ache to that.

01:17:35.750 --> 01:17:37.960
The next time he went to
an opera, he was perfect.

01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:39.730
He was just fine with that.

01:17:39.730 --> 01:17:41.700
He had prepared learning.

01:17:41.700 --> 01:17:44.500
For pain coming
from your gut, you

01:17:44.500 --> 01:17:48.890
are far more likely to associate
with food than with music.

01:17:48.890 --> 01:17:53.090
Prepared learning in us
for pain in our GI tract

01:17:53.090 --> 01:17:55.800
with gustatory stimuli.

01:17:55.800 --> 01:17:58.040
More examples are
prepared learning.

01:17:58.040 --> 01:17:59.730
So now you take
these, and you're

01:17:59.730 --> 01:18:02.020
trying to teach them where
there's a food source.

01:18:02.020 --> 01:18:03.110
Experimental stuff.

01:18:03.110 --> 01:18:06.270
And you give them
some like mark or sign

01:18:06.270 --> 01:18:08.512
or whatever to tell them,
here it is, and remember

01:18:08.512 --> 01:18:09.470
this for the next time.

01:18:09.470 --> 01:18:12.510
Do they make an association
between the food source

01:18:12.510 --> 01:18:14.300
and whatever marker you put up?

01:18:14.300 --> 01:18:16.270
And what they show
in the studies is,

01:18:16.270 --> 01:18:18.080
they can modify the marker.

01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:20.460
They either modify the
shape of it-- here's

01:18:20.460 --> 01:18:24.240
a little triangle, square, or
whatever-- the color of it,

01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:27.190
or they can modify the smell.

01:18:27.190 --> 01:18:29.960
The smell that they-- some
smell source that they--

01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:33.430
And what they show is, bees
have prepared learning.

01:18:33.430 --> 01:18:37.130
They learn the smell
associations much, much faster

01:18:37.130 --> 01:18:39.360
than the shape or the
color associations.

01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:40.870
They can learn of
the other ones,

01:18:40.870 --> 01:18:45.010
but bees have prepared learning
for making associations

01:18:45.010 --> 01:18:48.160
by olfactory cues more
readily than making them

01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:51.000
by color or shape.

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:52.310
More examples.

01:18:52.310 --> 01:18:56.430
One of the great
urban legends is

01:18:56.430 --> 01:19:00.960
that humans are innately
scared of spiders and snakes.

01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:03.500
Humans are not, because
there's all sorts of cultures

01:19:03.500 --> 01:19:05.660
where people love spiders
and where, in fact, they

01:19:05.660 --> 01:19:06.267
love spiders.

01:19:06.267 --> 01:19:07.850
Because they love
to chase after them,

01:19:07.850 --> 01:19:10.450
and pull their legs out, and
then cook them up and eat them,

01:19:10.450 --> 01:19:13.350
and people are not scared
in front of spiders

01:19:13.350 --> 01:19:16.090
and getting the
willies from them.

01:19:16.090 --> 01:19:17.180
It is not innate.

01:19:17.180 --> 01:19:20.500
But humans show prepared
learning for being

01:19:20.500 --> 01:19:23.370
scared of spiders and snakes.

01:19:23.370 --> 01:19:27.820
Which is, you can show in
humans and in monkeys, as well,

01:19:27.820 --> 01:19:32.370
the conditioning that's needed
to associate, for example,

01:19:32.370 --> 01:19:35.850
a picture of a spider with
the autonomic response

01:19:35.850 --> 01:19:41.040
to a mild shock, versus
a picture of Disneyland

01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:43.410
and Mickey and associate it.

01:19:43.410 --> 01:19:46.510
That it takes less of
an association for we

01:19:46.510 --> 01:19:50.260
primates to associate something
like a spider or a snake

01:19:50.260 --> 01:19:53.740
picture with something
unpleasant than all sorts

01:19:53.740 --> 01:19:56.330
of other animate stimuli.

01:19:56.330 --> 01:19:58.500
More examples of how this works.

01:19:58.500 --> 01:20:00.530
You give people--
or, as it turns out,

01:20:00.530 --> 01:20:02.000
you give monkeys-- a task.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:05.270
You flash up a complex
picture, and you take it away

01:20:05.270 --> 01:20:06.840
for a few seconds or whatever.

01:20:06.840 --> 01:20:09.220
And then you flash it
up again, and one thing

01:20:09.220 --> 01:20:11.350
has changed in the picture.

01:20:11.350 --> 01:20:13.840
It's a street scene,
wherever it is.

01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:15.659
And you need to pick
out which it is.

01:20:15.659 --> 01:20:17.200
And with the monkey
studies, you need

01:20:17.200 --> 01:20:20.320
to indicate sort of where
it was to get the reward.

01:20:20.320 --> 01:20:23.560
Are you able to pick up the
subtle thing that changed?

01:20:23.560 --> 01:20:27.160
Humans and monkeys
are better picking up

01:20:27.160 --> 01:20:29.520
for animate objects
that change, are

01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:34.030
better at spotting if there
are things like snakes,

01:20:34.030 --> 01:20:37.470
than if they are animals that
we don't associate like that.

01:20:37.470 --> 01:20:40.700
We are better, in this
very rapid exposure, almost

01:20:40.700 --> 01:20:43.840
subliminal stimuli, we have
prepared learning for that.

01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:45.940
Do the exact sort of
thing with humans,

01:20:45.940 --> 01:20:48.690
where what changes from
one flash to the other

01:20:48.690 --> 01:20:52.700
is either an animate object
or an inanimate object.

01:20:52.700 --> 01:20:55.270
Humans have prepared
learning to pick up

01:20:55.270 --> 01:20:59.010
stimuli of animate objects
much, much more readily.

01:20:59.010 --> 01:21:03.170
A shorter exposure time, more of
a subliminal cue, all of that.

01:21:03.170 --> 01:21:07.440
So prepared learning is being
all of these examples where,

01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:11.040
by any logic, universal rules.

01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:13.980
You learn to associate this
with this, as BF Skinner,

01:21:13.980 --> 01:21:16.530
or just as easily with this,
or just as easily with this.

01:21:16.530 --> 01:21:18.950
And dog, and cat, and
they're interchangeable,

01:21:18.950 --> 01:21:20.140
and sensory stimuli.

01:21:20.140 --> 01:21:23.550
But no, all sorts of
species come already

01:21:23.550 --> 01:21:26.780
wired up to learn certain
associations more readily

01:21:26.780 --> 01:21:27.640
than others.

01:21:27.640 --> 01:21:31.520
So completely
violating behaviorism.

01:21:31.520 --> 01:21:32.790
OK.

01:21:32.790 --> 01:21:36.370
Final domain where ethologists
think about interesting stuff

01:21:36.370 --> 01:21:39.620
is one of those ones that used
to be just the backwaters,

01:21:39.620 --> 01:21:41.430
or one of those were
people would say,

01:21:41.430 --> 01:21:43.650
there's no way this
could ever be studied.

01:21:43.650 --> 01:21:45.660
And people finally
got some headway

01:21:45.660 --> 01:21:48.490
in figuring how to look at
this stuff, which is finally

01:21:48.490 --> 01:21:50.920
all sorts of
interesting things--

01:21:50.920 --> 01:21:55.460
not just studying the ethology
releasing stimuli, neurobiology

01:21:55.460 --> 01:21:59.440
adaptive advantage of
behaviors, but understanding

01:21:59.440 --> 01:22:04.020
what the internal cognitive and
emotional life is of an animal.

01:22:04.020 --> 01:22:06.280
And you can see, it's
right at this point

01:22:06.280 --> 01:22:08.470
that old classical
behaviorists would just

01:22:08.470 --> 01:22:11.590
have to leave the room they
were so repulsed by this.

01:22:11.590 --> 01:22:14.430
Because this was just
like William James

01:22:14.430 --> 01:22:16.020
navel contemplation.

01:22:16.020 --> 01:22:19.090
What do you mean what's going on
inside the head of the animal?

01:22:19.090 --> 01:22:20.340
You measure what it's doing.

01:22:20.340 --> 01:22:23.030
It produces a behavior, and
that's how you study it.

01:22:23.030 --> 01:22:25.910
And what instead has come
out is another new branch

01:22:25.910 --> 01:22:30.490
of ethology known as
cognitive ethology.

01:22:30.490 --> 01:22:32.800
What's going on there?

01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:35.040
One of these sort of
landmark ones of it--

01:22:35.040 --> 01:22:37.320
of sort of a piece of
it-- came from a guy

01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:40.410
named Donald Griffin, who
passed away a few years ago.

01:22:40.410 --> 01:22:41.600
He was in his 90s.

01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:46.700
He was one of the towering
figures of animal behavior,

01:22:46.700 --> 01:22:48.160
whatever, over the centuries.

01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:54.020
What Donald Griffin
discovered was echolocation--

01:22:54.020 --> 01:22:55.870
that bats echolocate.

01:22:55.870 --> 01:23:00.760
Classic, classic ethologist
flavored thing of, whoa!

01:23:00.760 --> 01:23:03.600
How about we interview the
bat in sound frequencies

01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:06.670
that we humans don't consider
to be sensory stimuli?

01:23:06.670 --> 01:23:08.710
And opening up this
whole new world.

01:23:08.710 --> 01:23:10.890
He was central,
played a key role

01:23:10.890 --> 01:23:14.020
in World War II in the
development of sonar,

01:23:14.020 --> 01:23:16.070
working off of some of
the same principles.

01:23:16.070 --> 01:23:19.000
But he's the person who
discovered echolocation.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.910
Just to make all of you who
are seniors feel really upset,

01:23:21.910 --> 01:23:24.710
this was his senior
honors thesis at Harvard.

01:23:24.710 --> 01:23:25.210
And, oh!

01:23:25.210 --> 01:23:27.270
Discovered echolocation.

01:23:27.270 --> 01:23:29.590
So he passed.

01:23:29.590 --> 01:23:32.750
And he spent his
entire career on this

01:23:32.750 --> 01:23:35.250
and doing amazingly
elegant stuff.

01:23:35.250 --> 01:23:37.810
And people came
to kiss his feet.

01:23:37.810 --> 01:23:40.770
He was such an amazing
experimentalist.

01:23:40.770 --> 01:23:42.820
And when he was
about 70 years old,

01:23:42.820 --> 01:23:44.810
clearly what
occurred to him was,

01:23:44.810 --> 01:23:48.040
I don't really care what anybody
else thinks at this point.

01:23:48.040 --> 01:23:49.990
I've got something that
I want to bring up,

01:23:49.990 --> 01:23:52.860
which is the possibility
that animals actually

01:23:52.860 --> 01:23:55.320
have awareness.

01:23:55.320 --> 01:23:58.130
And he published a book
called On the Question

01:23:58.130 --> 01:23:59.920
of Animal Awareness.

01:23:59.920 --> 01:24:03.800
And it's clear he published
it then because he had tenure.

01:24:03.800 --> 01:24:06.300
And he already had tenure
in his nursing home,

01:24:06.300 --> 01:24:08.750
and he wasn't going to get
booted out by everyone saying,

01:24:08.750 --> 01:24:11.900
oh my god, did you see what
happened to Donald Griffin?

01:24:11.900 --> 01:24:14.240
He used to be a real scientist.

01:24:14.240 --> 01:24:15.910
What happened to the guy?

01:24:15.910 --> 01:24:18.820
Here he is, sitting
around speculating on,

01:24:18.820 --> 01:24:22.660
do animals have internal
lives of awareness?

01:24:22.660 --> 01:24:26.630
And what he did was outline how
what a research program to get

01:24:26.630 --> 01:24:27.680
at that would be like.

01:24:27.680 --> 01:24:29.970
And people have been
studying it ever

01:24:29.970 --> 01:24:34.300
since and showing that animals
have strategic awareness.

01:24:34.300 --> 01:24:36.470
They are doing all
sorts of subtle really.

01:24:36.470 --> 01:24:37.940
Really interesting field.

01:24:37.940 --> 01:24:39.890
So starting it off with that.

01:24:39.890 --> 01:24:42.580
Closely related to
that was the issue

01:24:42.580 --> 01:24:45.630
of whether animals
have self-awareness.

01:24:45.630 --> 01:24:47.750
And we know that dogs
don't, because they

01:24:47.750 --> 01:24:50.590
will bark at themselves in the
mirror for the rest of time.

01:24:50.590 --> 01:24:52.490
But do animals have
self-awareness?

01:24:52.490 --> 01:24:56.010
This was something pioneered
by a guy named Gordon Gallup.

01:24:56.010 --> 01:24:59.600
And like one of those
brilliant, elegant studies.

01:24:59.600 --> 01:25:00.970
Here's what he did.

01:25:00.970 --> 01:25:03.920
He would take a chimp,
a captive chimp,

01:25:03.920 --> 01:25:06.640
and he would give it
a mild anesthetic,

01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:09.570
so the chip would be a little
bit drowsy for a minute or two.

01:25:09.570 --> 01:25:11.620
And while it was
down, he would quickly

01:25:11.620 --> 01:25:13.780
run in with a magic
marker and put

01:25:13.780 --> 01:25:17.240
a little circle like on
the forehead of the chimp.

01:25:17.240 --> 01:25:19.470
Chimp comes to, goes
back to its business,

01:25:19.470 --> 01:25:22.050
where there is now a
mirror in the room.

01:25:22.050 --> 01:25:24.020
And at some point, the
chimp comes up to it,

01:25:24.020 --> 01:25:26.670
because they'll wander
around and encounter this.

01:25:26.670 --> 01:25:29.520
And here's the critical
question right now.

01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:34.590
Can the chimp figure out that's
not another chimp, that's me?

01:25:34.590 --> 01:25:36.460
And what the evidence
was that he produced

01:25:36.460 --> 01:25:39.990
to suggest this was precisely
the case was showing

01:25:39.990 --> 01:25:43.197
the chimps were now far more
likely than at the chance

01:25:43.197 --> 01:25:44.780
level-- you see how
it's being set up,

01:25:44.780 --> 01:25:46.446
this is a well-designed
experiment-- far

01:25:46.446 --> 01:25:48.730
more likely to
look in the mirror

01:25:48.730 --> 01:25:51.780
and scratch here to
see what is this thing?

01:25:51.780 --> 01:25:53.860
Where did this thing come from?

01:25:53.860 --> 01:25:56.770
And that has been viewed
as the gold standard

01:25:56.770 --> 01:25:58.550
for self-awareness.

01:25:58.550 --> 01:26:01.330
Do you look at that
and respond as if you

01:26:01.330 --> 01:26:04.350
were knowing that that
is you rather than,

01:26:04.350 --> 01:26:05.710
that's some other animal?

01:26:05.710 --> 01:26:07.660
And self-awareness
by this test has been

01:26:07.660 --> 01:26:09.450
shown in all sorts of species.

01:26:09.450 --> 01:26:11.870
Elephants by this rule
have self-awareness.

01:26:11.870 --> 01:26:13.950
I don't know who puts
the magic marker thing up

01:26:13.950 --> 01:26:15.100
on their forehead.

01:26:15.100 --> 01:26:17.520
But when you do that, they
will bring the trunk up

01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:18.600
and investigate it.

01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:21.680
But interestingly,
marmoset monkeys--

01:26:21.680 --> 01:26:25.430
those delightful, pair bonding
for life South American

01:26:25.430 --> 01:26:28.800
monkeys-- marmoset monkeys
don't have self-awareness.

01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:30.820
And that's kind of
puzzling, because all sorts

01:26:30.820 --> 01:26:33.150
of other primates
that in the rough way

01:26:33.150 --> 01:26:35.790
are as neurobiologically
complex had it.

01:26:35.790 --> 01:26:36.880
And they don't.

01:26:36.880 --> 01:26:39.600
And, OK, so Marmoset
monkeys don't.

01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:43.520
But then an ethologist, a guy
named Marc Hauser at Harvard,

01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:46.200
thought in the
monkey's own language.

01:26:46.200 --> 01:26:49.960
And knowing marmosets-- he was
a marmoset researcher-- in order

01:26:49.960 --> 01:26:53.670
to spot this on your forehead,
if you were a monkey,

01:26:53.670 --> 01:26:55.920
you have to be looking
in the mirror something

01:26:55.920 --> 01:26:59.370
very close to looking in
your reflection's eyes.

01:26:59.370 --> 01:27:03.140
And marmosets don't do that as
part of their social system.

01:27:03.140 --> 01:27:05.140
They never noticed
there was this up there,

01:27:05.140 --> 01:27:08.280
because they never look up at
that part of their reflection.

01:27:08.280 --> 01:27:11.550
So what he would do is, he
would now do the same paradigm

01:27:11.550 --> 01:27:13.260
and put the little dot here.

01:27:13.260 --> 01:27:15.640
And marmosets, off
they are a minute later

01:27:15.640 --> 01:27:18.200
trying to figure out what
this thing was about.

01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:21.830
Interviewing the animal
in its own language.

01:27:21.830 --> 01:27:22.820
What else?

01:27:22.820 --> 01:27:24.360
Another domain of this.

01:27:24.360 --> 01:27:27.050
So awareness, self awareness.

01:27:27.050 --> 01:27:31.330
Another thing now shown in other
species called theory of mind.

01:27:31.330 --> 01:27:34.440
One that psychologists,
developmental psychologists

01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:35.150
love.

01:27:35.150 --> 01:27:36.600
Theory of mind.

01:27:36.600 --> 01:27:38.510
At what point when
you were growing up

01:27:38.510 --> 01:27:41.780
do you suddenly
realize, number one,

01:27:41.780 --> 01:27:43.490
there are other individuals?

01:27:43.490 --> 01:27:45.740
There are boundaries
to individuals.

01:27:45.740 --> 01:27:48.750
You are not one sort
of ego boundaryless

01:27:48.750 --> 01:27:50.800
sort of continuation of mom.

01:27:50.800 --> 01:27:52.510
There's other
individuals who could

01:27:52.510 --> 01:27:56.960
have different information
about the world than you do.

01:27:56.960 --> 01:28:00.290
And that usually comes
around age 4 or 5 or so.

01:28:00.290 --> 01:28:03.450
My children got theory of
mind when they were 3 and 1/2.

01:28:03.450 --> 01:28:05.410
And we can document
that if need be,

01:28:05.410 --> 01:28:07.780
but it comes out
somewhere around then.

01:28:07.780 --> 01:28:10.730
And what you see-- it's a
classic test that it's done.

01:28:10.730 --> 01:28:15.176
You tell the child a story,
OK, here's the-- some of you

01:28:15.176 --> 01:28:15.800
will know this.

01:28:15.800 --> 01:28:18.180
The Mary Ann, the Barbie Ann?

01:28:18.180 --> 01:28:19.400
The Sally Anne.

01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:20.060
OK.

01:28:20.060 --> 01:28:23.060
The Sally Anne test
of theory of mind.

01:28:23.060 --> 01:28:25.720
So you tell this kid
this story about,

01:28:25.720 --> 01:28:31.380
here's this kid who has
their doll named Sally Anne.

01:28:31.380 --> 01:28:32.810
Sally?

01:28:32.810 --> 01:28:33.750
OK, Sally.

01:28:39.300 --> 01:28:39.950
OK.

01:28:39.950 --> 01:28:44.072
So they have this
doll named Sally Anne.

01:28:44.072 --> 01:28:46.530
And you tell them-- they're
totally attached to Sally Anne.

01:28:46.530 --> 01:28:48.030
They go to sleep
with it, and always

01:28:48.030 --> 01:28:49.560
on the bed, and all of that.

01:28:49.560 --> 01:28:53.960
And the kid goes off every
day to preschool or whatever.

01:28:53.960 --> 01:28:56.960
And this is the day that mom
looks at Sally Anne there

01:28:56.960 --> 01:28:59.340
and says, oh no, Sally
Anne is all soiled,

01:28:59.340 --> 01:29:01.760
and it's time to throw Sally
Anne in the washing machine.

01:29:01.760 --> 01:29:03.780
So in goes Sally Anne.

01:29:03.780 --> 01:29:05.280
And Sally Anne is
then on the dryer,

01:29:05.280 --> 01:29:06.905
eventually sitting
on top of the dryer,

01:29:06.905 --> 01:29:09.840
when child comes
back from school.

01:29:09.840 --> 01:29:12.690
And now you say to the
kid you're testing, oh,

01:29:12.690 --> 01:29:17.500
where's that child going to
go and look for Sally Anne?

01:29:17.500 --> 01:29:20.220
If you have theory
of mind, you will

01:29:20.220 --> 01:29:23.170
know the kid doesn't know
that Sally Anne wound up

01:29:23.170 --> 01:29:26.050
in the washing machine, because
she was off at preschool.

01:29:26.050 --> 01:29:30.550
And you would then say,
oh, still in the bedroom.

01:29:30.550 --> 01:29:33.130
On the other hand, if you
don't have theory of mind,

01:29:33.130 --> 01:29:36.730
it's inconceivable to you
that the child in the story

01:29:36.730 --> 01:29:38.660
wouldn't know, because you know.

01:29:38.660 --> 01:29:41.307
And they must know the
same thing, because we all

01:29:41.307 --> 01:29:42.140
know the same thing.

01:29:42.140 --> 01:29:43.848
And you would say,
the child will go look

01:29:43.848 --> 01:29:45.040
on the washing machine.

01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:48.170
That's how you begin to see
the evidence of beginning

01:29:48.170 --> 01:29:50.960
to understand that
another individual has

01:29:50.960 --> 01:29:53.230
different information
than you have.

01:29:53.230 --> 01:29:57.200
And people were soon
showing this with chimps.

01:29:57.200 --> 01:29:58.310
Here would be one example.

01:30:03.750 --> 01:30:04.640
That's not a smile.

01:30:04.640 --> 01:30:05.610
That's a banana.

01:30:05.610 --> 01:30:08.730
So you would have one chimp
here and one chimp here.

01:30:08.730 --> 01:30:12.290
And here's how you would do
this paradigm, which is this

01:30:12.290 --> 01:30:14.390
would be a high ranking chimp.

01:30:14.390 --> 01:30:17.370
This would be a low ranking one.

01:30:17.370 --> 01:30:20.290
Put him in there,
and they're watching.

01:30:20.290 --> 01:30:24.280
And an experimenter
comes along and puts down

01:30:24.280 --> 01:30:28.910
a really cool piece
of food and in a way

01:30:28.910 --> 01:30:31.479
that the chimps can't
necessarily see.

01:30:31.479 --> 01:30:33.020
But the main thing
here is that there

01:30:33.020 --> 01:30:36.750
are these dividers in between.

01:30:36.750 --> 01:30:41.350
In one case the divider,
near the dominant individual,

01:30:41.350 --> 01:30:44.130
is glass.

01:30:44.130 --> 01:30:45.530
They can see through it.

01:30:45.530 --> 01:30:47.950
In the other case, it's opaque.

01:30:47.950 --> 01:30:49.670
They can't see through it.

01:30:49.670 --> 01:30:53.160
So now, you release the
chimps to go for the food.

01:30:53.160 --> 01:30:55.780
And what happens is
the low ranking guy--

01:30:55.780 --> 01:30:59.480
if and only if this
was glass here--

01:30:59.480 --> 01:31:01.810
doesn't bother trying
to get the banana.

01:31:01.810 --> 01:31:06.150
Because he knows the
other guy saw the banana.

01:31:06.150 --> 01:31:10.370
Put up an opaque one, and
now he will go for it.

01:31:10.370 --> 01:31:11.610
Design is all wrong here.

01:31:11.610 --> 01:31:14.310
There's no divider here.

01:31:14.310 --> 01:31:16.000
So release this guy.

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.220
And if this was
opaque, he will now

01:31:18.220 --> 01:31:20.580
go for it, because he
knows the other guy doesn't

01:31:20.580 --> 01:31:22.050
know there's a banana there.

01:31:22.050 --> 01:31:25.020
He knows that the other guy
has different information

01:31:25.020 --> 01:31:25.920
than he does.

01:31:25.920 --> 01:31:29.080
Parts of the controls you
would expect to see now

01:31:29.080 --> 01:31:33.320
have this with the glass here,
where the dominant individual

01:31:33.320 --> 01:31:36.300
sees somebody bring in the
banana, shows it to them,

01:31:36.300 --> 01:31:38.430
put it down behind
the opaque screen.

01:31:38.430 --> 01:31:40.920
And take out this
dominant guy, and put

01:31:40.920 --> 01:31:43.940
in a different dominant
guy, let them loose,

01:31:43.940 --> 01:31:46.190
and he will go for the banana.

01:31:46.190 --> 01:31:48.750
Because he knows, oh,
it's not simply the rule

01:31:48.750 --> 01:31:51.710
that dominant guys who scare
me know there's a banana there.

01:31:51.710 --> 01:31:54.070
They know, he's the one
who saw there's the banana.

01:31:54.070 --> 01:31:56.740
This guy doesn't know
there's a banana there.

01:31:56.740 --> 01:31:58.220
Theory of mind.

01:31:58.220 --> 01:32:01.750
Or now do it with a
lower ranking individual,

01:32:01.750 --> 01:32:03.690
and it doesn't matter
to you whether or not

01:32:03.690 --> 01:32:05.410
they could look through
the glass or not.

01:32:05.410 --> 01:32:06.520
You're going to
go for the banana,

01:32:06.520 --> 01:32:08.270
because you're going
to get it regardless.

01:32:08.270 --> 01:32:10.390
The first bits of
evidence of theory

01:32:10.390 --> 01:32:16.160
of mind that a chimp understands
that other chimps have

01:32:16.160 --> 01:32:18.340
different information than them.

01:32:18.340 --> 01:32:20.800
What the studies
since then have shown

01:32:20.800 --> 01:32:24.220
is that chimps do not know
how to do theory of mind

01:32:24.220 --> 01:32:26.060
in a cooperative setting.

01:32:26.060 --> 01:32:28.816
They can only do
it for competition.

01:32:28.816 --> 01:32:30.190
They can only do
it when they are

01:32:30.190 --> 01:32:32.600
highly motivated in that way.

01:32:32.600 --> 01:32:34.590
But still, this is an ape.

01:32:34.590 --> 01:32:36.960
This is really quite impressive.

01:32:36.960 --> 01:32:39.520
Birds can do theory of mind.

01:32:39.520 --> 01:32:42.630
Apparently, the smartest
birds in the entire universe

01:32:42.630 --> 01:32:47.550
are corvids, which are ravens
and crows who are wildly smart.

01:32:47.550 --> 01:32:49.740
And all sorts of
interesting ethology studies

01:32:49.740 --> 01:32:53.360
that have been done on them,
including doing theory of mind.

01:32:53.360 --> 01:32:57.110
You show, with these
guys, you give them nuts

01:32:57.110 --> 01:32:59.810
or whatever it is,
seeds or whatever, which

01:32:59.810 --> 01:33:01.540
they will hide in places.

01:33:01.540 --> 01:33:05.290
And if there is another
one around looking at them,

01:33:05.290 --> 01:33:06.500
they won't hide it.

01:33:06.500 --> 01:33:07.810
Or they'll put it there.

01:33:07.810 --> 01:33:11.120
They'll dig it down into the
sawdust there or whatever.

01:33:11.120 --> 01:33:12.890
And when the other
guy isn't looking,

01:33:12.890 --> 01:33:15.580
they'll quick get it and
move it to someplace else.

01:33:15.580 --> 01:33:19.080
Because they will know,
when it's over here,

01:33:19.080 --> 01:33:21.430
that this guy doesn't
have the information.

01:33:21.430 --> 01:33:25.610
They can do theory of
mind when stashing food.

01:33:25.610 --> 01:33:27.980
More things that
animals can do that fall

01:33:27.980 --> 01:33:31.930
within the realm of this
cognitive ethology stuff, which

01:33:31.930 --> 01:33:34.380
is animals can
distinguish between

01:33:34.380 --> 01:33:38.190
intentional and
unintentional behaviors.

01:33:38.190 --> 01:33:39.880
How has this been
done in studies?

01:33:39.880 --> 01:33:42.910
One example, you take a
chimp, a captive chimp.

01:33:42.910 --> 01:33:47.590
And it has some totally great
food item sitting out there

01:33:47.590 --> 01:33:49.750
that it's about
to get access to.

01:33:49.750 --> 01:33:53.640
And along comes some lummox
of a human walking through.

01:33:53.640 --> 01:33:56.730
And in one case,
the human leans down

01:33:56.730 --> 01:34:00.680
and takes the plate of food
and flings it someplace else.

01:34:00.680 --> 01:34:02.480
And in the other
circumstance, the human

01:34:02.480 --> 01:34:05.240
comes along and accidentally
trips over the plate,

01:34:05.240 --> 01:34:06.890
flinging it someplace else.

01:34:06.890 --> 01:34:10.600
When the human leans
down and flung it away,

01:34:10.600 --> 01:34:13.930
the chimp will bang on
the walls a lot longer

01:34:13.930 --> 01:34:16.970
than when the person
accidentally tripped over it.

01:34:16.970 --> 01:34:20.510
Chimps can distinguish between
intentional and unintentional

01:34:20.510 --> 01:34:22.120
gestures like that.

01:34:22.120 --> 01:34:24.340
And dogs know the difference.

01:34:24.340 --> 01:34:26.160
Dogs absolutely
know the difference

01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:27.750
between somebody
who has kicked them

01:34:27.750 --> 01:34:30.440
and somebody who has
tripped over them.

01:34:30.440 --> 01:34:33.020
All sorts of stuff
like that, as well.

01:34:33.020 --> 01:34:34.050
What else?

01:34:34.050 --> 01:34:37.980
Evidence of animals being
able to plan for the future.

01:34:37.980 --> 01:34:40.400
And one great
example of this has

01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:42.600
been with those corvid birds.

01:34:42.600 --> 01:34:46.690
And here you have a
design where every day,

01:34:46.690 --> 01:34:50.240
there's two compartments
that the bird can go into.

01:34:50.240 --> 01:34:52.032
And on one day,
you put food here.

01:34:52.032 --> 01:34:53.990
And the next day there,
and the next day there.

01:34:53.990 --> 01:34:55.740
You alternate back and forth.

01:34:55.740 --> 01:34:58.880
The key thing is, any
time you put food in here,

01:34:58.880 --> 01:35:01.857
you put a huge amount in here.

01:35:01.857 --> 01:35:03.690
And at the end of the
day, you clear it out.

01:35:03.690 --> 01:35:05.398
Whereas when you're
putting in food here,

01:35:05.398 --> 01:35:07.470
you're putting in
only a tiny amount.

01:35:07.470 --> 01:35:10.140
So on alternating days,
they get a lot here.

01:35:10.140 --> 01:35:11.470
The next day, a little bit.

01:35:11.470 --> 01:35:12.600
A lot here, a little.

01:35:12.600 --> 01:35:15.910
And what you show, what you see
after not that long of a time,

01:35:15.910 --> 01:35:19.110
is these guys, on the day
that there's food here,

01:35:19.110 --> 01:35:23.870
will take some of it and stash
it there for the next day.

01:35:23.870 --> 01:35:26.340
Ravens and crows will do this.

01:35:26.340 --> 01:35:29.080
This is planning for the future.

01:35:29.080 --> 01:35:31.910
They have flexible,
cognitive strategies.

01:35:31.910 --> 01:35:34.010
Here's what's been
shown in bees.

01:35:34.010 --> 01:35:34.510
OK.

01:35:34.510 --> 01:35:36.880
So you do your basic
Hugo Von Frisch deal.

01:35:36.880 --> 01:35:40.030
Which is you show a bee some
interesting food source.

01:35:40.030 --> 01:35:42.510
They go back to the hive, and
they dance and tell everybody

01:35:42.510 --> 01:35:43.300
about it.

01:35:43.300 --> 01:35:45.170
But this time,
what you do is you

01:35:45.170 --> 01:35:48.940
give the bee completely
ridiculous, implausible

01:35:48.940 --> 01:35:50.010
information.

01:35:50.010 --> 01:35:51.750
You take the bee
out to the middle

01:35:51.750 --> 01:35:55.440
of the lake in your rowboat,
and you give him the food there,

01:35:55.440 --> 01:35:56.260
the nectar.

01:35:56.260 --> 01:36:00.320
And they go flying back to the
hive, and they dance like mad,

01:36:00.320 --> 01:36:02.590
and everything we
know about ethology

01:36:02.590 --> 01:36:05.020
predicts what the bees are
supposed to do at this point.

01:36:05.020 --> 01:36:06.860
But the bees don't do that.

01:36:06.860 --> 01:36:09.970
Because, in effect, they're
sitting there saying, yeah,

01:36:09.970 --> 01:36:10.600
right.

01:36:10.600 --> 01:36:11.860
In the middle of the lake?

01:36:11.860 --> 01:36:12.800
You know what you're telling us?

01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:15.150
You're telling us there's food
over in the middle of the lake

01:36:15.150 --> 01:36:15.730
there.

01:36:15.730 --> 01:36:17.410
That doesn't make any sense.

01:36:17.410 --> 01:36:18.820
We're not going
to listen to you.

01:36:18.820 --> 01:36:21.930
They don't respond if a bee,
thanks to an experimental

01:36:21.930 --> 01:36:25.500
manipulation, is telling about
a food source in a place that

01:36:25.500 --> 01:36:27.430
cannot possibly be.

01:36:27.430 --> 01:36:30.460
Flexible cognitive strategies.

01:36:30.460 --> 01:36:34.270
Finally, some evidence
in various species,

01:36:34.270 --> 01:36:38.130
but predominately studied
in chimps, of numerosity.

01:36:38.130 --> 01:36:42.730
Numerosity, as in having
a sense of numbers

01:36:42.730 --> 01:36:45.240
having meaning in
and of themselves.

01:36:45.240 --> 01:36:48.131
This is totally cool,
this experiment.

01:36:48.131 --> 01:36:48.630
OK.

01:36:48.630 --> 01:36:55.430
What you do is you teach a
chimp a series of three objects.

01:36:55.430 --> 01:36:57.640
And you show him
the first three,

01:36:57.640 --> 01:37:00.130
and they need to
recognize that, if I've

01:37:00.130 --> 01:37:03.620
seen this one before, I press
a lever, I get a food reward.

01:37:03.620 --> 01:37:06.720
You train them at the
same time to recognize

01:37:06.720 --> 01:37:08.780
three other pictures--
another trio,

01:37:08.780 --> 01:37:10.290
another trio, another trio.

01:37:10.290 --> 01:37:12.950
So the chimp has now learned
a dozen different trios

01:37:12.950 --> 01:37:15.010
of pictures and
knows how to do that.

01:37:15.010 --> 01:37:17.730
If I have seen this trio
before, hit the lever,

01:37:17.730 --> 01:37:19.190
and I get a food reward.

01:37:19.190 --> 01:37:23.020
Now what you do is
you make a mistake.

01:37:23.020 --> 01:37:28.180
What you do is you take--
here, instead of HIJ,

01:37:28.180 --> 01:37:32.350
you take out the J, and
you substitute it with A.

01:37:32.350 --> 01:37:36.440
In this case, what you
do is you take out the I,

01:37:36.440 --> 01:37:40.380
and you substitute it with
B. What's the difference?

01:37:40.380 --> 01:37:43.230
In this first case,
what you're doing is

01:37:43.230 --> 01:37:47.480
you're removing the third
object in the sequence

01:37:47.480 --> 01:37:50.540
and replacing it with
something from the first object

01:37:50.540 --> 01:37:52.170
in a different sequence.

01:37:52.170 --> 01:37:55.260
In this case, you're
replacing a second object

01:37:55.260 --> 01:37:58.920
in the sequence with another
second object in the sequence.

01:37:58.920 --> 01:38:02.800
And when you do this
quickly, tasks quickly,

01:38:02.800 --> 01:38:06.650
chimps make more mistakes
with this than with this.

01:38:06.650 --> 01:38:08.424
What's going on in their heads?

01:38:08.424 --> 01:38:10.340
They're saying, oh yeah,
this one looks right.

01:38:10.340 --> 01:38:12.260
No, wait, that one's not right.

01:38:12.260 --> 01:38:16.460
It's a different number two
than the one for this trio.

01:38:16.460 --> 01:38:20.150
When it matches the
number in the sequence,

01:38:20.150 --> 01:38:23.020
they make more mistakes,
because they have partially

01:38:23.020 --> 01:38:23.990
filed it away.

01:38:23.990 --> 01:38:27.250
Not only have I seen this
picture before-- not only

01:38:27.250 --> 01:38:30.560
have I seen this picture
before as part of this trio,

01:38:30.560 --> 01:38:34.350
but when I see it as the trio,
it's the third one that I see.

01:38:34.350 --> 01:38:36.890
It's the first one
they have had some sort

01:38:36.890 --> 01:38:40.540
of numerosity information
coming in there.

01:38:40.540 --> 01:38:43.560
Another study showing this,
and this one with chimps.

01:38:43.560 --> 01:38:46.000
And in this one, what
you do is a strategy

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.790
you've heard already,
which is you record

01:38:48.790 --> 01:38:50.240
the vocalizations of chimps.

01:38:50.240 --> 01:38:54.810
And what you do is you record
the sounds of big male chimps

01:38:54.810 --> 01:38:56.860
giving threatening bellows.

01:38:56.860 --> 01:39:00.430
So now, you hide the
speaker in some bush there,

01:39:00.430 --> 01:39:02.210
and you've got
your chimps nearby.

01:39:02.210 --> 01:39:05.850
And you play the sound of
some big male bellowing,

01:39:05.850 --> 01:39:07.800
and it's a chimp they've
never heard before.

01:39:07.800 --> 01:39:10.940
Chimps recognize individual
voices, no big surprise.

01:39:10.940 --> 01:39:12.810
And what happens is
all the males run over

01:39:12.810 --> 01:39:14.930
to the bush to investigate.

01:39:14.930 --> 01:39:17.520
Now make it a little scarier.

01:39:17.520 --> 01:39:21.370
Play the sound of two
strange male chimps

01:39:21.370 --> 01:39:24.300
bellowing, giving their
territorial calls.

01:39:24.300 --> 01:39:25.820
And do you run over or not?

01:39:25.820 --> 01:39:27.580
You have a whole bunch
of males run over.

01:39:27.580 --> 01:39:29.060
Now make it even scarier.

01:39:29.060 --> 01:39:30.750
Three voices of them.

01:39:30.750 --> 01:39:34.590
And what you see is, by the time
it gets up to there, if there

01:39:34.590 --> 01:39:38.560
are more voices of novel
males that they're hearing,

01:39:38.560 --> 01:39:40.770
than the number of
males in their group,

01:39:40.770 --> 01:39:41.980
they get out of there.

01:39:41.980 --> 01:39:44.500
And what you'll see is, they're
playing the voice there.

01:39:44.500 --> 01:39:46.940
They begin, and they add in
another one sequentially.

01:39:46.940 --> 01:39:49.320
And say this will come
up to four voices,

01:39:49.320 --> 01:39:51.600
and they'll show the three
chimps are like coming

01:39:51.600 --> 01:39:53.140
up there ready to investigate.

01:39:53.140 --> 01:39:56.520
And three voices, and
uh-oh, we're out numbered.

01:39:56.520 --> 01:39:57.130
Numbered.

01:39:57.130 --> 01:39:58.230
We're out numbered.

01:39:58.230 --> 01:40:01.200
And they slither back and go
the other way at that point.

01:40:01.200 --> 01:40:04.560
They have a sense of
the number four is

01:40:04.560 --> 01:40:06.550
bigger than the number three.

01:40:06.550 --> 01:40:09.350
Finally, evidence of
transitive thinking.

01:40:09.350 --> 01:40:11.820
Not just in nonhuman
primates, but as

01:40:11.820 --> 01:40:16.500
shown here by Russ Fernals in
the bio department in fish.

01:40:16.500 --> 01:40:20.210
I'm watching a defeat b.

01:40:20.210 --> 01:40:22.770
Then b defeats me.

01:40:22.770 --> 01:40:25.750
I go and give a
subordinate gesture to a.

01:40:25.750 --> 01:40:27.190
And this has now been shown.

01:40:27.190 --> 01:40:29.740
And a similar theme
again, it's only

01:40:29.740 --> 01:40:32.600
done in the context
of competition,

01:40:32.600 --> 01:40:34.580
highly motivated circumstances.

01:40:34.580 --> 01:40:35.080
OK.

01:40:35.080 --> 01:40:36.260
So what do we got now?

01:40:36.260 --> 01:40:39.440
We've got a completely different
way of thinking about behavior

01:40:39.440 --> 01:40:44.210
and emphasizing here natural
setting-- experimentation

01:40:44.210 --> 01:40:46.980
rather than coming up with
those just so stories.

01:40:46.980 --> 01:40:49.180
The notions of all
sorts of species,

01:40:49.180 --> 01:40:52.650
including us, functioning
in sensory domains that

01:40:52.650 --> 01:40:54.030
are unheard of.

01:40:54.030 --> 01:40:57.090
And finally, all sorts
of types of learning that

01:40:57.090 --> 01:40:59.180
are ways in which
organisms are not supposed

01:40:59.180 --> 01:41:01.910
to learn that all of us do.
