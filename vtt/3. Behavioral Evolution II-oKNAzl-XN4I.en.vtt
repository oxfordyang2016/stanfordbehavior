00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.958
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:05.938
Stanford University.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.600
OK.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:11.380
Let's get going.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.280
Various announcements,
procedural things.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.620
A number of people want more
information about grading

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.580
and what the exams
are like, all of that.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.740
I think I mentioned
one-third of the points

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.800
will come from the midterm,
2/3 from the final.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.890
In terms of the
style of the midterm,

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.500
the midterm is
heavily going to be

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.550
about making sure you
got down all the factoids

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.130
from the first
half of the course,

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.460
that you've got the basics of
each of our proverbial buckets.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.520
The second half of
the final is all

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.730
going to be about
integration, thinking

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.550
across the different categories.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.030
So just a sense of that.

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:49.920
Readings.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.770
Readings, as they
are coming out,

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.340
the books are not required until
the second half of the course.

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.640
The handout on
Monday, I think, said

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.430
which chapters of
the [? Zebra ?] book

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.640
you should read.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.680
We will shortly get to you which
chapters of the [? Chaos ?]

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.490
book you should read as well.

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.270
The readings that
are being posted

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.920
on the CourseWorks, the
downloads of various published

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.130
papers, those are required.

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.940
I'm clear on those
whether this is

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.240
a paper you should read
all of, if this is one you

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.860
should read the abstract of.

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.350
Even if you read all
of, do not read it

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.200
in some obsessive,
detail-oriented way.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.650
The goal is probably to be
able to say, in one or two

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.040
paragraphs, why this paper
has something pertinent to say

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.200
about the topic they fell into.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.350
You're not sitting there
having to memorize techniques,

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.610
middle names of the authors,
how many animals, anything

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:41.952
like that.

00:01:41.952 --> 00:01:43.660
In terms of that, it
probably makes sense

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.240
to read those after the
first lecture of whatever

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.930
block there is.

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.010
And hopefully, if
I get organized,

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.970
I'll be able to get you sort
of a list of the readings

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.490
further in advance than
one week in advance.

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.660
Nonetheless, you should
probably hold off reading it

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.200
until after the lecture occurs.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.710
Let's see.

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:02.210
What else?

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.160
People wanted to get a
sense of how long things

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.320
were going to go.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.430
As we'll see today, the
evolution lecture topic

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:11.130
will cover two classes.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.340
Molecular genetics, which is
what we'll pick up on Monday,

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.040
I'm guessing one
to one and a half.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.890
Behavior genetics following
that, one to one and a half,

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.470
ethology one.

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.660
Neurobiology,
endocrinology, we'll

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.480
have one week devoted
to intro to the topics.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.280
And again, that's one where this
is so important for everybody

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.270
to be up to speed rather
than these being in catch-up

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.500
sections that week.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.270
The whole week, Monday,
Wednesday, Friday,

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.780
will be devoted to that
with the TAs teaching it.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.090
The following week, three more
lectures, more advanced ones.

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.970
And depending on
proximity to the midterm,

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.250
there may be a half-lecture
in there on statistics,

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.980
or maybe not.

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.560
So this is going to depend
on keeping on schedule.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.190
This is a rough approximation.

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.230
The midterm is going
to be a Monday night.

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.760
You will be responsible for
material up to the previous

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.880
Wednesday, and there will
be lots of review stuff.

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.930
Take a look at the extended
notes being posted.

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:05.610
What else?

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.970
OK.

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.410
I think that covers most
of the procedural stuff.

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.980
All of this stuff will
get posted as well.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.990
So picking up on the other day.

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.010
What was happening
the other day?

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.640
Number one, the trouncing of
Darwin inventing evolution,

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.640
trouncing of survival
of the fittest,

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.360
probably most
importantly, trouncing

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.880
of behavior for the good
of the species, group

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.380
selection-type arguments.

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.760
What we saw was, number one, the
rationale for the whole thing.

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.000
There is a vicious,
un-fightable logic

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.280
to why hearts have to be the
size they are and kidneys

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.550
have the filtration
rates they have to have

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:46.410
in order to solve the
challenges of leaving

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.930
as many copies of your genes
in the next generation.

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.260
And making sense of the
evolution of hearts and kidneys

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.400
and things like that
could be the worlds

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.170
of bioengineers and biomechanics
folks with an underlying logic

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.140
that it's got to
be something that

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.130
increases the number of copies
of genes that you leave.

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:06.750
And the whole rationale for
Wednesday's lecture and today

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.330
is applying the same sort
of logic to behavior.

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:14.690
The whole world of just
as you can optimize

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.390
sort of the way one's neck, how
long it is if you're a giraffe,

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.200
you can optimize
behavioral strategies.

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.310
And again, also for
a caveat, no animal

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.550
is sitting there, maybe with the
exception of some other apes,

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.110
sitting there consciously
strategizing along those lines.

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.400
One saying, so what would
you, as this dandelion,

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.240
want to do at that point with
this ecological challenge,

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.880
personifying just to
make things easier.

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:40.390
OK.

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:44.090
What we then barreled into were
the three major building blocks

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.460
for thinking about the
evolution of behavior

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.140
in the framework of contemporary
evolutionary thinking.

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:52.040
Number one,
individual selection--

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.310
passing on as many
copies of your own genes

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.460
to the next
generation as possible

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.430
by way of your own reproducing.

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.460
The individual
selection-- a chicken

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.130
is an egg's way to
make another egg.

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.510
I've now rehearsed that, so
I've got that down right.

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:09.290
The whole notion of behavior as
just being this epi-phenomenon

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:12.780
in order to do what's needed to
get another copy of the genes

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.450
into the next generation.

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:16.770
Building block number two.

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:19.840
Some of the time, the best way
to increase the number of genes

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.610
you pass on to the
next generation

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:25.330
is to help your relatives
do so following that logic

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.560
of Mendelian relatedness.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.720
And people in the
catch-up section, I know,

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.650
went over issues of, why is it
that you share half your genes

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:36.770
with a full sibling, a quarter
with a half sibling, et cetera?

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:41.100
So sometimes the way to maximize
is by helping out a relative

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.570
to do so with,
again, constrained

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:46.360
by this vicious
mathematical logic of,

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.340
it depends on how related
you are to the relative.

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:51.910
And thus, you will
gladly lay down your life

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:55.540
for one identical twin, two
full siblings, eight cousins.

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:56.920
Off you go.

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:00.360
So the whole notion
there of insight into why

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.980
social animals the galaxy
over are so obsessed

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:06.930
with kinship and
relatedness, the whole world

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:10.320
of who counts as an us,
who counts as a them

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.260
in terms of
cooperative behaviors

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.970
playing out along
lines of relatedness.

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:19.310
Finally, we saw the third piece,
which was reciprocal altruism.

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:21.590
You scratch my back,
I'll scratch yours.

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:25.140
Many hands make the task
less scratchy or whatever.

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:27.170
And what you see in
those cases, there

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:30.330
is a whole world
in which you don't

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.640
have to be related
to have cooperation.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.120
And we saw all the
domains of that bringing

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.150
in the formalization--
biomechanics person

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:41.270
figuring out how strong
a leg bone has to be.

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:43.900
A game theorist figuring
out within the realm

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:46.240
of social behavior
when you cooperate

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.990
and when you don't and
what sort of strategies.

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:51.240
Game theory, of seeing
the prisoner's dilemma

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:54.530
as the building block
of that entire field

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:58.640
and seeing all the strategies
worked out by mathematicians

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:02.050
and economists and diplomats
and seeing which ones optimize

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:03.470
under what circumstance.

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:05.340
And then going and
look in the real world

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:08.510
and seeing there's all
sorts of animals out there

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:12.670
that have evolved optimization
strategies of when to cooperate

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:13.990
and when to defect.

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:17.580
And what we'll get to as a huge,
huge issue by the time we get

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:21.040
to the lectures on aggression,
cooperation, et cetera is,

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:24.240
well, that's great when you've
got a cooperative system going.

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:26.080
How do they ever start?

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.890
How do you jump start
cooperation in systems?

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:31.340
The evolution of
cooperation, that's

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:35.150
something we will get to in
great detail down the line.

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:37.790
Finally, what we shifted
to was now saying,

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:40.330
great, we've got all these
principles in hand here

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:43.210
and our big three building
blocks and all of that.

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:46.660
How would it be applied to
making sense of animal behavior

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:47.970
out in the real world?

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:51.430
And we left with the examples
starting someplace there--

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:57.100
where did it go, yes, that's
it-- of us marching through,

00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:00.680
know one individual
factoid about some species

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:02.910
or other species,
know that there's

00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:05.890
a big difference between
the genders in size

00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:08.110
or there isn't, know
that there's not

00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:10.140
high levels of
aggression in males,

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:12.230
know that females
always give birth.

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:15.000
Whatever those traits are
as we marched through,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.210
using these ideas about
individual selection, kin

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:20.410
selection, reciprocal
altruism, you

00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:23.050
could march through
and logically infer

00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:26.060
what the social behavior
of this particular species

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:28.840
was going to be like,
and you would be right.

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:31.780
We saw, for example,
in tournament species,

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:35.500
tournament species where you
have high levels of aggression

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:38.950
among males, male-male
competition for access

00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:39.880
to females.

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:42.780
As a result, males tend to
be a lot bigger than females.

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:45.610
They are being selected
for muscle mass,

00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:48.950
secondary sexual
characteristics, plumage,

00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:51.880
big sharp canines for
slashing the other guy.

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:55.200
Bringing up this issue of,
in a tournament species,

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.250
who does the male
want to mate with?

00:08:57.250 --> 00:09:00.300
What sort of female are males
interested in mating with?

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:01.870
The answer being,
anyone who will

00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:05.030
mate with them because
there's like no cost involved.

00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:08.440
All that's involved is no
parental behavior, none

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:10.190
of that, the cost of sperm.

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:13.020
And literally, people
analyze the relative cost

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:16.260
of sperm versus eggs
in tournament species.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:20.510
Males are dramatically un-choosy
as to who they mate with.

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:23.990
In tournament species, males
have dramatic variability

00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:27.130
in reproductive
success-- 5% accounting

00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:29.240
for 95% of the matings.

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:31.740
Female choice in a
tournament species.

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:33.620
What does a female
want out of a male?

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:36.140
She certainly is not going
to get good fatherhood out

00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:36.650
of the guy.

00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:38.850
All she wants are good
genes because that's

00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:40.810
all she could hope
for from the guy.

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:43.430
A whole world of
female selectivity

00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:46.060
for markers of good genes.

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:48.360
And as we'll see in the
sexual behavior lectures,

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:52.040
a whole world of males
trying to fake out females

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:53.900
across the animal
world, suggesting they

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:56.500
got better genes than
they actually do.

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:58.180
So we will come to that.

00:09:58.180 --> 00:09:59.620
Then tournament species.

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:02.009
Do you see female
abandonment of kids?

00:10:02.009 --> 00:10:04.050
Absolutely not, because
there's nobody else who's

00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:05.340
going to take care of them.

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:07.750
Coupled with that,
you see single births

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:09.830
among those species, low level.

00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:12.150
High levels of aggression
amongst the males,

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:13.810
low levels of parenting.

00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:16.910
And males tend to live a
lot shorter than females.

00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:18.330
And what we saw
at the other end,

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:22.320
the pair-bonded species was a
completely different picture.

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:24.590
Males are being
careful who they're

00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:27.752
mating with because the
wiring there is you mate,

00:10:27.752 --> 00:10:29.400
you take care of the kids.

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:31.560
High levels of male
parenting, females

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:33.510
are thus able to abandon them.

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:35.850
Females can have
multiple births.

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:38.620
Males are selected to
be as close to females

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:39.830
as a male can be.

00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:41.900
So there's not a big
difference in size.

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:44.030
There's not a big difference
in secondary sexual

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:45.010
characteristics.

00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:46.930
There's not high
levels of aggression.

00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:49.030
There's not big
differences in lifespan.

00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:50.940
Who does a female
want to mate with?

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:53.770
Someone who is going to
be a competent father.

00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:56.690
Thus the whole world
of pair-bonded species,

00:10:56.690 --> 00:11:00.360
where males court with
rituals of coming up with food

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:02.310
and coming up with
things of that sort.

00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:04.930
So the most striking thing
about that was, again,

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:07.070
going back to the
two skulls I brought

00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:10.480
in, you could know nothing
more about that species

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:12.560
other than this is
an adult female.

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:13.850
This is an adult male.

00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:15.730
And working through
the same logic,

00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:19.760
you know a huge amount about
the private lives of the species

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:22.040
and who's messing around
with who in the bushes.

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:24.980
And that's merely by
applying these principles.

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:27.200
And likewise saying,
here is a picture

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:29.060
of a pair in this
species and you

00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:31.520
can't tell which one
is who by gender, that

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:33.890
tells you a whole
world of predictability

00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:35.070
at the other end.

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:37.950
So a first example of how
much explanatory power

00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:39.130
you can get out of this.

00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:41.320
And on the website,
I will find all sorts

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:43.710
of appropriate pictures of
tournament and pair-bonding

00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:45.331
species for you to look at.

00:11:45.331 --> 00:11:45.830
OK.

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:48.600
So a first round of
looking at animal behavior

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:51.630
and seeing how once we got
these principles in hand,

00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:54.470
individual selection, kin
selection, reciprocal altruism,

00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:58.140
suddenly an awful lot
of stuff makes sense.

00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:00.080
Next domain where
that's the case.

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:04.160
And this is one that has
had a real challenge to the,

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.440
"Ooh, isn't nature
benign and animals behave

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:08.390
for the good of the
species" viewpoint.

00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:11.930
This one domain probably
proves an individual selection

00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:14.261
framework more than
anything else out there.

00:12:14.261 --> 00:12:14.760
OK.

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:18.290
Back to our inevitable
National Geographic specials.

00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:20.800
And somewhere at the end
of whatever the special is,

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:23.300
about whatever species,
at some point they usually

00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:26.440
get some narrator with some
deep, baritone voice coming

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:28.440
at that stage and
saying something like,

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:31.640
man is the only species
that kills for pleasure.

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:35.330
Man is the only-- and look
at how wonderful and benign

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:36.560
these rosebushes are.

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:37.480
They don't kill.

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:38.610
They don't have war.

00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:39.500
Only humans do.

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:42.480
And what occurred, by
about the mid '70s or so,

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:45.840
was enough field workers from
a different species reporting,

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:46.980
hey, wait a second.

00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:50.080
We're not the only
species that kills.

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:52.010
And we will see
plenty of domains

00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:54.410
where that makes sense
in the lectures to come.

00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:57.150
But one particular
version really,

00:12:57.150 --> 00:13:01.800
really demanded some rethinking
about animal behavior, which

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:02.980
was as follows.

00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:05.930
What is one of the universals,
whether you start with us

00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:08.140
and go all the way
down to slime molds?

00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:10.190
It's babies are cute.

00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:11.520
Everybody likes babies.

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:12.627
Babies are adorable.

00:13:12.627 --> 00:13:13.960
You want to take care of babies.

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:16.410
Your eyes dilate as soon
as you're around them.

00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:20.960
And a longstanding notion that
what infants, what babies,

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:24.080
what baby features are about
are, among other things, are

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:26.350
means to reduce aggression.

00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:29.070
And we will see in the ethology
lecture something about that.

00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:31.600
That was the standard
sound bite forever.

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:34.290
And suddenly, you
got field biologists

00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:36.620
coming back from studying
various species saying,

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:40.390
something's up there,
because in my species

00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:43.730
I see individuals murdering
kids all the time.

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:45.840
Whoa, what's up with that?

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:47.920
Infanticide within a species.

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:51.090
Suddenly, not only are humans
not the only species that

00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:53.220
kills, we're like
not the only one

00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:56.560
who goes and kills adorable,
little, Disney infants.

00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:59.480
Suddenly, all sorts
of species popping up

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:01.400
where there was infanticide.

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:04.640
And the huge challenge then
became to make sense of this.

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:08.850
This first emerged in the
1970s, studies of langur monkeys

00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:12.280
in India by someone named
Sarah Hrdy reporting this.

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:15.260
Soon it was reported among
lions, some other species

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:16.370
as well.

00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:18.990
And the first obvious
response to this was, wait,

00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:21.401
this can't be because I watch
all the wildlife specials.

00:14:21.401 --> 00:14:22.650
There's something [? wrong. ?]

00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:26.080
Oh, there's some sort of
psychopathology going on.

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:28.327
This is not a normal population.

00:14:28.327 --> 00:14:30.160
This is not a normal
population because they

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:31.380
live close to humans.

00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:32.460
There's some disturbance.

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:34.870
There's a toxic
waste dump somewhere.

00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:37.180
They're not a normal
species because you've

00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:40.220
got the wrong color socks on as
the observer, whatever it is.

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:41.510
And this is not normal.

00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:43.630
This is pathological behavior.

00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:46.200
But long enough
time goes by, and it

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:48.420
becomes clear in all
sorts of species,

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:50.590
individuals kill infants.

00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:52.270
So what is this about?

00:14:52.270 --> 00:14:55.830
You start to look closely,
and there's patterns.

00:14:55.830 --> 00:14:57.150
There are patterns to it.

00:14:57.150 --> 00:15:00.080
The first one
being that it tends

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:03.480
to be adult males
who kill infants.

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:05.990
The next being,
you look closely,

00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:09.020
and it's not random
who kills who.

00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:11.580
It's males killing
infants who are

00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:14.640
most likely to be the
offspring of, you guessed it,

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:16.710
individual selection,
most likely to be

00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:19.220
the offspring of other males.

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:22.830
Competitive strategies for
reducing some other guy's

00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:24.940
reproductive success.

00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:27.670
So this began to be seen
in these species that

00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:28.980
had infanticide.

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:33.210
It was male
infanticide of kids who

00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:36.330
were most likely to be the
offspring of other males.

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:39.880
But more patterns popped
up at that time, which is,

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:42.320
well, why don't you see
that in any social species

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:43.610
where you have competition?

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:46.440
And what wound up being
clear after a while is

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:49.800
there's only a certain pattern
that you see in species that

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:54.540
have competitive infanticide,
which is the average interbirth

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:57.450
interval among females is
longer than the average tenure

00:15:57.450 --> 00:15:59.840
of a high-ranking male.

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:00.940
What?

00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:02.240
Here's what that means.

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:04.570
That means you're
some low-ranking guy.

00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:07.380
You've been working out in
the gym for years on end.

00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:10.240
You're finally in the position
to boot out the alpha male

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:11.830
and take over the whole group.

00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:14.277
And damn, every single
female in the group

00:16:14.277 --> 00:16:16.860
has a newborn who they're going
to be nursing for the next two

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:17.550
and a half years.

00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:18.890
So they're not going
to be ovulating,

00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:20.431
and they're not
going to be ovulating

00:16:20.431 --> 00:16:21.350
for about three years.

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:24.520
And you're likely to be alpha
for only a year and a half

00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:27.880
or so, where the length of time,
on average, that you are going

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:30.260
to be able to be
reproductively active

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:32.500
is shorter than
the length of time

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:35.570
that females in your
species nurse kids and thus

00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:36.940
are not ovulating.

00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:40.690
And suddenly, you have
this brutally clear logic

00:16:40.690 --> 00:16:43.290
that makes perfect sense from
everything on Monday, which

00:16:43.290 --> 00:16:46.000
is, go and kill the kids.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.080
Go and kill the kids
for two reasons.

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:52.790
Number one, by killing the
offspring of some other male,

00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:54.530
you are decreasing
that individual's

00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:55.970
reproductive success.

00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:58.450
This competition is leaving
as many copies of your genes,

00:16:58.450 --> 00:16:59.230
et cetera.

00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:02.890
Number two, by killing
an offspring, the female,

00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:05.910
by stopping nursing,
will soon be ovulating.

00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:09.750
And thus, you see this
pattern in langur monkeys,

00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:13.839
vervet monkeys,
patas monkeys, lions,

00:17:13.839 --> 00:17:15.430
mountain gorillas
and such, where

00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:17.119
it's always this structure.

00:17:17.119 --> 00:17:20.720
Competitive infanticide-- a
male takes over a breeding group

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:24.750
and goes about systematically
trying to kill the infants.

00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:28.390
So we've got an enormous
violation there of behavior

00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:31.080
for the good of the species,
and baby animals are cute

00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:33.550
and suppress aggression,
all that sort of thing.

00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:36.730
The clearest demonstration of
that is to look at the fact

00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:39.390
that one of the species
where this goes on

00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:44.110
by this vicious sort of
logic of competition, this

00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:47.010
is one of the species on Earth
that is as close to extinction

00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:49.390
as you can get--
mountain gorillas.

00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:52.050
There's maybe 600,
700 of them are left.

00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:54.980
And these are just
like stunning animals,

00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:58.490
and they are disappearing
because of habitat degradation,

00:17:58.490 --> 00:18:00.360
and human presence,
and civil war

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:02.800
is sweeping through there,
and all that sort of stuff.

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:05.290
But also they are
facing, I think,

00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:08.040
inevitable extinction
in a decade or two

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:11.510
because every now and then,
a male mountain gorilla will

00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:15.290
systematically go and kill
the infants around in a group

00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:16.410
by this logic.

00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:20.390
You can't ask for a much
better demonstration of animals

00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:22.870
not behaving for the
good of the species

00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:27.120
or the group-- this
individual selection strategy.

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:30.150
So immediately we start
applying some rules to this.

00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:35.040
Well, when's a circumstance that
a male would come into a group

00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:37.870
and boot out the previous
reproductive male

00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:40.950
and take over, and
where he wouldn't

00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:44.390
be all that fast to try to kill
all the infants in the group?

00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:46.360
When would a male
take over a group

00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:49.780
and not be all that thrilled to
do this competitive infanticide

00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:51.080
strategy?

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:52.420
Any guesses?

00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:53.690
When he's a brother.

00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:54.860
Yeah.

00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:58.830
Part two, individual
selection, kin selection.

00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:02.570
Kin selection, you don't see
the competitive infanticide

00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:06.730
if the males replacing are
close relatives by exactly

00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:08.210
that logic.

00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:11.870
So then you begin to see some
more elegant stuff going on.

00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:14.880
In some cases, in
a bunch of species,

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:17.870
instead of males killing
infants, what happens

00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:20.800
is the presence of
a new male causes

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:24.430
females to miscarry,
pregnant females to miscarry.

00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:28.200
One version of this, and
this is seen in wild horses,

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:31.460
the new male in there
harasses pregnant females

00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:33.890
to the point of
them miscarrying.

00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:36.140
Same exact logic again.

00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:38.550
In a whole bunch
of rodent species,

00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:40.750
you see something
far more elegant.

00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:44.610
The new male shows up, and if
you were a pregnant female,

00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:49.770
the smell of a new male causes
you to miscarry a litter.

00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:51.780
And the biology
that is completely

00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:54.660
worked out, going from
the olfactory signaling--

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:57.200
and we're going to hear tons
about olfactory signaling

00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:00.120
in weeks to come-- going
from the olfactory system

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:03.250
to release of a
stress hormone that

00:20:03.250 --> 00:20:06.420
disrupts uterine
maturation, and you abort.

00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:09.180
Olfaction-induced abortion.

00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:11.060
What's up with the
female with that?

00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:13.310
Why is that a strategy
for her to leave

00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:16.210
as many copies of her own
genes in the next generation?

00:20:16.210 --> 00:20:19.170
If this guy is around, she's
got a choice at that point,

00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:21.510
a choice, again, metaphorically.

00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:23.030
She has a choice at that point.

00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:26.130
Either she can go through the
rest of the metabolic costs

00:20:26.130 --> 00:20:28.070
of pregnancy, give
birth to these kids,

00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:29.280
and then they get killed.

00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:32.320
Or at least she can take
the lesser of two evils.

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:34.860
[? He ?] spontaneously
aborts at that point.

00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:38.300
And soon after, she is
ovulating and has a chance

00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:41.370
again to pass on copies
of her own genes.

00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:45.040
And this is the whole world
of-- you put a male hamster

00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:47.100
in with a female
who's just had babies,

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:48.730
and he goes and eats the kids.

00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:50.300
Oh, it's psychopathological.

00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:51.800
It's not psychopathological.

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:53.760
Male hamsters are migratory.

00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:57.110
If there are kids there, they're
not likely to have been mine.

00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:58.430
That's the logical thing.

00:20:58.430 --> 00:21:01.440
Females having been
selected for if there

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:05.650
is the smell of a
new male, miscarry.

00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:08.740
And the same logic again
extending, the smell

00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:11.990
of a new male, unless
he's a close relative

00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:13.340
of the previous male.

00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:16.930
You see the exact same
thing playing out there.

00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:20.560
Now, all of this, of course,
is very sort of male-biased

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:21.360
in terms of this.

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:25.170
These are females sort of making
the best of the bad situation.

00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:27.140
You're some female
langur monkey,

00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:29.160
and some new male
has come in and is

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:30.980
intent on being infanticidal.

00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:34.050
And you've read
evolutionary biology also.

00:21:34.050 --> 00:21:36.090
What do you want
to do to maximize

00:21:36.090 --> 00:21:39.300
copies of your own genes
in the next generation?

00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:43.580
Well, you've got this kid here
who you're trying to protect.

00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:47.480
Would you protect that child to
the point of your being killed?

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:48.570
Probably not.

00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:51.210
And you don't see
females doing that.

00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:53.730
Under what circumstance
would a female

00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:57.410
be most motivated to defend
her child to the point of her

00:21:57.410 --> 00:21:59.060
being seriously injured?

00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:01.510
Older females, older
females who are

00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:05.370
less likely to have
another child after that.

00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:08.640
You're on the scene there,
and who else from day one

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:10.740
would be most willing
to get injured

00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:12.550
in order to protect the kid?

00:22:12.550 --> 00:22:16.630
The maternal grandmother, who
has no reproductive potential

00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:17.350
at that point.

00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:19.895
And what you see in
these langur monkeys,

00:22:19.895 --> 00:22:24.150
the females will defend, not
to the point of serious injury.

00:22:24.150 --> 00:22:27.470
The older the mother is, the
more strenuously she defends,

00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:29.810
and the grandmothers
defend even more.

00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:33.890
Following the same logic
here playing out in that way.

00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:36.470
But you also have
another option,

00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:38.820
which is to do something
much more clever.

00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:40.720
And this is not in
the world after you've

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:43.680
given birth, but the world
of when you are pregnant.

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:45.100
Because even in
these species that

00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:47.440
have the competitive
infanticide,

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:49.940
the new male was also
perfectly happy to harass

00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:51.210
a pregnant female.

00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:54.660
What have females evolved in
a number of primate species?

00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:58.550
One of the great, all-time
ways of manipulating males.

00:22:58.550 --> 00:23:00.810
So you're this
pregnant langur monkey,

00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:03.340
and in comes this new male.

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:05.280
And you know you're
going to go through

00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:07.060
like six more
weeks of pregnancy,

00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:08.810
and they're going to
be enormously costly,

00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:10.640
and the damn guy is
going to kill your kids

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:11.730
as soon as they're born.

00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:14.010
And what can you
do and all of that?

00:23:14.010 --> 00:23:17.250
And you come up with something
very clever physiologically.

00:23:17.250 --> 00:23:22.460
You go into what is called
pseudo-estrus, estrus being

00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:25.390
the term for when female
primates are ovulating

00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:27.650
or sexually receptive,
are in heat.

00:23:27.650 --> 00:23:30.360
And most primate species
give external signs

00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:31.530
of when they're ovulating.

00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:33.550
There is engorgement
of all sorts

00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:36.830
of tissues around the vagina
and rear end and stuff

00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:37.970
that humans don't do.

00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:40.640
But they have some of the
physiological residues,

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:42.810
of water retention, for example.

00:23:42.810 --> 00:23:46.424
So you've got all these external
signs of, I am ovulating,

00:23:46.424 --> 00:23:48.590
except you're not ovulating
because you're pregnant.

00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:50.350
You are pseudo-ovulating.

00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:52.610
You are going through
a pseudo-estrus.

00:23:52.610 --> 00:23:54.580
You generate the picture of it.

00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:57.410
So what happens at that
point with this new guy who's

00:23:57.410 --> 00:24:00.560
just shown up, and here's this
like four-month pregnant female

00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:02.810
who nonetheless looks like
she's going through estrus?

00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:05.730
Well, these guys sit there
then and say, well, well,

00:24:05.730 --> 00:24:08.110
that's kind of nice, and
they go and mate with her.

00:24:08.110 --> 00:24:10.744
And like two and a half
weeks later, she gives birth.

00:24:10.744 --> 00:24:12.410
And you know what the
guy's going to do.

00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:14.650
He's going to sit there and
say, what's the gestation period

00:24:14.650 --> 00:24:15.250
in my species?

00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:16.054
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:16.054 --> 00:24:19.770
[INAUDIBLE], what is it, like
five months or something?

00:24:19.770 --> 00:24:24.080
I've been here three weeks,
and already she's given birth.

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:24.940
Whoa, what a guy.

00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:26.110
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:26.110 --> 00:24:27.420
And they fall for it.

00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:29.040
They fall for it every time.

00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:31.900
Females, by having these
pseudo-estrus things,

00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:34.890
the males are not
infanticidal afterward

00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:36.880
when the female gives birth.

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:38.730
So this whole world
that initially

00:24:38.730 --> 00:24:41.790
makes no sense at
all-- oh, my god,

00:24:41.790 --> 00:24:44.640
animals killing members of
their own species, even babies,

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:47.450
making vicious logic
when applying issues

00:24:47.450 --> 00:24:50.990
of individual selection
and the qualifications

00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:52.500
by way of kin selection.

00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:55.700
Next example, another one
with a similar flavor.

00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:57.048
And yeah?

00:24:57.048 --> 00:25:01.420
Wouldn't evolution favor a male
that he didn't figure it out

00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:03.240
that it was his children?

00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:03.780
Yep.

00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:06.980
And I think probably the
most technical, Darwinian way

00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:09.920
of explaining that is the
well-known propensity of blood

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:12.470
flow to either go to
male brains or penises.

00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:15.270
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:15.270 --> 00:25:17.480
They just get impulsive
at that point.

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:21.010
They don't stop to think and
get the gynecology textbook.

00:25:21.010 --> 00:25:23.780
That there no doubt
is an advantage

00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:26.210
for the tiny subset
of male langur monkeys

00:25:26.210 --> 00:25:29.240
who can actually be like
prudent at that point

00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:31.440
and think through the logic.

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:33.610
It works with males.

00:25:33.610 --> 00:25:35.760
They fall for it.

00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:38.230
Suggesting that a lot
of what's going on there

00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:40.890
is not a conscious,
cognitive strategy.

00:25:40.890 --> 00:25:43.410
And this is sort of not
a facetious answer, when

00:25:43.410 --> 00:25:45.650
by the end of next week,
we get to looking at,

00:25:45.650 --> 00:25:48.720
how do animals
recognize individuals?

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:51.632
With a lot of species, there's
not a cognitive strategy.

00:25:51.632 --> 00:25:54.090
You're not able to sit there
and figure out, wait a second,

00:25:54.090 --> 00:25:55.440
this isn't making any sense.

00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:55.940
No.

00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:59.097
I mean, like not that
logically figure it out,

00:25:59.097 --> 00:26:01.532
but [INAUDIBLE]
just favor the males

00:26:01.532 --> 00:26:04.454
that, for any reason,
whether they figure it out,

00:26:04.454 --> 00:26:08.187
they just feel like
[INAUDIBLE] three weeks instead

00:26:08.187 --> 00:26:12.060
of five months [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:13.980
I think what it is
is that there's not

00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:16.230
a whole lot of males
there who could make sense

00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:19.260
or who have been selected
for making sense of the fact

00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:21.450
that mating has something
to do with babies down

00:26:21.450 --> 00:26:23.220
at the other end of things.

00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:25.560
I think there's not been
much selection for being

00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:27.200
able to cognitively do that.

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:31.610
Or to have some sort of rule--
if I mate with this individual,

00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:34.479
any time she
produces a baby, I'm

00:26:34.479 --> 00:26:36.020
going to be unaggressive
to the baby,

00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:38.230
unless it's within
this sort of time span.

00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:40.530
I think that's a little too
much, too fast, [? too ?]

00:26:40.530 --> 00:26:43.320
evolved in sort of
a primate system.

00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:45.540
The males fall for it.

00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:48.000
Another version with a
lot of the same logic.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.700
And this became clear-- studies
of baboons, Savannah baboons,

00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:54.200
in the early '60s,
which is you would

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:56.390
have some male,
who male was having

00:26:56.390 --> 00:26:58.180
a tension with
another adult male.

00:26:58.180 --> 00:27:00.630
And they're about to have
some sort of clear fight,

00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:03.639
and one guy is
obviously low ranking,

00:27:03.639 --> 00:27:04.930
and he's going to get trounced.

00:27:04.930 --> 00:27:07.260
And here comes the
big, high-ranking male,

00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:08.420
and this guy is terrified.

00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:09.940
And what does he do?

00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:13.310
He looks around frantically
and grabs a baby

00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:16.170
and holds it to his chest.

00:27:16.170 --> 00:27:18.460
1950s National
Geographic special.

00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:19.700
Why is he doing that?

00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:23.950
Because infants are comforting,
because babies are cute.

00:27:23.950 --> 00:27:25.780
And everybody becomes
less aggressive

00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:27.830
when there's a baby
around, because oh, my god,

00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:29.663
who would attack somebody
holding an infant?

00:27:29.663 --> 00:27:30.950
What if the infant's injured?

00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:31.560
OK.

00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:33.900
So that's the old version.

00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:36.690
So applying some
contemporary interpretations,

00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:39.910
what you wind up seeing, along
comes the threatening male.

00:27:39.910 --> 00:27:43.610
The subordinate male grabs
an infant and holds it.

00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:46.790
And what you only begin to
see after a while of studying

00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:51.050
individuals is, it's not
random which infant he grabs.

00:27:51.050 --> 00:27:52.590
And you know
exactly what's going

00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:54.450
to come next, a
very similar theme

00:27:54.450 --> 00:27:56.250
to the competitive infanticide.

00:27:56.250 --> 00:27:59.670
When males are doing
"kidnapping" like this,

00:27:59.670 --> 00:28:01.380
and that is the
term to use, they're

00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:03.390
not randomly grabbing kids.

00:28:03.390 --> 00:28:06.000
They're grabbing kids
who are likely to be

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.810
the offspring of that male.

00:28:07.810 --> 00:28:10.990
And it is very clear at
that point, mess with me,

00:28:10.990 --> 00:28:13.079
and your kid's going to get it.

00:28:13.079 --> 00:28:14.620
And it's clearly
not being played out

00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:16.870
in any sort of conscious
level like that.

00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:20.350
But what you see
is, it's not random.

00:28:20.350 --> 00:28:22.600
And it comes with the
sort of qualifiers

00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:25.770
that show you even more
how the system is working.

00:28:25.770 --> 00:28:29.590
So you've got some guy who's
a big, high-ranking male

00:28:29.590 --> 00:28:32.390
and has obviously fathered all
sorts of kids in the troop.

00:28:32.390 --> 00:28:34.460
And you're about to
trounce this smaller

00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:36.970
guy who grabs one of the kids
who's more likely to be his

00:28:36.970 --> 00:28:37.800
than yours.

00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:41.690
Logical competitive strategy
of essentially blackmail.

00:28:41.690 --> 00:28:44.430
You've got a big,
high-ranking male

00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:46.850
who's dominating everybody
else, except he only

00:28:46.850 --> 00:28:49.070
joined the troop two weeks ago.

00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:51.110
In other words, there's
not been enough time

00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:53.130
for him to have kids yet.

00:28:53.130 --> 00:28:55.430
When he is threatening
lower-ranking guys,

00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:58.100
they're less likely
to kidnap against him

00:28:58.100 --> 00:29:00.250
than kidnap against
the high-ranking male

00:29:00.250 --> 00:29:02.520
with a long residency.

00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:04.660
And what you find
even more interesting,

00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:06.890
which throws you into
this world of, well,

00:29:06.890 --> 00:29:09.330
are these guys consciously
thinking about this,

00:29:09.330 --> 00:29:14.360
or do they just smell that
that kid is that guy's kid,

00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:15.780
and do they just know?

00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:18.260
In primates, they're
thinking about it.

00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:20.490
And the way to realize
that is when they

00:29:20.490 --> 00:29:23.090
screw up and make a mistake.

00:29:23.090 --> 00:29:26.670
And this one, sort of years ago
I was watching some baboons,

00:29:26.670 --> 00:29:28.265
and there was this
low-ranking guy.

00:29:28.265 --> 00:29:30.640
He was actually middle ranking,
and this high-ranking guy

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:31.750
was coming at him.

00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:35.200
And he was a middle-ranking guy
who critically was on his way

00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:35.700
down.

00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:37.660
He used to be a
high-ranking guy.

00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:38.870
He was aging.

00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:42.250
In other words, he used to
be reproductively active.

00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:45.480
In other words, there's some of
his kids around in the troop.

00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:47.150
So he's sitting
there, and here comes

00:29:47.150 --> 00:29:50.520
this terrifying, high-ranking
male who's coming at him.

00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:53.850
And our guy gets all agitated,
nervous, looks around,

00:29:53.850 --> 00:29:57.220
and he grabs a kid, and
it's likely to be his kid.

00:29:57.220 --> 00:29:58.584
He's grabbed his own kid.

00:29:58.584 --> 00:30:00.250
Oh, my god, you're
sitting there saying,

00:30:00.250 --> 00:30:02.291
I'm never going to get a
damn thesis out of this.

00:30:02.291 --> 00:30:04.890
These animals just ruined
all the theoretical models.

00:30:04.890 --> 00:30:06.397
He's grabbing the wrong kid.

00:30:06.397 --> 00:30:08.730
So he's holding the kid there,
and you're sitting there.

00:30:08.730 --> 00:30:12.220
And you could see the guy's
about five steps away, and he--

00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:14.460
so he tosses the
kid in the air--

00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:14.960
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:16.460
--just as he's attacked.

00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:20.640
You will see they act as if
they have made a mistake.

00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:23.670
They are consciously working
around something like this.

00:30:23.670 --> 00:30:28.630
So this whole notion of coercive
blackmail and kidnapping,

00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:31.190
again, it only
makes sense once you

00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:34.320
begin to see the structures
of individual selection, kin

00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:36.610
selection, reciprocal altruism.

00:30:36.610 --> 00:30:40.810
Another example, and this one
makes perfect sense instantly.

00:30:40.810 --> 00:30:43.480
You look at the world
of female primates

00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:46.880
in lots of different species,
and there's ranking systems.

00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:48.030
There is a hierarchy.

00:30:48.030 --> 00:30:50.150
And what's the
hierarchy built around?

00:30:50.150 --> 00:30:53.740
You get a rank one below
that of your mother.

00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:55.540
You inherit your rank.

00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:57.550
Your mom is the alpha female.

00:30:57.550 --> 00:31:00.580
You're her first daughter,
so you're number two.

00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:02.930
And as soon as she
has another daughter,

00:31:02.930 --> 00:31:05.380
your kid sister is
number three, until you

00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:08.120
have a first daughter, who
pushes your kid sister down

00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:08.840
one step.

00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:10.940
In other words,
dominance hierarchies

00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:14.080
amongst the females are
entirely nepotistic.

00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:14.850
Whoa.

00:31:14.850 --> 00:31:17.095
How can you explain that?

00:31:17.095 --> 00:31:19.710
Part number two, kin selection.

00:31:19.710 --> 00:31:22.960
Dominance systems in all
sorts of social species

00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:26.080
are built around the
nepotism of relatedness.

00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:28.180
So that makes sense.

00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:31.210
Next one, next
interesting notion here,

00:31:31.210 --> 00:31:34.140
which is one of those
choices, one of those choices

00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:35.640
that are not conscious choices.

00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:37.280
But you're about
to get pregnant,

00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:40.150
and you have a choice, as
whatever species you are,

00:31:40.150 --> 00:31:42.514
do you want to have
a male or a female,

00:31:42.514 --> 00:31:44.680
or do you want to have a
litter of males or females,

00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:46.721
or do you want have a
litter that's predominantly

00:31:46.721 --> 00:31:48.080
male or predominantly female?

00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:51.780
And it comes down to an issue
now of two things, which

00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:56.450
is, how much does it cost to
have a female versus a male

00:31:56.450 --> 00:31:57.720
during pregnancy?

00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:00.570
And what are the
reproductive probabilities

00:32:00.570 --> 00:32:02.770
of having a male
versus a female?

00:32:02.770 --> 00:32:03.730
Back to this issue.

00:32:03.730 --> 00:32:06.040
You are in a big
tournament species.

00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:09.360
And as we saw, there's high
degrees of male variability

00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:10.950
in reproductive success.

00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:16.500
5% of the guys are accounting
for 95% of the matings.

00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:19.030
So you sit there,
and what you've got

00:32:19.030 --> 00:32:24.180
is a rule that if you go for a
son-- like 90% of sons running

00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:26.130
around there are never
going to reproduce.

00:32:26.130 --> 00:32:29.340
And you hit the jackpot and you
have the 5% at the very top,

00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:31.370
and each of them are
going to like father

00:32:31.370 --> 00:32:35.600
30 different kids, going for
males in a tournament species

00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:37.270
is a big gamble.

00:32:37.270 --> 00:32:39.390
It's a risky move.

00:32:39.390 --> 00:32:41.350
Going for a female,
however, there

00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:43.920
is no female primate
out there who

00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:48.060
has 420 kids because she
lays eggs like a salmon.

00:32:48.060 --> 00:32:50.910
Most females there, unless they
have some fertility problem,

00:32:50.910 --> 00:32:53.730
they all have something
roughly one to five kids

00:32:53.730 --> 00:32:57.210
or so over the course of the
life of an old-world primate.

00:32:57.210 --> 00:32:59.830
So female variability
is way down.

00:32:59.830 --> 00:33:03.250
In other words, what's
a conservative strategy

00:33:03.250 --> 00:33:04.920
to pass on copies of your genes?

00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:06.050
Have a daughter.

00:33:06.050 --> 00:33:08.020
What's a riskier strategy?

00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:09.460
Have a son.

00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:13.050
And what that immediately
predicts is two things.

00:33:13.050 --> 00:33:16.150
Number one, you look in
dominance hierarchies,

00:33:16.150 --> 00:33:19.960
and the prediction is that
females who are high ranking

00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:22.990
should show more of a
tendency towards having sons

00:33:22.990 --> 00:33:24.110
than daughters.

00:33:24.110 --> 00:33:27.830
And females who are low
ranking, exactly the opposite.

00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:31.190
And that's what you see in
a bunch of primate species

00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:33.390
that have this
sort of structure.

00:33:33.390 --> 00:33:35.020
Next prediction.

00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:39.210
You should then predict that
when ecological circumstances

00:33:39.210 --> 00:33:42.470
get tough, when
times are tough, you

00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:45.260
want to go for the
offspring that costs less.

00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:47.560
A female fetus is
less calorically

00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:49.320
demanding than a male fetus.

00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:53.370
Male fetuses cost more to
bring to term than females do.

00:33:53.370 --> 00:33:57.320
The prediction should be, during
times of ecological pressure,

00:33:57.320 --> 00:34:01.010
the percentage of females
being born should increase.

00:34:01.010 --> 00:34:02.960
And as a measure of
the fact that males

00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:05.150
are more expensive
as fetuses, something

00:34:05.150 --> 00:34:09.020
like 53% of
fertilizations in humans

00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:13.239
are males, about a
53% to 47% ratio.

00:34:13.239 --> 00:34:15.219
And over the course
of pregnancy,

00:34:15.219 --> 00:34:18.230
the cost, the increased
metabolic vulnerability

00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:21.650
of male fetuses, are such that
by the time birth comes around,

00:34:21.650 --> 00:34:23.820
it's around 51-49.

00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:26.300
And it's not until
adolescence that it flips over

00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:28.960
to the typical pattern
of female dominance.

00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:31.170
You've got to have
more male fetuses

00:34:31.170 --> 00:34:33.739
to start off with because
they are more expensive, more

00:34:33.739 --> 00:34:34.650
vulnerable.

00:34:34.650 --> 00:34:38.030
So this prediction during
times of ecological duress,

00:34:38.030 --> 00:34:40.860
you should get a bias
towards more females

00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:44.350
being born, the 50/50 ratio
skewing in that direction.

00:34:44.350 --> 00:34:47.340
And that's precisely
what you wind up seeing.

00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:49.750
And you see all sorts
of examples of this.

00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:53.790
In humans, for example,
during periods of famine,

00:34:53.790 --> 00:34:57.470
food deprivation, the ratio of
births skew towards females.

00:34:57.470 --> 00:35:01.480
What you also see as a measure
of that is among humans,

00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:06.370
a boy, giving birth to a
boy, statistically decreases

00:35:06.370 --> 00:35:08.760
the body weight, is likely
to decrease the body

00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:10.360
weight, of the next offspring.

00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:13.300
It's expensive having
one of those males.

00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:14.950
And what you wind
up getting, then,

00:35:14.950 --> 00:35:19.140
is fluctuation as a function
of your dominance rank.

00:35:19.140 --> 00:35:21.620
If you're high ranking,
it's almost always

00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:24.720
worth the gamble to go for one
of those high-risk, high-payoff

00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:25.480
boys.

00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:28.020
If you're low ranking, go
for the far more conservative

00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:28.860
female.

00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:32.576
You've got this fluctuation
around this 50-50 ratio.

00:35:32.576 --> 00:35:33.950
And this was
something worked out

00:35:33.950 --> 00:35:36.669
by one of the sort
of founding figures

00:35:36.669 --> 00:35:38.710
[? just through ?] modern
evolutionary thinking--

00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:41.760
a guy named Robert
Trivers in the 1970s,

00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:45.900
sex ratio fluctuation as a
function of social context.

00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:49.890
And people have gone and
looked, and it's precisely this.

00:35:49.890 --> 00:35:52.140
And you get an interesting
bit of conservatism

00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:55.970
in this, though, which is
there's some circumstance where

00:35:55.970 --> 00:35:59.080
it makes perfect sense for
you to have a gazillion

00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:01.290
daughters because that's
the time to do it.

00:36:01.290 --> 00:36:03.905
And at some point, you're
having a gazillion daughters,

00:36:03.905 --> 00:36:06.030
and everybody else is having
a gazillion daughters.

00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:09.750
And suddenly, males become
really valuable because there's

00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:11.160
not a whole lot of them around.

00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:12.590
So the logical
thing to do then is

00:36:12.590 --> 00:36:14.490
to switch over and
start having males.

00:36:14.490 --> 00:36:16.705
And everything else being
equal, after a while,

00:36:16.705 --> 00:36:18.900
with a predominance of
males, it's going to make

00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:20.680
sense to switch over to females.

00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:24.460
You have density-dependent
selection you will always

00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:27.620
have oscillating around 50%.

00:36:27.620 --> 00:36:31.040
Whichever sex is in
the smaller number,

00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:33.740
that one is immediately
more preferable.

00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:36.390
Poor ecological conditions
pushes you this way.

00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:38.670
Dominance rank push you
one way or the other.

00:36:38.670 --> 00:36:40.140
But in any of those
circumstances,

00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:42.450
you have an oscillation
around the mean.

00:36:42.450 --> 00:36:45.810
Whichever is more common
is less desirable.

00:36:45.810 --> 00:36:48.300
So sex ratio fluctuation.

00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:49.450
More stuff.

00:36:49.450 --> 00:36:52.770
Role of kinship, for
example, in vervet monkeys.

00:36:52.770 --> 00:36:54.700
We talked about
that the other day.

00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:57.290
Play the sound, an
infant alarm call,

00:36:57.290 --> 00:36:59.710
and the mother
gets all agitated,

00:36:59.710 --> 00:37:01.980
and everyone else
looks at the mother.

00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:03.370
They know that
she is the mother.

00:37:03.370 --> 00:37:06.380
Sort of demonstration of
awareness of kinship there.

00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:09.850
Now, another very
interesting social structure

00:37:09.850 --> 00:37:13.690
to some species, which is we've
seen all of these tournament

00:37:13.690 --> 00:37:14.650
species.

00:37:14.650 --> 00:37:18.950
You have one high-ranking male
mating with lots of females

00:37:18.950 --> 00:37:22.170
and all that sort of stuff
and polygamous systems.

00:37:22.170 --> 00:37:25.270
What about polyandry--
circumstances

00:37:25.270 --> 00:37:28.460
where a female is mating
with multiple males?

00:37:28.460 --> 00:37:31.660
What about circumstances
of stable polyandry,

00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:34.590
where you get, in effect,
the inverse of a harem?

00:37:34.590 --> 00:37:38.680
You get a single breeding
female with a number of males?

00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:42.260
And what is seen with a
very, very high predominance

00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:45.930
is when polyandry occurs,
you get a type which

00:37:45.930 --> 00:37:49.270
is called adelphic polyandry.

00:37:49.270 --> 00:37:51.480
And the second I
tell what it is,

00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:53.630
it will make perfect,
wonderful sense.

00:37:53.630 --> 00:37:54.140
OK.

00:37:54.140 --> 00:37:57.770
Two male lions sharing a pride?

00:37:57.770 --> 00:37:59.640
That's like not what
you're supposed to see.

00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:04.170
It's one male lion, and
Mufasa and his, like, brother

00:38:04.170 --> 00:38:05.220
gets pushed out of there.

00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:06.594
And like, that's
not what you see

00:38:06.594 --> 00:38:08.080
when you study Disney lions.

00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:09.580
There's supposed
to be only one male

00:38:09.580 --> 00:38:11.120
is the breeder in the pride.

00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:13.160
And occasionally
you see these prides

00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:14.910
where instead there
were two males.

00:38:14.910 --> 00:38:16.910
How can they pull that off?

00:38:16.910 --> 00:38:19.880
They should be doing competitive
infanticide, all of that.

00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:21.630
Who were the two males?

00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:24.870
Yes, you guessed it
somewhere up there before.

00:38:24.870 --> 00:38:26.650
It'll be two brothers.

00:38:26.650 --> 00:38:31.190
When you see cases of two
male lions sharing a pride,

00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:33.540
or flip the other
way, when you see

00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:36.150
a pride being willing to
tolerate two males in there

00:38:36.150 --> 00:38:39.150
instead of one, very,
very high likelihood

00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:40.430
that they are brothers.

00:38:40.430 --> 00:38:43.580
This technical term--
"adelphic polyandry."

00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:47.200
And you wind up seeing
one totally wild example

00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:49.350
of this in humans.

00:38:49.350 --> 00:38:52.219
As I went over the other
day, looking at our humans,

00:38:52.219 --> 00:38:54.010
tournament species,
[? the ?] pair bonding.

00:38:54.010 --> 00:38:55.384
We're somewhere
stuck in between.

00:38:55.384 --> 00:38:56.740
We're terribly confused.

00:38:56.740 --> 00:39:00.655
What you see is most cultures
traditionally allow polygamy,

00:39:00.655 --> 00:39:03.030
but most people are not actually
polygamous, all of that.

00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:05.404
And somewhere in there, you
got to ask the same question.

00:39:05.404 --> 00:39:09.000
Hey, is there any polyandry
going on with humans?

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:12.440
And there is one wild
cultural example of this.

00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:15.840
And this is seen in
traditional Tibetan society,

00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:19.520
and there you get
adelphic polyandry.

00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:22.530
You have the following
structure in rural areas.

00:39:22.530 --> 00:39:25.020
A woman will marry a man.

00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:26.650
And in the process,
she will marry

00:39:26.650 --> 00:39:29.950
him along with all of his
brothers, all his brothers.

00:39:29.950 --> 00:39:32.240
She marries the
entire lot of them.

00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:34.350
It is adelphic polyandry.

00:39:34.350 --> 00:39:35.340
And you see that.

00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:37.160
And like it's down
to the point where

00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:39.340
here's this woman
with her husband

00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:41.340
and his younger brother
and his younger brother,

00:39:41.340 --> 00:39:43.090
all the way down to
this infant that she's

00:39:43.090 --> 00:39:45.310
holding, who's the
youngest brother who's

00:39:45.310 --> 00:39:46.690
now one of her husbands.

00:39:46.690 --> 00:39:48.640
And that's what you see.

00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:50.285
What's the explanation for this?

00:39:50.285 --> 00:39:53.660
This is a pattern that
you get in agriculturally

00:39:53.660 --> 00:39:56.710
very impoverished areas
where you got a problem.

00:39:56.710 --> 00:39:59.020
You've got five
sons or whatever.

00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:01.590
And with a pattern
of land inheritance

00:40:01.590 --> 00:40:04.760
where you would otherwise split
up the land amongst the five

00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:06.750
sons, that's going
to put each of them

00:40:06.750 --> 00:40:08.380
below subsistence level.

00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:11.190
What you need to do is
have a way in which they

00:40:11.190 --> 00:40:15.160
remain as one reproductive unit
so you don't split up the land.

00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:18.760
You see this adelphic
polyandry, a woman marrying

00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:20.940
this whole bunch of brothers.

00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:22.900
And it's in
circumstances where it's

00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:25.910
trying to keep the small farm
plots from being broken up.

00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:28.790
But again, the logic
there is the same

00:40:28.790 --> 00:40:32.920
as you see in lions with two
brothers sharing a pride.

00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:33.900
What else?

00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:35.810
Now, somewhere in
there, you begin

00:40:35.810 --> 00:40:38.640
to get in a realization
that not only do

00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:41.740
you have males competing with
males for reproductive success

00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:43.680
and females with
females, but there's

00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:46.240
intersexual competition.

00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:47.620
How could this be?

00:40:47.620 --> 00:40:50.020
How could a planet that
comes up with Valentine's Day

00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:51.880
have intersexual competition?

00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:55.240
What is obvious is the
reproductive interests

00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:57.720
of any given
individual may not be

00:40:57.720 --> 00:40:59.640
exactly the same
as the individual

00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:01.850
she or he mates with.

00:41:01.850 --> 00:41:04.330
What would be an
example of this?

00:41:04.330 --> 00:41:09.420
Here you have a species in
which males are migratory.

00:41:09.420 --> 00:41:11.010
It's a tournament species.

00:41:11.010 --> 00:41:14.650
A male shows up during a mating
season, lots of aggression,

00:41:14.650 --> 00:41:16.610
lots of secondary
sexual whatever.

00:41:16.610 --> 00:41:19.670
And he mates with a
female, and she has kids.

00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:21.140
Hooray.

00:41:21.140 --> 00:41:25.030
They have parented an offspring,
and they've shared their genes

00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:26.840
and increased their
reproductive success.

00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:29.010
Except this being
the species, this guy

00:41:29.010 --> 00:41:31.950
is going to pack up
and leave the next day.

00:41:31.950 --> 00:41:34.990
In other words, he
has no investment

00:41:34.990 --> 00:41:37.620
in the future reproductive
health of that female,

00:41:37.620 --> 00:41:39.810
whereas she sure does.

00:41:39.810 --> 00:41:42.440
She would be delighted
for this offspring

00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:46.140
to thrive and prosper, but
perhaps not at the cost

00:41:46.140 --> 00:41:47.940
of her future reproduction.

00:41:47.940 --> 00:41:50.840
What we see here is, between
the male and the female,

00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:53.090
different reproductive
strategies.

00:41:53.090 --> 00:41:56.400
And this opens up a
whole bizarre world

00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:59.360
of intersexual competition.

00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:02.370
Here's one really bizarre
manifestation of this.

00:42:02.370 --> 00:42:02.870
OK.

00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:04.940
Basic Mendelian genetics.

00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:06.896
Those of you who got
the catch-up this week

00:42:06.896 --> 00:42:08.270
should have a
vague sense of this

00:42:08.270 --> 00:42:10.610
by now, Hardy-Weinberg ratios.

00:42:10.610 --> 00:42:14.440
You've got one parent
has one genotype,

00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:17.890
just to distinguish the parents
and changes the colors there,

00:42:17.890 --> 00:42:18.510
all of that.

00:42:18.510 --> 00:42:21.970
What is it that isn't bothered
with from day one when you

00:42:21.970 --> 00:42:23.836
learn these sorts of things?

00:42:23.836 --> 00:42:25.460
It doesn't matter
which one is the male

00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:26.980
and which is the female,
which is the father

00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:28.260
and which is the mother.

00:42:28.260 --> 00:42:30.320
This is just one
of them contributes

00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:31.790
this profile, one that.

00:42:31.790 --> 00:42:33.450
What pops out the other side?

00:42:33.450 --> 00:42:35.570
Basic Mendelian genetics.

00:42:35.570 --> 00:42:37.480
When making sense
of pedigrees, it

00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:39.770
doesn't matter which
parent is contributing

00:42:39.770 --> 00:42:42.380
the homozygotic profile,
the heterozygotic.

00:42:42.380 --> 00:42:44.530
It doesn't matter which parent.

00:42:44.530 --> 00:42:48.900
But then, there is a whole
world of genetic traits

00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:52.450
where, in fact, it does matter
which parent it comes from,

00:42:52.450 --> 00:42:56.430
because the same
combination of alleles

00:42:56.430 --> 00:42:59.610
will function differently
whether it came from the mother

00:42:59.610 --> 00:43:01.330
or from the father.

00:43:01.330 --> 00:43:05.100
And this was a field that sort
of emerged in the early 1990s,

00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:09.340
and these are called imprinted
genes, imprinted genes.

00:43:09.340 --> 00:43:12.410
These are genes where, for
our purposes to define them,

00:43:12.410 --> 00:43:16.370
these are genes which have
different manifestations,

00:43:16.370 --> 00:43:18.410
different phenotypic
consequences.

00:43:18.410 --> 00:43:21.250
These are genes that work
differently depending

00:43:21.250 --> 00:43:23.800
on which parent they came from.

00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:26.450
Mendel rolling in his grave.

00:43:26.450 --> 00:43:28.480
This is not how it's
supposed to work.

00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:32.690
This obscure world of
imprinted genes violates this.

00:43:32.690 --> 00:43:35.450
They work differently
depending on which parent

00:43:35.450 --> 00:43:37.140
you get it from.

00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:41.080
Dramatic foreshadowing-- when
we get to the ethology lecture,

00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:43.110
the word "imprinting" is
going to come up again

00:43:43.110 --> 00:43:44.530
in a totally different sense.

00:43:44.530 --> 00:43:47.080
This is a purely
molecular term right now.

00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:47.580
OK.

00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:51.250
So you get imprinted
genes, imprinted genes.

00:43:51.250 --> 00:43:53.690
People began to figure
this out in the '90s,

00:43:53.690 --> 00:43:57.220
that, wait a second, we've got
a completely different profile

00:43:57.220 --> 00:43:58.970
in these individuals
with a mutation

00:43:58.970 --> 00:44:00.680
and a particular disease.

00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:02.980
Here we have these two
very different diseases,

00:44:02.980 --> 00:44:05.420
and they turn out to have
the exact same mutation

00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:06.210
in the same gene.

00:44:06.210 --> 00:44:07.390
What's up with that?

00:44:07.390 --> 00:44:11.380
If you get that gene from this
parent, you get this disease.

00:44:11.380 --> 00:44:14.150
If you get it from that
parent, you get that disease.

00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:17.600
Totally boggling,
making no sense at all.

00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:19.610
First thing to
have to be solved.

00:44:19.610 --> 00:44:23.320
What's a mechanism for actually
making a gene work differently

00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:25.500
depending on which
parent it comes from?

00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:27.660
For those who care about
these sorts of details,

00:44:27.660 --> 00:44:30.570
it's a biochemical process
called methylation.

00:44:30.570 --> 00:44:33.890
You methylate the gene in
one parent's genome and not

00:44:33.890 --> 00:44:34.680
the other.

00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:35.930
Don't worry about the details.

00:44:35.930 --> 00:44:39.580
The main way is there is a
genetic mechanism for making

00:44:39.580 --> 00:44:44.410
genes work differently depending
on which parent it comes from.

00:44:44.410 --> 00:44:46.130
So OK, we know how to do it.

00:44:46.130 --> 00:44:47.440
Why should this happen?

00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:49.330
Why does this make any sense?

00:44:49.330 --> 00:44:53.640
And it took a while, and people
began to see patterns to this.

00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:55.970
And finally this
was put together

00:44:55.970 --> 00:44:58.040
by an evolutionary
biologist at Harvard

00:44:58.040 --> 00:45:00.510
named David Haig in
the early '90s, who

00:45:00.510 --> 00:45:04.680
came up with a unifying
theory which explains it all.

00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:06.550
And it's very cool.

00:45:06.550 --> 00:45:08.160
Here's what you see.

00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:11.310
You begin to look
at imprinted genes.

00:45:11.310 --> 00:45:14.250
And for our purposes, the
way we can describe them

00:45:14.250 --> 00:45:18.040
is, this is a gene where if
you get it from one parent,

00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:19.670
it does what it's
supposed to do.

00:45:19.670 --> 00:45:22.710
If you get it from another
parent, it's silenced.

00:45:22.710 --> 00:45:23.600
It never works.

00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:25.640
It's methylated into silence.

00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:27.190
These are imprinted genes.

00:45:27.190 --> 00:45:29.220
So he began to notice something.

00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:32.560
When you look at
imprinted genes where

00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:35.860
they are active if they
come from the father,

00:45:35.860 --> 00:45:41.150
they all tend to be genes
that promote fetal growth.

00:45:41.150 --> 00:45:44.790
They're all genes that
increase fetal metabolism.

00:45:44.790 --> 00:45:48.870
They're all genes that
make for a thicker uterus.

00:45:48.870 --> 00:45:51.360
They're all genes driven
by hormones coming out

00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:52.100
of the fetus.

00:45:52.100 --> 00:45:56.690
They're all genes that push
for greater fetal development.

00:45:56.690 --> 00:45:59.750
And then you look at the
imprinted genes coming

00:45:59.750 --> 00:46:02.310
from the female, and
they're all genes

00:46:02.310 --> 00:46:05.560
that tend to slow down
fetal development.

00:46:05.560 --> 00:46:07.170
What have we got here?

00:46:07.170 --> 00:46:10.330
We've got that intersexual
competition played out

00:46:10.330 --> 00:46:11.730
precisely there.

00:46:11.730 --> 00:46:14.430
You've got this
male hamster who's

00:46:14.430 --> 00:46:16.020
going to mate and
never be seen again

00:46:16.020 --> 00:46:17.384
because he's in this category.

00:46:17.384 --> 00:46:18.300
And what does he want?

00:46:18.300 --> 00:46:21.400
He could care less what happens
to the future reproductive

00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:22.740
success of this female.

00:46:22.740 --> 00:46:25.670
He wants this offspring
of his to survive.

00:46:25.670 --> 00:46:29.330
The male imprinted genes
push for greater amounts

00:46:29.330 --> 00:46:30.710
of fetal growth.

00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:32.540
And the female ones
saying, well, that'll

00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:34.310
be great if this kid
survives, but I also

00:46:34.310 --> 00:46:36.740
have a future reproductive
life to think about.

00:46:36.740 --> 00:46:39.250
Her imprinted genes
tend to counter it.

00:46:39.250 --> 00:46:41.310
What would this look like?

00:46:41.310 --> 00:46:43.870
One of the imprinted genes,
first ones identified,

00:46:43.870 --> 00:46:47.080
which comes [? from ?]
active from the male, codes

00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:52.350
for a protein called
insulin-like growth factor.

00:46:52.350 --> 00:46:54.810
Who cares what insulin-like
growth factor does?

00:46:54.810 --> 00:46:57.210
What's clear from the name
is it's a growth factor.

00:46:57.210 --> 00:47:00.480
It's one of those things
that make fetuses grow more.

00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:02.900
It promotes fetal growth.

00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:05.070
And then meanwhile,
the female hamster

00:47:05.070 --> 00:47:08.300
has a cognate, an
opposing imprinted gene.

00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:10.010
What's that one for?

00:47:10.010 --> 00:47:13.740
That codes the gene for the
insulin-like growth factor

00:47:13.740 --> 00:47:15.280
receptor.

00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:17.290
And what her
version does is make

00:47:17.290 --> 00:47:19.570
for a less responsive receptor.

00:47:19.570 --> 00:47:23.030
The male was pushing for more of
the insulin-like growth factor.

00:47:23.030 --> 00:47:26.030
She gets a receptor
that's not as responsive.

00:47:26.030 --> 00:47:29.510
And you literally have this
co-evolutionary arms race

00:47:29.510 --> 00:47:32.750
there of male imprinted
genes evolving to push

00:47:32.750 --> 00:47:34.320
for more and more fetal growth.

00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:37.940
Female ones pushing for
less and less fetal growth.

00:47:37.940 --> 00:47:40.730
And you see that coming
out most apparently

00:47:40.730 --> 00:47:43.990
when you see mutations
in some of these genes.

00:47:43.990 --> 00:47:47.030
For example, another pair
of imprinted genes, one

00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:48.620
from the father,
one from the mother,

00:47:48.620 --> 00:47:53.620
and what you see there
is the father's version

00:47:53.620 --> 00:47:58.330
promotes invasion, placental
invasion, into the uterus.

00:47:58.330 --> 00:47:59.800
And that's actually
the term that

00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:02.770
gynecologists use,
invasion of the fetus

00:48:02.770 --> 00:48:04.710
into the uterine wall.

00:48:04.710 --> 00:48:06.240
It promotes more of that.

00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:09.180
The female version
slows it down.

00:48:09.180 --> 00:48:11.310
So what if you have
a disease where

00:48:11.310 --> 00:48:14.660
the male gene relevant to this
is mutated and knocked out

00:48:14.660 --> 00:48:15.740
of action?

00:48:15.740 --> 00:48:18.590
You solely have
the female input,

00:48:18.590 --> 00:48:23.060
which is decreasing fetal
implantation into the uterus.

00:48:23.060 --> 00:48:24.270
What have you got then?

00:48:24.270 --> 00:48:29.030
You've got a disease where
fertilized eggs don't implant.

00:48:29.030 --> 00:48:30.840
On the other side,
suppose there's

00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:34.250
a mutation in the female
part of this pairing.

00:48:34.250 --> 00:48:37.160
And as a result, all you
have is the male input

00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:41.040
driving for more and more
aggressive fetal invasion.

00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:42.110
What do you have?

00:48:42.110 --> 00:48:45.400
You wind up with one of
the all time bad cancers

00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:47.890
you don't want to
get, choriocarcinoma,

00:48:47.890 --> 00:48:49.950
a cancer of the
uterus, because it's

00:48:49.950 --> 00:48:52.130
growing completely
out of control

00:48:52.130 --> 00:48:53.830
being prompted by the fetus.

00:48:53.830 --> 00:48:56.820
When you take out each of the
voices through a mutation,

00:48:56.820 --> 00:48:58.910
you see that normally
you're having

00:48:58.910 --> 00:49:03.360
this tilting, this balancing,
of competition between males

00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:06.070
pushing for more fetal
growth at the expense

00:49:06.070 --> 00:49:09.030
of the future reproductive
success of the female, females

00:49:09.030 --> 00:49:10.310
trying to slow it down.

00:49:10.310 --> 00:49:12.920
All of the imprinted
genes show this.

00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:17.140
Amazingly, people now have
even identified imprinted genes

00:49:17.140 --> 00:49:20.470
that don't work
until after birth,

00:49:20.470 --> 00:49:22.800
and they work in the brain.

00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:24.410
And what do they do?

00:49:24.410 --> 00:49:28.390
The male-derived one does
things like make for infants

00:49:28.390 --> 00:49:30.230
that suckle more.

00:49:30.230 --> 00:49:32.820
Ooh, get more
calories out of mom.

00:49:32.820 --> 00:49:34.750
And the female
version tends to blunt

00:49:34.750 --> 00:49:36.310
some of the suckling reflexes.

00:49:36.310 --> 00:49:39.950
It's all built around the
strategy of males and females

00:49:39.950 --> 00:49:43.180
do not necessarily have
exactly overlapping

00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:45.510
reproductive strategies.

00:49:45.510 --> 00:49:47.210
So another version
of it is one--

00:49:47.210 --> 00:49:50.550
a male gene which is
pushing towards expression

00:49:50.550 --> 00:49:54.610
of the fetal enzyme fetal
lactogen, placental lactogen.

00:49:54.610 --> 00:49:57.500
And what that does is it
makes it easier for the fetus

00:49:57.500 --> 00:50:00.510
to grab sugar out of the
bloodstream from the mother,

00:50:00.510 --> 00:50:02.430
and the mother
tries to counter it.

00:50:02.430 --> 00:50:04.680
And if she's not very
effective at doing it,

00:50:04.680 --> 00:50:06.450
or if she's rather
over-effective,

00:50:06.450 --> 00:50:11.010
you get pregnancy hypoglycemia,
pregnancy diabetes.

00:50:11.010 --> 00:50:15.190
Suddenly, this is mom having
a fight with her offspring

00:50:15.190 --> 00:50:17.610
over how much calories
they're going to get,

00:50:17.610 --> 00:50:21.990
the offspring being driven by an
imprinted gene from the father.

00:50:21.990 --> 00:50:24.320
Totally cool,
totally interesting.

00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:27.190
There should be a problem
lurking here, though,

00:50:27.190 --> 00:50:33.560
which is this is a pattern you
only see in tournament species.

00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:36.240
You got a pair-bonding
species, and there's

00:50:36.240 --> 00:50:39.300
no reason why a male should be
saying something like, ooh, I

00:50:39.300 --> 00:50:42.210
want to like ruin her
future reproductive success

00:50:42.210 --> 00:50:44.240
at the cost of her giving birth.

00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:47.045
I'm a pair-bonding
vole, and I want

00:50:47.045 --> 00:50:49.270
her to give birth to a child
the size of an elephant

00:50:49.270 --> 00:50:51.820
who's going to survive, and
who cares about her future?

00:50:51.820 --> 00:50:53.070
They're pair bonding.

00:50:53.070 --> 00:50:55.270
They're in it together
for the rest of time.

00:50:55.270 --> 00:50:59.480
You don't find imprinted
genes in pair-bonding species.

00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:02.650
You find imprinted genes
in tournament species.

00:51:02.650 --> 00:51:04.680
And thus, we get back
to that same issue

00:51:04.680 --> 00:51:07.740
the other day looking at
tournament versus pair.

00:51:07.740 --> 00:51:09.940
Where do humans fall into this?

00:51:09.940 --> 00:51:12.770
And what we've already seen
is, if humans can come up

00:51:12.770 --> 00:51:15.840
with choriocarcinomas
and things like that,

00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:17.820
we have imprinted genes.

00:51:17.820 --> 00:51:20.360
Same punchline again
as the other day--

00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:21.870
in terms of the
number of genes we

00:51:21.870 --> 00:51:25.370
have puts us somewhere
in between tournament

00:51:25.370 --> 00:51:27.120
and pair-bonding species.

00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:29.940
Again, we are terribly confused.

00:51:29.940 --> 00:51:30.440
OK.

00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:32.510
Let's take a five-minute
break, and we will pick up

00:51:32.510 --> 00:51:33.323
with more examples.

00:51:39.521 --> 00:51:40.020
OK.

00:51:43.510 --> 00:51:45.520
Let's get going again.

00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:46.900
Two good questions just now.

00:51:46.900 --> 00:51:50.740
One is, where does homosexuality
fit into all of this?

00:51:50.740 --> 00:51:52.940
And where it fits in
is about 30 minutes

00:51:52.940 --> 00:51:56.160
worth of the sexual behavior
lecture sometime in mid-May.

00:51:56.160 --> 00:51:59.120
It is a challenge for
some of this thinking.

00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:02.020
The second good question was,
am I capable of speaking louder?

00:52:02.020 --> 00:52:03.060
I will try.

00:52:03.060 --> 00:52:04.610
I mumble.

00:52:04.610 --> 00:52:05.210
OK.

00:52:05.210 --> 00:52:06.060
Pushing on.

00:52:06.060 --> 00:52:10.060
So we've just brought in this
whole bizarre, unexpected world

00:52:10.060 --> 00:52:14.570
of trashing the Hallmark cards
of intersexual competition.

00:52:14.570 --> 00:52:17.850
Another example of it, a
really interesting one.

00:52:17.850 --> 00:52:19.230
This was work done
by a guy named

00:52:19.230 --> 00:52:22.320
William Rice at Santa Cruz
over some years looking

00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:25.110
at a number of
different fly species.

00:52:25.110 --> 00:52:28.050
Female flies are polyandrous.

00:52:28.050 --> 00:52:30.040
They mate with a lot
of different males.

00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:31.080
And you're a male.

00:52:31.080 --> 00:52:32.480
You've just mated with a female.

00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:34.730
And what you would
like more than anything

00:52:34.730 --> 00:52:37.260
in order to pass on
copies of your own genes

00:52:37.260 --> 00:52:40.520
is, like, not have some
other guy impregnate

00:52:40.520 --> 00:52:44.170
her, some other male fly
guy who's intimidating you.

00:52:44.170 --> 00:52:45.620
Not have some other guy do it.

00:52:45.620 --> 00:52:48.730
And suddenly, what you see is
this interesting world where,

00:52:48.730 --> 00:52:51.260
because of the mating
frequency of the females,

00:52:51.260 --> 00:52:54.470
she will have sperm from a
number of different males

00:52:54.470 --> 00:52:56.950
inside her at the same time.

00:52:56.950 --> 00:53:01.170
And suddenly, we get this very
strange world, a whole field

00:53:01.170 --> 00:53:05.210
of research, of sperm
competition-- sperm

00:53:05.210 --> 00:53:07.950
competition of
[? regal A teams, ?]

00:53:07.950 --> 00:53:10.750
and gold medals and
all of that, of sperm

00:53:10.750 --> 00:53:13.580
competing with the
sperm from other males.

00:53:13.580 --> 00:53:18.090
And what you see is, in fly
species, the sperm of males

00:53:18.090 --> 00:53:22.670
make toxins that kill
the sperm of other males.

00:53:22.670 --> 00:53:23.810
Whoa.

00:53:23.810 --> 00:53:25.170
That's very elegant.

00:53:25.170 --> 00:53:27.000
That's very elegant
because it, in part,

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:29.170
requires you to come
up with a toxin that

00:53:29.170 --> 00:53:30.980
isn't toxic to yourself.

00:53:30.980 --> 00:53:31.910
You can solve that.

00:53:31.910 --> 00:53:34.090
All sorts of molecular
tricks for doing that.

00:53:34.090 --> 00:53:35.980
But this makes wonderful sense.

00:53:35.980 --> 00:53:38.720
You increase the likelihood
of you, the sperm,

00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:40.440
reaching the goal
line and killing

00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:41.820
the other guys and all of that.

00:53:41.820 --> 00:53:44.410
Except there is a
problem for the females,

00:53:44.410 --> 00:53:46.940
which is these toxins
that the male sperm

00:53:46.940 --> 00:53:50.860
release aren't such a hot
deal for the female's health.

00:53:50.860 --> 00:53:54.690
And what Rice did with these
really interesting studies--

00:53:54.690 --> 00:53:56.750
I won't go into the details
of it, in large part

00:53:56.750 --> 00:53:58.940
because I still don't
understand what the guy did.

00:53:58.940 --> 00:54:01.750
But he was able to
somehow take populations

00:54:01.750 --> 00:54:05.680
of male and female flies,
and he would hold the females

00:54:05.680 --> 00:54:08.710
so that they could not evolve
in response to whatever

00:54:08.710 --> 00:54:11.450
was going on with the
males-- male-male competition

00:54:11.450 --> 00:54:14.670
for reproduction-- while he
held constant the female-female

00:54:14.670 --> 00:54:15.490
competition.

00:54:15.490 --> 00:54:17.050
The females were not evolving.

00:54:17.050 --> 00:54:18.175
The males were.

00:54:18.175 --> 00:54:21.360
And what he saw over the
course of 30 generations

00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:23.760
was this male-male
sperm competition

00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:26.100
was such that the
male sperm were making

00:54:26.100 --> 00:54:29.490
such powerful toxins that
they were shortening the life

00:54:29.490 --> 00:54:31.930
expectancies of the females.

00:54:31.930 --> 00:54:32.630
Whoa.

00:54:32.630 --> 00:54:33.501
That's not smart.

00:54:33.501 --> 00:54:34.000
Whoa.

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:35.360
That makes perfect sense.

00:54:35.360 --> 00:54:38.120
House flies are not
your pair-bonding swans

00:54:38.120 --> 00:54:40.990
dying in each other's arms
for life sort of organisms.

00:54:40.990 --> 00:54:43.640
It's a classic case
of the male only has

00:54:43.640 --> 00:54:45.910
an investment in the
current reproductive bout.

00:54:45.910 --> 00:54:48.690
And if he can wipe out
the competitor's sperm

00:54:48.690 --> 00:54:50.500
and, oh, bummer,
the female has now

00:54:50.500 --> 00:54:53.910
got all sorts of rotty
necrotic lesions in her vagina,

00:54:53.910 --> 00:54:56.610
this is not a very
reproductively effective female

00:54:56.610 --> 00:54:57.710
fly down the line.

00:54:57.710 --> 00:54:58.650
What do I care?

00:54:58.650 --> 00:55:01.410
I'm off to the next pile
of cow dung after that.

00:55:01.410 --> 00:55:03.430
You have that same
structure there,

00:55:03.430 --> 00:55:05.900
but this is a bummer
for the females.

00:55:05.900 --> 00:55:08.420
The males, left to
their own competition,

00:55:08.420 --> 00:55:11.410
will evolve more and
more toxic sperm,

00:55:11.410 --> 00:55:13.480
which exacts more
and more of a price

00:55:13.480 --> 00:55:16.520
on the future reproductive
success of the females.

00:55:16.520 --> 00:55:18.760
Now Rice flips things.

00:55:18.760 --> 00:55:20.600
And now he takes
these populations,

00:55:20.600 --> 00:55:23.030
and he holds the male
evolution constant

00:55:23.030 --> 00:55:24.970
and allows the
females to evolve.

00:55:24.970 --> 00:55:27.930
And over the course
of 30 generations,

00:55:27.930 --> 00:55:32.190
they have evolved a means
of detoxifying the sperm.

00:55:32.190 --> 00:55:35.630
So here we have male-male
competition inadvertently being

00:55:35.630 --> 00:55:37.910
played out in an
intersexual realm

00:55:37.910 --> 00:55:41.950
as well, where, again, this
co-evolutionary arms race--

00:55:41.950 --> 00:55:43.020
totally bizarre.

00:55:43.020 --> 00:55:46.530
Sperm killing each other, and
sperm damaging the female.

00:55:46.530 --> 00:55:50.170
And that makes no sense if you
do for the good of the species.

00:55:50.170 --> 00:55:54.810
Again, very logical in the
context of these models, these

00:55:54.810 --> 00:55:56.310
models of evolution.

00:55:56.310 --> 00:55:58.160
OK, final example.

00:55:58.160 --> 00:56:01.870
And here's one that will become
very relevant way down the line

00:56:01.870 --> 00:56:04.640
when we're are looking at things
like the biology of aggression.

00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:06.700
So you've got these
social primates.

00:56:06.700 --> 00:56:08.480
And in lots of social
mammals, you've

00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:11.940
got this pattern, which is one
of the genders picks up around

00:56:11.940 --> 00:56:14.980
puberty and moves
to another group.

00:56:14.980 --> 00:56:18.400
It's to avoid inbreeding and
everybody having six fingers

00:56:18.400 --> 00:56:20.810
and tails, if you're a species
that doesn't have a tail,

00:56:20.810 --> 00:56:22.240
and is perfectly logical.

00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:24.970
And what you need is just
some sort of [? pattern-- ?]

00:56:24.970 --> 00:56:29.780
is that the females or the males
of the species which disperse?

00:56:29.780 --> 00:56:31.850
And no one among the
primates has ever

00:56:31.850 --> 00:56:34.960
found a good rule for
which primate species have

00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:40.310
female exogamy or male exogamy,
which gender leaves at puberty.

00:56:40.310 --> 00:56:42.540
But there's
variability in chimps.

00:56:42.540 --> 00:56:44.770
It's the females who
leave at puberty.

00:56:44.770 --> 00:56:47.300
In gorillas, it's the
females who leave at puberty.

00:56:47.300 --> 00:56:50.990
In baboons, macaques, a few
other Old World monkeys,

00:56:50.990 --> 00:56:54.330
it's the males who leave at
puberty, with a very critical

00:56:54.330 --> 00:56:55.820
implication.

00:56:55.820 --> 00:56:57.580
So you've got baboons.

00:56:57.580 --> 00:57:00.950
Baboons-- you've got the troop,
and you look at the adult males

00:57:00.950 --> 00:57:02.740
and adult females in there.

00:57:02.740 --> 00:57:05.920
The adult females
grew up in that group.

00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:08.560
The adult males grew
up someplace else

00:57:08.560 --> 00:57:11.290
and emigrated into
here at puberty.

00:57:11.290 --> 00:57:14.950
In other words, among the
adult females in this group,

00:57:14.950 --> 00:57:16.540
they're all relatives.

00:57:16.540 --> 00:57:19.530
Among the males,
there's no relatives.

00:57:19.530 --> 00:57:21.760
Meanwhile, next door
with the chimps,

00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:23.940
it's the females who
have left at puberty.

00:57:23.940 --> 00:57:26.060
You look at the mature
animals in the group,

00:57:26.060 --> 00:57:28.490
and it's the males who were
there with all the relatives

00:57:28.490 --> 00:57:30.010
who have been there
all their life,

00:57:30.010 --> 00:57:32.730
and the females who
have no relatives.

00:57:32.730 --> 00:57:34.780
So asking a question.

00:57:34.780 --> 00:57:38.610
Comparing baboons and chimps,
which of those species

00:57:38.610 --> 00:57:43.850
has higher levels of male-male
aggression within the group?

00:57:43.850 --> 00:57:44.850
[INAUDIBLE]

00:57:44.850 --> 00:57:48.490
Baboons, yeah, because
they're all brothers

00:57:48.490 --> 00:57:51.070
and brothers-at-arms in
the chimp group there.

00:57:51.070 --> 00:57:53.040
And none of the adult
males in baboon troops

00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:54.730
are typically related
to each other.

00:57:54.730 --> 00:57:59.270
Very high levels of intramale
aggression intragroup.

00:57:59.270 --> 00:58:01.790
So which species,
on a certain level,

00:58:01.790 --> 00:58:03.500
has put us to
shame when it comes

00:58:03.500 --> 00:58:07.630
to the invention of warfare,
of fighting between groups?

00:58:07.630 --> 00:58:10.150
Chimps, because
you've got bunches

00:58:10.150 --> 00:58:13.660
of males who cooperate
because they are relatives.

00:58:13.660 --> 00:58:15.390
And what you wind up
seeing with chimps--

00:58:15.390 --> 00:58:17.030
and we will eventually
get to this--

00:58:17.030 --> 00:58:20.650
is you see things that are now
termed "border patrols," where

00:58:20.650 --> 00:58:23.290
a bunch of males from
a group will patrol

00:58:23.290 --> 00:58:24.910
the edge of their territory.

00:58:24.910 --> 00:58:27.680
If they encounter a male
from the group over there,

00:58:27.680 --> 00:58:28.680
they will attack.

00:58:28.680 --> 00:58:31.840
They will kill him, as
documented by Jane Goodall.

00:58:31.840 --> 00:58:34.520
Taken to an extreme,
the males of one group

00:58:34.520 --> 00:58:37.370
will eradicate another group.

00:58:37.370 --> 00:58:40.370
And if the rule is, I
am killing this guy,

00:58:40.370 --> 00:58:42.332
we are killing this
guy, not because we

00:58:42.332 --> 00:58:44.290
don't like the look on
his face, but because he

00:58:44.290 --> 00:58:47.630
is a member of that group,
this is the United Nations

00:58:47.630 --> 00:58:49.440
definition of genocide.

00:58:49.440 --> 00:58:52.380
Chimps have not only come
up with organized warfare

00:58:52.380 --> 00:58:54.220
between groups,
they have come up

00:58:54.220 --> 00:58:55.980
with a chimp
version of genocide.

00:58:55.980 --> 00:58:57.870
What's the driving
force on that?

00:58:57.870 --> 00:59:02.210
One of the truly scary
things on this planet, which

00:59:02.210 --> 00:59:04.290
is when all the males
living next door

00:59:04.290 --> 00:59:06.240
are getting along
with each other.

00:59:06.240 --> 00:59:07.940
Because when they
do, they suddenly

00:59:07.940 --> 00:59:09.750
start looking over at this side.

00:59:09.750 --> 00:59:13.780
Organized males driven by
female exogamy in chimps

00:59:13.780 --> 00:59:16.300
is where the warfare
pattern comes from.

00:59:16.300 --> 00:59:18.590
And as you can
guess, when we get

00:59:18.590 --> 00:59:21.160
to thinking about the biology
of aggression with humans,

00:59:21.160 --> 00:59:24.450
we are suddenly in this
world of taking non-relatives

00:59:24.450 --> 00:59:26.810
who were military
recruits and convincing

00:59:26.810 --> 00:59:28.990
them to pseudo-kinship
themselves

00:59:28.990 --> 00:59:33.971
into being a band of brothers,
increasing the sense of kinship

00:59:33.971 --> 00:59:34.470
there.

00:59:34.470 --> 00:59:35.990
Chimps do this all on their own.

00:59:35.990 --> 00:59:39.330
So now making sense of
which primate species have

00:59:39.330 --> 00:59:41.030
high levels of
male-male aggression

00:59:41.030 --> 00:59:44.490
within group versus between
group, between group

00:59:44.490 --> 00:59:47.790
are ones where it's the
females who leave at puberty.

00:59:47.790 --> 00:59:49.490
All these guys
have been together

00:59:49.490 --> 00:59:52.320
since they were terrorizing
other kids in kindergarten.

00:59:52.320 --> 00:59:54.910
They're an organized
group against each other.

00:59:54.910 --> 00:59:58.390
You get intergroup organized
conflict in primates

00:59:58.390 --> 01:00:02.220
that have female exogamy,
females leaving at puberty.

01:00:02.220 --> 01:00:02.869
OK.

01:00:02.869 --> 01:00:05.160
So we've now worked our way
through a bunch of examples

01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:08.280
here and how to apply
individual selection,

01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:10.690
kin selection,
that sort of thing.

01:00:10.690 --> 01:00:13.960
A fourth branch has come into
the field in the last decade

01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:14.870
or so.

01:00:14.870 --> 01:00:18.370
And this is one that has had
a lot of controversy, in part

01:00:18.370 --> 01:00:21.470
because what it is built around
is mistaken by a lot of folks

01:00:21.470 --> 01:00:23.010
as being an outdated concept.

01:00:23.010 --> 01:00:25.530
But in part because what
it is actually implying

01:00:25.530 --> 01:00:27.680
is very controversial
in some realms.

01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:30.660
And this is this business
of group selection

01:00:30.660 --> 01:00:33.220
somehow sneaking
back in the back door

01:00:33.220 --> 01:00:36.189
there and becoming
relevant to the evolution

01:00:36.189 --> 01:00:36.980
of social behavior.

01:00:36.980 --> 01:00:37.810
Group selection.

01:00:37.810 --> 01:00:39.020
You remember Wednesday.

01:00:39.020 --> 01:00:42.530
All the wildebeests there,
and the elderly wildebeest

01:00:42.530 --> 01:00:45.970
pushes his way forward and
distributes his bank account

01:00:45.970 --> 01:00:48.840
and then leaps into the river
and the crocs and all of that.

01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:51.420
And that makes no sense at all
because animals don't behave

01:00:51.420 --> 01:00:52.586
for the good of the species.

01:00:52.586 --> 01:00:54.400
In individual selection,
he got pushed in.

01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:57.070
Nonetheless, a notion
of group selection

01:00:57.070 --> 01:01:00.860
has come back into thinking, but
it occurs only under a couple

01:01:00.860 --> 01:01:02.690
of specialized circumstances.

01:01:02.690 --> 01:01:06.040
The version that we just
trashed, which was the version

01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:07.040
Marlin-- OK.

01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:10.510
How many of you guys know
who Marlin Perkins was?

01:01:10.510 --> 01:01:11.840
It's come to that.

01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:12.740
Marlin Perkins.

01:01:12.740 --> 01:01:15.420
How many of you guys know
what-- does Mutual of Omaha,

01:01:15.420 --> 01:01:16.430
does that still exist?

01:01:16.430 --> 01:01:19.110
Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom?

01:01:19.110 --> 01:01:21.470
Is that still a
television program?

01:01:21.470 --> 01:01:21.970
Yes, no?

01:01:21.970 --> 01:01:24.403
When you were young
did that exist?

01:01:24.403 --> 01:01:24.902
Yeah.

01:01:24.902 --> 01:01:25.401
OK.

01:01:25.401 --> 01:01:28.140
Is it still sponsored
by Mutual of Omaha?

01:01:28.140 --> 01:01:29.330
They still do.

01:01:29.330 --> 01:01:31.560
That's great, OK,
because that one has been

01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:33.400
going for decades and decades.

01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:39.460
And they'd somehow always have
to segue to Mutual of Omaha

01:01:39.460 --> 01:01:41.780
in there doing the
commercials, building it

01:01:41.780 --> 01:01:45.980
like, just as rhinos will
mate on for hours on end,

01:01:45.980 --> 01:01:49.350
you want fire insurance for
your home or some such thing.

01:01:49.350 --> 01:01:51.540
But in its original
couple of decades,

01:01:51.540 --> 01:01:54.050
it was hosted by a guy
named Marlin Perkins,

01:01:54.050 --> 01:01:56.800
and Marlin Perkins
taught most of America

01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:58.680
their evolutionary biology.

01:01:58.680 --> 01:02:01.270
Marlin Perkins is the
guy who taught everybody

01:02:01.270 --> 01:02:04.090
behaving for the good of the
species and that sort of thing.

01:02:04.090 --> 01:02:06.350
The first version of
group selection that got

01:02:06.350 --> 01:02:10.100
trashed in the '60s was Marlin
Perkins' group selection.

01:02:10.100 --> 01:02:13.190
The group selection that's
sneaking back into the field

01:02:13.190 --> 01:02:16.650
is very different, two
different versions.

01:02:16.650 --> 01:02:23.550
First one, something you will
get in various populations.

01:02:23.550 --> 01:02:26.040
You've got a population
of something or others,

01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:29.670
and some biogeographic
event occurs,

01:02:29.670 --> 01:02:32.680
which causes a subset
of them to get isolated

01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:33.710
from everybody else.

01:02:33.710 --> 01:02:38.390
A land bridge disappears,
or somebody drops a lake

01:02:38.390 --> 01:02:39.640
there, or who knows what.

01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:43.530
But something isolates a small
subset of the population.

01:02:43.530 --> 01:02:46.990
So these guys go about
reproducing by their standards,

01:02:46.990 --> 01:02:49.970
and these guys go about
reproducing by their standards.

01:02:49.970 --> 01:02:52.160
And what's going to be
a characteristic very

01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:54.790
soon of the smaller
population, they're

01:02:54.790 --> 01:02:58.830
going to be more inbred
than this population

01:02:58.830 --> 01:03:00.540
simply because they're smaller.

01:03:00.540 --> 01:03:03.500
They're going to have a
higher degree of relatedness

01:03:03.500 --> 01:03:05.810
among individuals.

01:03:05.810 --> 01:03:09.710
So now we throw our second piece
of our three building blocks,

01:03:09.710 --> 01:03:11.420
throw in kin selection.

01:03:11.420 --> 01:03:13.020
And what that
immediately predicts

01:03:13.020 --> 01:03:16.970
is levels of cooperation
will be higher in this group

01:03:16.970 --> 01:03:21.520
than in this group, because the
higher degree of relatedness.

01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:22.770
That's great.

01:03:22.770 --> 01:03:25.300
And that's great
because once we see

01:03:25.300 --> 01:03:28.990
how these sort of cooperative
systems have a larger payoff,

01:03:28.990 --> 01:03:31.710
you will get a crystallization
so that everybody,

01:03:31.710 --> 01:03:33.980
the second or third
cousins, are eventually

01:03:33.980 --> 01:03:36.650
going to have to be just as
cooperative as the siblings are

01:03:36.650 --> 01:03:37.660
with each other.

01:03:37.660 --> 01:03:41.370
You are going to fix
a trait of cooperation

01:03:41.370 --> 01:03:43.750
in that population
at a high rate.

01:03:43.750 --> 01:03:46.860
So notice here, in this
case, we have a high degree

01:03:46.860 --> 01:03:50.310
of cooperation driven
by kin selection,

01:03:50.310 --> 01:03:52.880
whereas these guys are going
about their usual "savage

01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:55.110
at each other's
throats" business.

01:03:55.110 --> 01:03:58.250
Biogeographic event
reverses, and these guys

01:03:58.250 --> 01:04:01.580
get reincorporated into
the main population.

01:04:01.580 --> 01:04:04.410
And they're so different
by then that they

01:04:04.410 --> 01:04:05.830
get a different color.

01:04:05.830 --> 01:04:09.950
And what you've got then is,
here in the large population,

01:04:09.950 --> 01:04:13.980
here is a nucleus of
animals who are cooperating,

01:04:13.980 --> 01:04:18.520
and here is the huge, unwashed
mass of the ones who are not.

01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:21.300
And everything we know
about reciprocal altruism,

01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:23.530
all of that, means
that these guys

01:04:23.530 --> 01:04:26.520
are going to start
out-competing these guys.

01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:29.710
And the model that is
used is cooperation

01:04:29.710 --> 01:04:32.100
will have to
crystallize outward.

01:04:32.100 --> 01:04:35.820
Animals will have to join in
in these cooperative patterns

01:04:35.820 --> 01:04:38.920
because these guys
will outcompete them.

01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:40.010
What do we have?

01:04:40.010 --> 01:04:42.150
This is called a founder effect.

01:04:42.150 --> 01:04:45.870
This is a small population
that, thanks to being inbred,

01:04:45.870 --> 01:04:48.920
has fixated some trait
that's advantageous.

01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:51.350
[? Where ?] the evolution
here moves faster than

01:04:51.350 --> 01:04:54.560
in here because of the smaller
population with the inbreeding,

01:04:54.560 --> 01:04:56.990
some adaptive trait
comes in there.

01:04:56.990 --> 01:04:59.450
They get re-induced into
the main population,

01:04:59.450 --> 01:05:02.280
and this founder-driven
trait quickly

01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:04.910
spreads throughout
the population.

01:05:04.910 --> 01:05:08.070
And what you get here is, if
the same thing is occurring

01:05:08.070 --> 01:05:11.160
in the realm of behavior,
reciprocal, cooperative

01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:14.240
behavior, somewhere in
here you have a transition

01:05:14.240 --> 01:05:17.450
from this being a kin
selection phenomenon

01:05:17.450 --> 01:05:20.900
to this being a reciprocal
altruism phenomenon.

01:05:20.900 --> 01:05:24.240
So that stands as one of
the models out there for,

01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:26.720
how do you jump
start cooperation

01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:29.120
in non-relative populations?

01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:32.710
You use inbred founder
populations to drive it there.

01:05:32.710 --> 01:05:35.560
And just to have a metaphor,
all you need to do,

01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:39.930
think about in some city
there's some occupations,

01:05:39.930 --> 01:05:42.380
some mercantile something
or other, that there's

01:05:42.380 --> 01:05:45.000
a gazillion of them, and all
sorts of people work in that.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:46.880
And there's a subgroup
of people there

01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:49.540
who work in this
who are all related.

01:05:49.540 --> 01:05:52.170
And as a result, they
do something cooperative

01:05:52.170 --> 01:05:53.360
and kin selective.

01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:56.590
They make low-interest
loans to each other.

01:05:56.590 --> 01:06:00.020
And as a result, they're
more successful at business,

01:06:00.020 --> 01:06:02.050
and they get
incorporated into here.

01:06:02.050 --> 01:06:04.540
And what you then have
is this economic force

01:06:04.540 --> 01:06:06.900
that everybody
else has to join in

01:06:06.900 --> 01:06:10.320
to this cooperative business
of trusting each other,

01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:14.480
or low-interest loans, or
I trust you like a sibling.

01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:16.450
You don't have to pay
me in full next week.

01:06:16.450 --> 01:06:18.210
Used to be that only
siblings trusted

01:06:18.210 --> 01:06:19.470
each other like siblings.

01:06:19.470 --> 01:06:21.850
But a force there
for more cooperation,

01:06:21.850 --> 01:06:25.949
a driving force of inbred
kin selection initially.

01:06:25.949 --> 01:06:27.490
So that's one way
in which people are

01:06:27.490 --> 01:06:29.700
thinking about group selection.

01:06:29.700 --> 01:06:33.030
And here you now have
this group out-competing

01:06:33.030 --> 01:06:34.490
this because of this trait.

01:06:34.490 --> 01:06:37.370
And people actually use
terms like "crystallization."

01:06:37.370 --> 01:06:41.460
The trait of cooperation will
crystallize outward and fix

01:06:41.460 --> 01:06:43.210
in the whole population.

01:06:43.210 --> 01:06:45.000
So that's one version of it.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.440
And this is one, again,
we will come back to,

01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:50.780
this is one of the ways
to jumpstart cooperation

01:06:50.780 --> 01:06:54.077
in a world in which there
is no reciprocal altruism.

01:06:54.077 --> 01:06:55.660
Because you see the
problem with that.

01:06:55.660 --> 01:06:58.470
We all have learned
tit for tat is the best

01:06:58.470 --> 01:07:00.690
one, except
[? forgiving ?] tit for tat

01:07:00.690 --> 01:07:02.910
might be better, except
Pavlov might even be better.

01:07:02.910 --> 01:07:05.910
And all of those who built
around this one requirement,

01:07:05.910 --> 01:07:09.140
though, which is somebody
has to make the first move

01:07:09.140 --> 01:07:10.590
of being cooperative.

01:07:10.590 --> 01:07:12.700
That's got to
jumpstart the system.

01:07:12.700 --> 01:07:15.060
And what we all
know is, in a system

01:07:15.060 --> 01:07:17.470
that doesn't go along with
the rules of can't we all

01:07:17.470 --> 01:07:20.210
sing "Kumbaya," what
happens is the first one

01:07:20.210 --> 01:07:22.510
in the first round who does
something cooperative is

01:07:22.510 --> 01:07:24.890
some schmuck who's one
step behind everybody

01:07:24.890 --> 01:07:26.360
else for the rest of time.

01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:30.320
There's no way to get these
cooperative systems to evolve

01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:31.220
initially.

01:07:31.220 --> 01:07:32.760
We'll see there are ways.

01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:35.400
And this is one of those--
have it driven initially

01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:39.510
by kin selection, and then throw
it into the general population.

01:07:39.510 --> 01:07:42.440
So that's one version of where
group selection has crept back

01:07:42.440 --> 01:07:43.290
in.

01:07:43.290 --> 01:07:46.820
Another version is sort of the
more generalized form of it.

01:07:46.820 --> 01:07:49.380
And it could be illustrated--
OK, the following example.

01:07:49.380 --> 01:07:51.250
You've got chickens.

01:07:51.250 --> 01:07:54.260
You've got chickens
with an array of traits,

01:07:54.260 --> 01:07:56.800
and you can see there's
two types of chickens.

01:07:56.800 --> 01:08:01.570
One chicken is super aggressive
and beats on everybody else,

01:08:01.570 --> 01:08:04.060
and she lays lots of eggs.

01:08:04.060 --> 01:08:07.310
Another chicken-- far more
pacific and introspective

01:08:07.310 --> 01:08:10.930
and less aggressive
and has fewer eggs.

01:08:10.930 --> 01:08:14.500
So now you take any one of
the high-aggression females

01:08:14.500 --> 01:08:17.100
and one of the low-aggression
guys and put them together,

01:08:17.100 --> 01:08:19.750
and who's going to leave
more copies of her genes?

01:08:19.750 --> 01:08:22.819
The high-aggression female
laying lots of eggs.

01:08:22.819 --> 01:08:25.540
Now instead, you
have a whole group

01:08:25.540 --> 01:08:28.390
of the high-aggression
females and a whole group

01:08:28.390 --> 01:08:29.859
of the low-aggression females.

01:08:29.859 --> 01:08:32.370
What's going to happen in
the high-aggression females?

01:08:32.370 --> 01:08:35.350
They're all so aggressive that
they all injure each other.

01:08:35.350 --> 01:08:38.000
They all stress each other
into lower fertility rates,

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:38.660
all of that.

01:08:38.660 --> 01:08:42.010
And suddenly you have
this very important world

01:08:42.010 --> 01:08:48.760
in which A can dominate
B, but where groups of B

01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:52.520
dominate groups of A.
And it's in that realm

01:08:52.520 --> 01:08:55.790
that you suddenly get a push
towards group selection.

01:08:55.790 --> 01:09:00.189
When selection on that level--
a world of any individual being

01:09:00.189 --> 01:09:02.830
outcompeted because of a trait.

01:09:02.830 --> 01:09:07.100
But as a "collective"-- and
bringing in that word not

01:09:07.100 --> 01:09:10.090
randomly, as a collective
in the collectivist future

01:09:10.090 --> 01:09:13.380
of low-ranking chickens to
throw off their chains--

01:09:13.380 --> 01:09:16.350
once you have a group of them,
the same traits that could be

01:09:16.350 --> 01:09:20.170
disadvantageous on an
individual dyadic level,

01:09:20.170 --> 01:09:22.479
as a group outcompetes
the others.

01:09:22.479 --> 01:09:26.200
And when you do that, you've
suddenly got group selection

01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:29.880
in a classical form,
where these animals,

01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:32.080
because of their traits,
they are not behaving

01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:33.430
for the good of the group.

01:09:33.430 --> 01:09:35.760
But the very traits
that are disadvantageous

01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:38.847
individually are
advantageous as a group.

01:09:38.847 --> 01:09:40.680
And it's another way
of thinking about this.

01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:43.990
If you indiscriminately
make low-interest loans

01:09:43.990 --> 01:09:46.479
to everybody on earth,
you are very readily

01:09:46.479 --> 01:09:48.229
falling into this category.

01:09:48.229 --> 01:09:50.450
If you were part of
a group that makes

01:09:50.450 --> 01:09:52.540
low-interest loans
to each other,

01:09:52.540 --> 01:09:55.010
suddenly you
outcompete the other.

01:09:55.010 --> 01:09:56.255
A fascinating book.

01:09:56.255 --> 01:09:59.750
An evolutionary biologist
named David Sloan Wilson, who's

01:09:59.750 --> 01:10:02.510
been the main person pushing
for this idea for decades,

01:10:02.510 --> 01:10:05.740
has a very broad range of
intellectual interests,

01:10:05.740 --> 01:10:07.220
including religious history.

01:10:07.220 --> 01:10:09.430
And a number of years
ago, he published a book

01:10:09.430 --> 01:10:11.730
called Darwin's Cathedral.

01:10:11.730 --> 01:10:15.680
And he analyzed the birth
of clusters of new religions

01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:21.340
over time as examples of
founder effects and group

01:10:21.340 --> 01:10:23.040
selection-type properties.

01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:25.340
And he wound up,
in great detail,

01:10:25.340 --> 01:10:31.150
analyzing Calvin and the
starts of Calvinism and Calvin

01:10:31.150 --> 01:10:34.960
and his sidekick Hobbes in
Zurich in the 17th century,

01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:37.010
or whenever it was
that Calvinism started,

01:10:37.010 --> 01:10:39.850
of analyzing how there were all
sorts of these little religions

01:10:39.850 --> 01:10:42.570
popping up there in
these little city-states.

01:10:42.570 --> 01:10:45.350
And what it was about
Calvinism-- in I

01:10:45.350 --> 01:10:47.440
think it was Zurich--
that took off,

01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:51.390
where they established some
of these inbred cooperative

01:10:51.390 --> 01:10:53.620
patterns and then
beat the pants off

01:10:53.620 --> 01:10:55.150
of all the other city-states.

01:10:55.150 --> 01:10:57.880
And soon, all of central
Europe was Calvinist.

01:10:57.880 --> 01:11:00.440
Really interesting
book in that regard.

01:11:00.440 --> 01:11:01.020
OK.

01:11:01.020 --> 01:11:05.140
So back has come this whole
possibility of group selection.

01:11:05.140 --> 01:11:07.610
And out of that has come the
more broad way of thinking

01:11:07.610 --> 01:11:11.440
about it now, which is
multi-level selection,

01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:15.720
a very important concept here,
which is sometimes selection

01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:18.912
occurs entirely on the
level of a single gene.

01:11:18.912 --> 01:11:22.840
In other words, have a gene
with bad enough of a mutation,

01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:25.250
and it doesn't matter how
many great other genes you got

01:11:25.250 --> 01:11:26.220
going for you.

01:11:26.220 --> 01:11:28.360
Selection will be
decided entirely

01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:30.930
on the basis of one gene.

01:11:30.930 --> 01:11:34.120
As we saw in our principles
from the other day, much more

01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:37.930
common-- selection at the
level of the individual,

01:11:37.930 --> 01:11:41.130
[? at ?] an aggregation of
the genotype playing out

01:11:41.130 --> 01:11:43.730
in terms of phenotype all
the different traits there.

01:11:43.730 --> 01:11:47.450
But what this introduces is some
circumstances where selection

01:11:47.450 --> 01:11:49.680
is at the group level.

01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:53.620
And it is never at the level of
how an individual's trait plays

01:11:53.620 --> 01:11:55.640
out individually in a group.

01:11:55.640 --> 01:11:58.280
It's how this trait
played out individually

01:11:58.280 --> 01:12:02.350
emerges as a group behavior
that you get group selection.

01:12:02.350 --> 01:12:05.020
And this marks this
great peace that's

01:12:05.020 --> 01:12:07.250
come between this
David Sloan Wilson

01:12:07.250 --> 01:12:09.670
and the guy who's probably
the most towering figure

01:12:09.670 --> 01:12:12.170
in this whole field,
this guy EO Wilson,

01:12:12.170 --> 01:12:15.210
Edward O. Wilson at Harvard.

01:12:15.210 --> 01:12:17.380
David Sloan Wilson and
EO Wilson spent years

01:12:17.380 --> 01:12:20.350
not getting along with each
other because Wilson-- Wilson--

01:12:20.350 --> 01:12:23.090
because EO Wilson
is very strongly

01:12:23.090 --> 01:12:25.270
individual
selectionist model guy,

01:12:25.270 --> 01:12:27.410
and thus he hated
group selection.

01:12:27.410 --> 01:12:29.300
David Sloan Wilson,
the other way around.

01:12:29.300 --> 01:12:31.140
Each of them were
endlessly invited

01:12:31.140 --> 01:12:34.910
to the wrong parties because
of the same shared last name

01:12:34.910 --> 01:12:36.850
and all sorts of social
awkwardness there.

01:12:36.850 --> 01:12:39.436
In the last few years, I
don't know what happened.

01:12:39.436 --> 01:12:41.060
I don't know if they
arranged marriages

01:12:41.060 --> 01:12:43.080
between their
grandchildren or something.

01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:45.210
But they arranged
some sort of truce.

01:12:45.210 --> 01:12:48.110
And Wilson-Wilson
published a paper last year

01:12:48.110 --> 01:12:50.561
basically saying,
whoa, you know what?

01:12:50.561 --> 01:12:53.060
Some of the time I'm right, and
some of the time he's right.

01:12:53.060 --> 01:12:55.101
And isn't that great, and
can't we all get along,

01:12:55.101 --> 01:12:59.070
and delineating circumstances
where individual selection--

01:12:59.070 --> 01:13:01.840
individual selection, kin
selection, reciprocal altruism

01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:03.760
is going to dominate
circumstances

01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:06.600
where selection is going to get
played out at the group level.

01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:07.840
They love each other now.

01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:09.300
They have formed a new language.

01:13:09.300 --> 01:13:11.020
They share burial customs.

01:13:11.020 --> 01:13:14.300
And this sort of constitutes
a great resolution.

01:13:14.300 --> 01:13:16.180
Yeah, depending on
the circumstances,

01:13:16.180 --> 01:13:18.190
the most important
thing in evolution

01:13:18.190 --> 01:13:22.940
might be a single gene, a single
organism, or a single group.

01:13:22.940 --> 01:13:26.730
And the power of a group
and aggregate traits that

01:13:26.730 --> 01:13:29.080
work lousy in the
individual is going

01:13:29.080 --> 01:13:31.080
to be really important
down the line

01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:34.410
when thinking about aggression
and stopping aggression

01:13:34.410 --> 01:13:35.840
and things of that sort.

01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:37.010
OK.

01:13:37.010 --> 01:13:38.250
So all of this is great.

01:13:38.250 --> 01:13:41.150
This multi-level
selection now showing

01:13:41.150 --> 01:13:43.330
sort of a fancier,
more sophisticated way

01:13:43.330 --> 01:13:46.220
of thinking about
individual, kin,

01:13:46.220 --> 01:13:48.490
reciprocal circumstances,
where it works,

01:13:48.490 --> 01:13:51.200
circumstances where this is
the most interesting thing.

01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:52.380
So that's great.

01:13:52.380 --> 01:13:55.420
So now we begin to look
for a first pass of where

01:13:55.420 --> 01:13:56.850
humans fit into this.

01:13:56.850 --> 01:14:00.520
We've already seen in terms of
all of these traits, tournament

01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:03.530
versus pair bonding, we're
somewhere in between.

01:14:03.530 --> 01:14:06.940
In terms of imprinted genes,
we're somewhere in between.

01:14:06.940 --> 01:14:08.140
These are specifics.

01:14:08.140 --> 01:14:10.830
How do we begin for
a first pass to think

01:14:10.830 --> 01:14:14.510
about humans, human behavior,
fitting into these frameworks?

01:14:14.510 --> 01:14:17.960
Two problems, or two
issues, that are all we'll

01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:19.060
touch on at this point.

01:14:19.060 --> 01:14:22.150
The first one is, there
is this temptation,

01:14:22.150 --> 01:14:26.070
as soon as you think along
these lines, to discover, oh,

01:14:26.070 --> 01:14:27.130
isn't that interesting?

01:14:27.130 --> 01:14:30.100
Langur monkeys will
have infanticide.

01:14:30.100 --> 01:14:32.720
Male langur monkeys will kill
the kids of some other male.

01:14:32.720 --> 01:14:35.030
Human males do that sometimes.

01:14:35.030 --> 01:14:39.130
Oh, langur monkeys might be an
interesting evolutionary model

01:14:39.130 --> 01:14:42.370
for where infanticidal
behavior came from in humans.

01:14:42.370 --> 01:14:44.580
Oh, isn't this interesting?

01:14:44.580 --> 01:14:46.929
Dominance is passed
along by males.

01:14:46.929 --> 01:14:48.970
We do that [? sometimes. ?]
isn't it interesting?

01:14:48.970 --> 01:14:50.310
Kidnapping somehow occurs.

01:14:50.310 --> 01:14:52.900
And before you know it, you
have a world in which people

01:14:52.900 --> 01:14:56.720
are saying, well, damselflies do
something that look like rape.

01:14:56.720 --> 01:15:00.290
So huh, we've got a damselfly
model of human behavior

01:15:00.290 --> 01:15:01.150
in that realm.

01:15:01.150 --> 01:15:02.790
And two things are
happening there.

01:15:02.790 --> 01:15:06.140
One is taking the traits,
a small number of traits,

01:15:06.140 --> 01:15:09.280
in some other species and
inflating the relevance it has

01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:10.510
for understanding us.

01:15:10.510 --> 01:15:12.310
The other danger
is that somewhere,

01:15:12.310 --> 01:15:14.650
creeping below the
surface, is you see

01:15:14.650 --> 01:15:16.780
it happens in other species.

01:15:16.780 --> 01:15:18.580
It's kind of natural.

01:15:18.580 --> 01:15:20.020
It's kind of inevitable.

01:15:20.020 --> 01:15:22.730
This is a whole world in
which people have run off

01:15:22.730 --> 01:15:26.710
with how this applies to humans
in a completely distorted way.

01:15:26.710 --> 01:15:30.600
We are unique as a species,
as is every other species.

01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:31.570
We are unique.

01:15:31.570 --> 01:15:33.640
By applying the same
evolutionary rules

01:15:33.640 --> 01:15:36.830
that every other species has,
that's the commonality, not

01:15:36.830 --> 01:15:38.040
the outcome.

01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:39.930
The other challenge
is constantly

01:15:39.930 --> 01:15:43.040
going to be that you get all
these great predictive models,

01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:45.580
and then humans
go and screw it up

01:15:45.580 --> 01:15:48.540
by having quirks
and idiosyncrasies

01:15:48.540 --> 01:15:50.990
and personalities
and stuff like that.

01:15:50.990 --> 01:15:53.620
All I can say in that realm
is, back to Wednesday,

01:15:53.620 --> 01:15:55.900
if making sense of
which lions are going

01:15:55.900 --> 01:15:59.720
to go to the scary speaker
in the bushes there revolves,

01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:02.440
in some part, around
personalities, humans,

01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:05.890
by the time you get to us,
blindly assuming these models

01:16:05.890 --> 01:16:11.160
apply is going to be very shaky.

01:16:11.160 --> 01:16:11.690
OK.

01:16:11.690 --> 01:16:13.530
So just a first
pass at how one will

01:16:13.530 --> 01:16:15.420
have to be cautious
for the rest of course

01:16:15.420 --> 01:16:16.820
in applying all these models.

01:16:16.820 --> 01:16:20.230
Now, far more critically,
is looking at,

01:16:20.230 --> 01:16:22.650
what are the criticisms
that have been brought

01:16:22.650 --> 01:16:24.470
against this whole framework?

01:16:24.470 --> 01:16:27.010
This framework of
social behavior

01:16:27.010 --> 01:16:29.235
has evolved to maximize
the number of copies

01:16:29.235 --> 01:16:32.440
of genes driven by kin,
driven by reciprocal altruism.

01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:34.680
Group selection is a rare
trait, but when it does,

01:16:34.680 --> 01:16:35.850
it follows these properties.

01:16:35.850 --> 01:16:38.510
This is how you explain
all the behavior.

01:16:38.510 --> 01:16:41.020
Know these four or
five rules and not only

01:16:41.020 --> 01:16:43.500
can you look at two
skulls of different sizes,

01:16:43.500 --> 01:16:47.140
but you can explain all behavior
and all of human behavior,

01:16:47.140 --> 01:16:48.360
and it's all biology.

01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:50.920
And eventually,
as EO Wilson said

01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:53.500
in his landmark
book of his in 1975,

01:16:53.500 --> 01:16:57.200
Social Biology, eventually
all of the social sciences

01:16:57.200 --> 01:17:00.630
will be under the wing
of evolutionary biology.

01:17:00.630 --> 01:17:02.500
No surprise that social
scientists were not

01:17:02.500 --> 01:17:04.960
very pleased with that
proclamation at that point.

01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:06.840
But this was this
notion that this was

01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:08.920
going to explain everything.

01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:11.710
So what are the criticisms
that have been leveled

01:17:11.710 --> 01:17:12.960
at this style of thinking?

01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:15.760
And as we'll see, there
are a lot of them.

01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:17.880
All of the stuff we've
been thinking about,

01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:22.560
this basic notion of applying
the Darwinian rules as to why

01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:25.460
giraffe have to have hearts
of certain size to behavior,

01:17:25.460 --> 01:17:28.960
there's three features that
are coming through [INAUDIBLE].

01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:34.280
The first one is the notion
of heritability of traits.

01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:35.960
Because what we've
been discussing

01:17:35.960 --> 01:17:38.720
throughout the last
lecture or so is,

01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:42.430
there's heritability of the
tendency to kidnap infants

01:17:42.430 --> 01:17:44.070
at the right strategic time.

01:17:44.070 --> 01:17:46.900
There's heritability
of the tendency

01:17:46.900 --> 01:17:49.980
to decide that you like
males with big, fancy plumage

01:17:49.980 --> 01:17:51.610
and long canines.

01:17:51.610 --> 01:17:55.120
There's heritability to deciding
that your daughter should

01:17:55.120 --> 01:17:58.260
be highest ranking in
the troop [INAUDIBLE].

01:17:58.260 --> 01:17:59.250
Heritability.

01:17:59.250 --> 01:18:02.880
An assumption of heritable
behavioral traits

01:18:02.880 --> 01:18:06.170
runs through every single
one of these discussions.

01:18:06.170 --> 01:18:08.320
The next theme that runs
throughout all of them

01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:10.930
is the notion of adaptiveness.

01:18:10.930 --> 01:18:15.300
If some trait has emerged
out of the evolutionary murk,

01:18:15.300 --> 01:18:18.270
if some trait has
been selected for,

01:18:18.270 --> 01:18:21.800
selection implies
adaptiveness-- the notion

01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:25.290
that everything you see has an
adaptive explanation for why

01:18:25.290 --> 01:18:27.590
it's emerged evolutionarily.

01:18:27.590 --> 01:18:31.110
The third principle, which
is not explicitly stated

01:18:31.110 --> 01:18:33.900
in this field very often but
is implicit to everything

01:18:33.900 --> 01:18:37.780
about it, is these processes
of evolutionary change

01:18:37.780 --> 01:18:39.030
are gradual.

01:18:39.030 --> 01:18:42.240
At every generation, if by
getting into some better

01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:45.240
behavioral strategy for
playing prisoner's dilemma

01:18:45.240 --> 01:18:48.850
you leave 1% more copies of
your genes than everybody else,

01:18:48.850 --> 01:18:51.010
come back in 100
zillion generations

01:18:51.010 --> 01:18:52.870
and that trait will have spread.

01:18:52.870 --> 01:18:56.280
All of this is played out in
generation after generation

01:18:56.280 --> 01:18:58.720
so that evolutionary
change is occurring

01:18:58.720 --> 01:19:02.300
in gradual, incremental steps.

01:19:02.300 --> 01:19:05.200
So what do you do with
these three starting points?

01:19:05.200 --> 01:19:06.220
The first one.

01:19:06.220 --> 01:19:08.390
An awful lot of
the next two weeks

01:19:08.390 --> 01:19:10.620
will be looking at how
other disciplines look

01:19:10.620 --> 01:19:12.690
at the issue of, how
do you figure out

01:19:12.690 --> 01:19:14.825
when a behavior is genetic?

01:19:14.825 --> 01:19:16.450
And one of the first
things we'll learn

01:19:16.450 --> 01:19:19.210
is how that phrase means
absolutely nothing whatsoever.

01:19:19.210 --> 01:19:21.580
Maybe a better way of
stating it is, how do you

01:19:21.580 --> 01:19:25.789
figure out when a behavioral
trait has a genetic influence?

01:19:25.789 --> 01:19:27.830
And as we'll see, even
the safer way of saying it

01:19:27.830 --> 01:19:29.830
is, how do you
figure out in which

01:19:29.830 --> 01:19:32.120
environment a
certain behavior has

01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:33.710
a particular genetic influence?

01:19:33.710 --> 01:19:37.420
How do other disciplines go
about saying, oh, it's genetic.

01:19:37.420 --> 01:19:38.420
It's genetic.

01:19:38.420 --> 01:19:41.530
In this field, among this sort
of sociobiological thinking,

01:19:41.530 --> 01:19:44.570
what you do is an
inverse style of proof.

01:19:44.570 --> 01:19:47.780
You say, OK, if a trait
has a genetic component,

01:19:47.780 --> 01:19:50.410
you would expect it to be
heritable along these lines.

01:19:50.410 --> 01:19:52.226
If it's more adaptive,
it will increase

01:19:52.226 --> 01:19:53.350
its frequency, all of that.

01:19:53.350 --> 01:19:57.150
And look, that explains where
competitive infanticide has

01:19:57.150 --> 01:19:57.830
come from.

01:19:57.830 --> 01:20:00.820
Show me a more
explanatory model.

01:20:00.820 --> 01:20:03.270
Show me a model that
is more predictive.

01:20:03.270 --> 01:20:05.180
And until you can
show me one, I'm

01:20:05.180 --> 01:20:07.300
assuming this trait
has some heritability.

01:20:07.300 --> 01:20:10.310
And we'll see how, by next
week, the more molecular people

01:20:10.310 --> 01:20:12.200
rip this view to shreds.

01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:14.970
Tell me, when you're
talking about heritability

01:20:14.970 --> 01:20:17.570
of some behavior,
show me the damn gene.

01:20:17.570 --> 01:20:19.690
Show me the sequence of DNA.

01:20:19.690 --> 01:20:22.080
Show me how that
produces the behavior.

01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:24.620
This is where this field
ends saying, oh, we

01:20:24.620 --> 01:20:28.480
can inferentially sort of decide
there's a genetic influence.

01:20:28.480 --> 01:20:31.270
As we'll see by next
week, this one piece

01:20:31.270 --> 01:20:34.770
is the main thing attacked
by a number of other fields.

01:20:34.770 --> 01:20:37.710
Next piece, the
adaptiveness-- the notion

01:20:37.710 --> 01:20:39.960
that everything
that has evolved has

01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:43.280
evolved under the scalpel
of evolutionary demand

01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:45.290
for optimization
and all of that.

01:20:45.290 --> 01:20:46.960
And the critics
of this view call

01:20:46.960 --> 01:20:50.580
this the adaptationist
fallacy-- the notion

01:20:50.580 --> 01:20:53.510
that everything is
there for a good reason.

01:20:53.510 --> 01:20:57.040
And what they often do in terms
of making fun of that is that,

01:20:57.040 --> 01:20:58.670
oh, you look at people
who do this kind

01:20:58.670 --> 01:21:01.650
of evolutionary biology with
this adaptationist emphasis,

01:21:01.650 --> 01:21:04.040
and it's one big just-so story.

01:21:04.040 --> 01:21:06.970
Why do giraffe have
hearts with thick muscles?

01:21:06.970 --> 01:21:09.980
And here's the story I make up,
and if my story is better than

01:21:09.980 --> 01:21:11.560
yours, I get tenure
and you don't.

01:21:11.560 --> 01:21:13.700
Why is that the
zebras got stripes?

01:21:13.700 --> 01:21:15.600
Why is it that
males kill infants

01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:17.040
in this species or whatever?

01:21:17.040 --> 01:21:18.710
That everything is adaptive.

01:21:18.710 --> 01:21:21.080
And what you need to do now
is come up with the story

01:21:21.080 --> 01:21:22.580
to explain why it's adaptive.

01:21:22.580 --> 01:21:25.040
And if it fits some of those
principles of individual

01:21:25.040 --> 01:21:27.190
and group, et
cetera, then you win.

01:21:27.190 --> 01:21:29.380
You've got the
best just-so story.

01:21:29.380 --> 01:21:33.050
And what is constantly
brought as a sort of criticism

01:21:33.050 --> 01:21:37.650
of that is, show me experimental
evidence that it is adaptive.

01:21:37.650 --> 01:21:39.110
And by the time
we get to looking

01:21:39.110 --> 01:21:41.400
at the field of ethology,
you'll see a whole way

01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:42.850
in which people do that.

01:21:42.850 --> 01:21:46.280
Show me that it's
possible to disprove it.

01:21:46.280 --> 01:21:50.340
OK, tell me a just-so story,
where if that were the case,

01:21:50.340 --> 01:21:52.810
that would prove that this
is not what's going on.

01:21:52.810 --> 01:21:54.460
You got to have the
rules of science.

01:21:54.460 --> 01:21:56.980
It can't just be you observe
something and come up

01:21:56.980 --> 01:21:58.790
with the best story and you win.

01:21:58.790 --> 01:22:01.920
But what's most striking in sort
of terms of criticizing this

01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:04.090
is some domains
in which there are

01:22:04.090 --> 01:22:07.900
traits that have not evolved
because they are adaptive.

01:22:07.900 --> 01:22:11.630
They've just evolved because
they are excess baggage.

01:22:11.630 --> 01:22:15.440
And this has brought in a whole
sort of criticism of the field.

01:22:15.440 --> 01:22:17.600
Now, some of the time, when
you begin to see-- it's

01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:20.530
kind of hard to see where
the adaptiveness is.

01:22:20.530 --> 01:22:23.370
It's because it's a more
subtle feature of it.

01:22:23.370 --> 01:22:26.060
For example, you
could look at squid.

01:22:26.060 --> 01:22:28.430
And someone who is
enamored with fish

01:22:28.430 --> 01:22:31.910
and how cool and aerodynamic,
aquadynamic, fish are

01:22:31.910 --> 01:22:33.660
and all of that, will
point out that squid

01:22:33.660 --> 01:22:36.860
are pretty lousy swimmers
compared to all sorts of fish.

01:22:36.860 --> 01:22:39.690
They're pretty lousy
swimmers compared to fish,

01:22:39.690 --> 01:22:41.750
but they're pretty great
swimmers for something

01:22:41.750 --> 01:22:45.250
starting out evolutionarily
as a mollusk.

01:22:45.250 --> 01:22:47.990
This adaptiveness has to be
in the context of where it

01:22:47.990 --> 01:22:49.880
came from and where it got to.

01:22:49.880 --> 01:22:51.740
OK, so that is a qualifier.

01:22:51.740 --> 01:22:54.250
Nonetheless, even
factoring that in,

01:22:54.250 --> 01:22:57.870
of hidden features of adaptation
in evolutionary history,

01:22:57.870 --> 01:23:00.690
there's lots of traits that
are simply not adaptive.

01:23:00.690 --> 01:23:02.850
And one of the most
effective critics

01:23:02.850 --> 01:23:05.260
of this whole view,
Stephen Jay Gould,

01:23:05.260 --> 01:23:09.300
introduced a term about 30 years
ago that summarized this view.

01:23:09.300 --> 01:23:12.540
Gould was a
paleontologist at Harvard,

01:23:12.540 --> 01:23:15.650
and his thinking will come
in a whole lot in next week's

01:23:15.650 --> 01:23:16.230
lectures.

01:23:16.230 --> 01:23:19.290
He teamed up with another guy, a
molecular geneticist at Harvard

01:23:19.290 --> 01:23:20.560
named Richard Lewontin.

01:23:20.560 --> 01:23:24.100
And in critiquing a lot of
this, they came up with a term

01:23:24.100 --> 01:23:27.090
saying an awful lot
of traits have evolved

01:23:27.090 --> 01:23:29.410
that exist not because
they're adaptive,

01:23:29.410 --> 01:23:32.690
but because they're spandrels.

01:23:32.690 --> 01:23:34.490
So at that point,
everybody in the field

01:23:34.490 --> 01:23:36.040
had to go run to
their dictionary

01:23:36.040 --> 01:23:39.010
because Gould and Lewontin were
all being snotty and coming up

01:23:39.010 --> 01:23:41.430
with fancy, highfalutin
culture terms,

01:23:41.430 --> 01:23:44.730
because it turns out "spandrel"
is a term from architecture.

01:23:44.730 --> 01:23:47.340
So immediately, they already
won points off of everyone else

01:23:47.340 --> 01:23:48.880
for being all
cultured and stuff.

01:23:48.880 --> 01:23:55.740
But a spandrel, a spandrel is
you got some medieval building.

01:23:55.740 --> 01:24:01.950
Remarkably enough, that's a
medieval building, and-- [SIGH]

01:24:01.950 --> 01:24:05.310
[LAUGHTER]

01:24:05.310 --> 01:24:06.765
--it's a nice medieval building.

01:24:06.765 --> 01:24:07.265
[LAUGHTER]

01:24:07.265 --> 01:24:11.960
And what you get is you have
these arches that-- there winds

01:24:11.960 --> 01:24:14.170
up being a space
between arches, that's

01:24:14.170 --> 01:24:16.419
there's space between
arches just because you

01:24:16.419 --> 01:24:17.960
can't build arches
next to each other

01:24:17.960 --> 01:24:19.820
without there being
like this space here.

01:24:19.820 --> 01:24:24.570
This is solid brick or
LEGO blocks or whatever.

01:24:24.570 --> 01:24:27.510
So you have these arches, and
there's a space in between.

01:24:27.510 --> 01:24:28.750
And you got this space.

01:24:28.750 --> 01:24:30.480
It's not there for
any good reason.

01:24:30.480 --> 01:24:33.600
It's there because you can't put
two arches next to each other

01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:36.070
without coming up with
this triangular space.

01:24:36.070 --> 01:24:38.510
And the architectural
term for those triangles

01:24:38.510 --> 01:24:40.650
are "spandrels."

01:24:40.650 --> 01:24:44.060
And spandrels, in
architecture, is something

01:24:44.060 --> 01:24:45.840
that forms between two arches.

01:24:45.840 --> 01:24:47.960
And as Gould and
Lewontin used the term,

01:24:47.960 --> 01:24:52.320
a spandrel is some
trait that occurs simply

01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:55.130
as the unavoidable outcome
of some other traits that

01:24:55.130 --> 01:24:56.490
are being selected for.

01:24:56.490 --> 01:24:58.550
You can't put two
arches together

01:24:58.550 --> 01:25:02.310
without getting some sort of
triangular shape in between.

01:25:02.310 --> 01:25:06.250
And throughout the history of
architects making spandrels,

01:25:06.250 --> 01:25:10.710
these would be artistically
built up and all of that,

01:25:10.710 --> 01:25:13.490
and there would be all sorts
of decorative stuff on that.

01:25:13.490 --> 01:25:16.980
So if you were an adaptationist
[? folly ?] person,

01:25:16.980 --> 01:25:19.670
everything has an adaptive
[? purpose. ?] You look at that

01:25:19.670 --> 01:25:23.270
and, oh, there's got to be
some reason why spandrels have

01:25:23.270 --> 01:25:26.520
evolved and have these elaborate
secondary sexual features

01:25:26.520 --> 01:25:31.010
on spandrels, little gossamer
things flying around and stuff.

01:25:31.010 --> 01:25:33.230
And there's got to be
an adapt-- oh, I know,

01:25:33.230 --> 01:25:36.030
because people in church will
look up at it a whole lot,

01:25:36.030 --> 01:25:37.310
and their necks will get sore.

01:25:37.310 --> 01:25:38.851
And when their necks
stop being sore,

01:25:38.851 --> 01:25:40.650
they will decide this
is the glory of God,

01:25:40.650 --> 01:25:42.730
and they will increase
their [? belief. ?]

01:25:42.730 --> 01:25:44.890
That's why architects
put in spandrels.

01:25:44.890 --> 01:25:47.180
No, you can't build
buildings like this

01:25:47.180 --> 01:25:48.936
without spandrels happening.

01:25:48.936 --> 01:25:50.310
And just because
they were there,

01:25:50.310 --> 01:25:52.190
why not let's decorate them.

01:25:52.190 --> 01:25:54.560
That's the evolution
of spandrels.

01:25:54.560 --> 01:25:56.680
And in Gould and
Lewontin's critique,

01:25:56.680 --> 01:26:00.060
an awful lot of stuff,
where the sociobiology types

01:26:00.060 --> 01:26:02.660
would sit there and say, we're
going to have a just-so story

01:26:02.660 --> 01:26:04.650
contest now and
use our principles

01:26:04.650 --> 01:26:07.515
and figure out some way in
which this is actually adaptive,

01:26:07.515 --> 01:26:09.390
they're saying, this
actually wasn't selected

01:26:09.390 --> 01:26:10.710
for because it's adaptive.

01:26:10.710 --> 01:26:14.510
It was an inadvertent
byproduct of something else.

01:26:14.510 --> 01:26:16.830
So here's an example
of that would be given.

01:26:16.830 --> 01:26:19.930
Humans have chins.

01:26:19.930 --> 01:26:21.000
Humans have chins.

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:22.700
Apparently, all
humans do have chins

01:26:22.700 --> 01:26:24.140
hidden away someplace or other.

01:26:24.140 --> 01:26:25.190
Humans have chins.

01:26:25.190 --> 01:26:28.440
And weirdly, we're like
the only primate that does.

01:26:28.440 --> 01:26:30.540
You look at, like,
other apes and stuff,

01:26:30.540 --> 01:26:32.240
and they have the
sort of weak chins

01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:36.660
that suggest sort of immoral
characters and criminality

01:26:36.660 --> 01:26:37.540
and things like that.

01:26:37.540 --> 01:26:40.010
We're the only species
that has chins.

01:26:40.010 --> 01:26:43.780
And apparently, there's been
some like nutty adaptationist

01:26:43.780 --> 01:26:45.780
school somewhere
back when, trying

01:26:45.780 --> 01:26:49.070
to make sense of why it is
that humans evolved chins.

01:26:49.070 --> 01:26:51.810
Why it is that human faces
come to a point there,

01:26:51.810 --> 01:26:53.590
and what's the
adaptive advantage?

01:26:53.590 --> 01:26:56.626
And [? where ?] you
can, like, stab rivals--

01:26:56.626 --> 01:26:57.300
[LAUGHTER]

01:26:57.300 --> 01:27:01.370
--or you can get crumbs from
out of the corner on the floor

01:27:01.370 --> 01:27:02.600
and stuff with your chin.

01:27:02.600 --> 01:27:04.400
Until somebody figured
out that there's

01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:06.470
no way that you could
have a primate face

01:27:06.470 --> 01:27:09.664
that has a muzzle foreshortened
and a jaw at this angle.

01:27:09.664 --> 01:27:11.330
You do this, and you
do this, and you're

01:27:11.330 --> 01:27:14.481
going to get this little
spandrel thing sticking out

01:27:14.481 --> 01:27:14.980
there.

01:27:14.980 --> 01:27:18.110
And oh, there hasn't
been selection for a chin

01:27:18.110 --> 01:27:20.970
because you have selection
for a hominid face

01:27:20.970 --> 01:27:23.890
with a shortened muzzle, and
this thing pops out there.

01:27:23.890 --> 01:27:26.260
And suddenly, all
those doctoral theses

01:27:26.260 --> 01:27:28.630
about the reproductive
advantages of chins

01:27:28.630 --> 01:27:29.990
go down the tubes there.

01:27:29.990 --> 01:27:32.250
It was merely a spandrel.

01:27:32.250 --> 01:27:33.910
And Gould and
Lewontin's argument

01:27:33.910 --> 01:27:36.750
is that there's lots
and lots of spandrels,

01:27:36.750 --> 01:27:39.050
that this emphasis--
everything is adaptive,

01:27:39.050 --> 01:27:41.030
everything is the
outcome of competition--

01:27:41.030 --> 01:27:43.480
that's produced that,
an awful lot of stuff

01:27:43.480 --> 01:27:46.790
is excess baggage that
merely gets carried along

01:27:46.790 --> 01:27:50.520
because the evolutionary process
isn't all that efficient.

01:27:50.520 --> 01:27:52.320
You're starting with
a mollusk if you

01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:54.260
want to make yourself a squid.

01:27:54.260 --> 01:27:57.420
Giving rise to another concept,
another term in the field.

01:27:57.420 --> 01:28:02.390
Andre Lwoff, who was a
French-- or was it Jacob?

01:28:02.390 --> 01:28:05.860
They were these two French
molecular biology guys,

01:28:05.860 --> 01:28:07.640
and they both got Nobel Prizes.

01:28:07.640 --> 01:28:09.890
And one of them said this,
and I don't remember which,

01:28:09.890 --> 01:28:11.770
but I'm going to
say it was Lwoff

01:28:11.770 --> 01:28:13.320
because I like saying Lwoff.

01:28:13.320 --> 01:28:17.290
Andre Lwoff once said that
"Evolution is not an inventor.

01:28:17.290 --> 01:28:19.150
Evolution is a tinkerer."

01:28:19.150 --> 01:28:21.380
It works with
preexisting structures.

01:28:21.380 --> 01:28:23.820
And the notion that you're
going to see this everywhere,

01:28:23.820 --> 01:28:25.630
you're gluing stuff together.

01:28:25.630 --> 01:28:27.960
You're duct taping
this part of the pelvis

01:28:27.960 --> 01:28:30.710
to this part of the
circulatory system, whatever.

01:28:30.710 --> 01:28:32.280
And you're going
to have spandrels.

01:28:32.280 --> 01:28:35.000
An awful lot of
what those folks go

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.910
through in these whole song
and dances of adaptation

01:28:37.910 --> 01:28:39.990
are merely spandrels.

01:28:39.990 --> 01:28:44.240
Evolution is not about
optimizing every single trait.

01:28:44.240 --> 01:28:47.840
What comes out of
that is this notion

01:28:47.840 --> 01:28:51.730
that an awful lot of
this world of competition

01:28:51.730 --> 01:28:53.120
really isn't about competition.

01:28:53.120 --> 01:28:54.830
You stick with these
models, the models

01:28:54.830 --> 01:28:56.740
we've been covering
for the last two days,

01:28:56.740 --> 01:28:59.502
and every bit of
advantage is going

01:28:59.502 --> 01:29:01.460
to increase the number
of copies of your genes.

01:29:01.460 --> 01:29:03.200
What's the only
possible outcome?

01:29:03.200 --> 01:29:04.220
You need to compete.

01:29:04.220 --> 01:29:05.440
You need to outcompete.

01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:07.820
It was a critique
of this whole view

01:29:07.820 --> 01:29:11.410
as being one driven very
strongly by competition,

01:29:11.410 --> 01:29:13.680
because all the traits
there are driven

01:29:13.680 --> 01:29:16.550
by having to out-reproduce
the next individual, next

01:29:16.550 --> 01:29:17.460
individual.

01:29:17.460 --> 01:29:20.390
Another realm in which
this has been critiqued

01:29:20.390 --> 01:29:23.850
has been by, interestingly,
evolutionary biologists

01:29:23.850 --> 01:29:25.830
from the Soviet Union.

01:29:25.830 --> 01:29:28.080
And where it was
emphasized there--

01:29:28.080 --> 01:29:31.010
in Western sort of emphasis
in evolutionary biology,

01:29:31.010 --> 01:29:33.330
most of evolutionary
selection was

01:29:33.330 --> 01:29:35.850
about competing with
other individuals.

01:29:35.850 --> 01:29:38.320
Sexual competition,
competing for running

01:29:38.320 --> 01:29:41.000
away from the predator faster
than the guy next to you,

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:42.849
competing for food, all of that.

01:29:42.849 --> 01:29:44.640
If you're sitting there
in the Soviet Union

01:29:44.640 --> 01:29:47.270
and you're thinking about
evolutionary biology, what

01:29:47.270 --> 01:29:49.270
you're mostly thinking
about is evolving

01:29:49.270 --> 01:29:53.540
the means of surviving climate
demands, surviving extremes

01:29:53.540 --> 01:29:57.030
of climate, what would
be categorized as abiotic

01:29:57.030 --> 01:30:00.830
rather than biotic, abiotic
demands in the environment.

01:30:00.830 --> 01:30:03.430
And when you look at species
where most of their survival

01:30:03.430 --> 01:30:06.410
is about surviving
ecological extremes,

01:30:06.410 --> 01:30:08.110
environmental
extremes, you don't

01:30:08.110 --> 01:30:09.690
see a whole lot of competition.

01:30:09.690 --> 01:30:11.410
That's a world with far less.

01:30:11.410 --> 01:30:15.160
And throughout the years, the
Soviet evolutionary biologists

01:30:15.160 --> 01:30:18.730
tended to emphasize
abiotic selection, which

01:30:18.730 --> 01:30:21.870
had far less of an
emphasis on competition.

01:30:21.870 --> 01:30:24.540
The final piece,
though, the gradualism.

01:30:24.540 --> 01:30:28.240
The gradualism is very
intrinsic to this.

01:30:28.240 --> 01:30:30.260
Because if everything
is adaptive,

01:30:30.260 --> 01:30:32.080
every little bit of
advantage is worth

01:30:32.080 --> 01:30:34.520
fighting for, and
competition and killing

01:30:34.520 --> 01:30:36.880
each other's infants and
killing each other's sperms

01:30:36.880 --> 01:30:38.279
and oviducts and all of that.

01:30:38.279 --> 01:30:39.820
And every little
bit is going to make

01:30:39.820 --> 01:30:41.490
for a little bit
of an advantage,

01:30:41.490 --> 01:30:45.010
and you will have this
gradualist change.

01:30:45.010 --> 01:30:47.450
And the huge challenge
that came to that

01:30:47.450 --> 01:30:51.020
was from Gould and another
scientist in the '80s, a notion

01:30:51.020 --> 01:30:53.600
that maybe that's not
what evolution looks like.

01:30:53.600 --> 01:30:56.960
Maybe evolution is not
occurring in these gradualist,

01:30:56.960 --> 01:30:58.360
incremental steps.

01:30:58.360 --> 01:31:01.780
Maybe what occurs instead
is long periods of nothing

01:31:01.780 --> 01:31:04.122
happening and then a
rapid evolutionary change.

01:31:04.122 --> 01:31:05.580
In long periods,
nothing happening,

01:31:05.580 --> 01:31:08.030
then rapid evolutionary
change, something

01:31:08.030 --> 01:31:11.110
that they called
punctuated equilibrium.

01:31:11.110 --> 01:31:14.480
And the whole next lecture
is going to be about this.

01:31:14.480 --> 01:31:17.450
Critical implications--
the genetics

01:31:17.450 --> 01:31:19.950
of how stuff evolves
turns out to fit

01:31:19.950 --> 01:31:22.780
far better the molecular
genetics with these models

01:31:22.780 --> 01:31:26.890
of punctuated, rapid
change, and stasis,

01:31:26.890 --> 01:31:30.220
equilibrium, punctuated change,
rather than these gradualist

01:31:30.220 --> 01:31:30.940
models.

01:31:30.940 --> 01:31:34.190
And if that's what it looks
like in these steps, most

01:31:34.190 --> 01:31:35.980
of the time you're
not punching it

01:31:35.980 --> 01:31:39.280
out for every one-half of
1% reproductive advantage,

01:31:39.280 --> 01:31:40.890
and it's all competition.

01:31:40.890 --> 01:31:43.240
Most of the time,
nothing's happening at all,

01:31:43.240 --> 01:31:47.270
and there's periods of severe
selection and then long periods

01:31:47.270 --> 01:31:48.600
in which nothing happens.

01:31:48.600 --> 01:31:52.150
A step function like that,
the role of competition

01:31:52.150 --> 01:31:55.050
is reduced tremendously in
thinking about evolution.

01:31:55.050 --> 01:31:56.820
So we're going to
spend a ton of time

01:31:56.820 --> 01:31:59.760
looking at the punctuated
equilibrium model.

01:31:59.760 --> 01:32:01.450
To give away the
punch line that I

01:32:01.450 --> 01:32:03.880
know you are all on the
edge of your seats for,

01:32:03.880 --> 01:32:06.970
I kind of think it's right
in a lot of the circumstances

01:32:06.970 --> 01:32:09.130
of evolution because
it fits much better

01:32:09.130 --> 01:32:10.940
with the molecular biology.

01:32:10.940 --> 01:32:15.920
Finally, in addition to these
critiques of show me the genes,

01:32:15.920 --> 01:32:18.110
everything doesn't
have to be adaptive

01:32:18.110 --> 01:32:20.490
because there are spandrels,
and besides, this is really

01:32:20.490 --> 01:32:23.050
wimpy science where science
counts as making of the best

01:32:23.050 --> 01:32:26.770
story, and there's no reason
to think that it's gradual,

01:32:26.770 --> 01:32:28.430
there's a mechanism
for this as well.

01:32:28.430 --> 01:32:30.070
In addition to
that, there's always

01:32:30.070 --> 01:32:33.800
been a final realm of criticism
of this style of thinking,

01:32:33.800 --> 01:32:36.310
which has been a
political critique.

01:32:36.310 --> 01:32:37.930
And in lots of
realms of science,

01:32:37.930 --> 01:32:40.630
you can't really imagine
a political critique

01:32:40.630 --> 01:32:45.310
as to whether cilia on amoeba
flip this way or that way

01:32:45.310 --> 01:32:48.220
or a critique as to
whether, like, plants

01:32:48.220 --> 01:32:52.320
should have three clover
things or four clover things,

01:32:52.320 --> 01:32:54.520
that there's not a
political factor in that.

01:32:54.520 --> 01:32:57.900
There's a huge amount of
sociopolitical implications

01:32:57.900 --> 01:33:00.060
that run through
this entire field.

01:33:00.060 --> 01:33:03.820
Because it addresses
issues of like how natural,

01:33:03.820 --> 01:33:08.400
how evolutionarily ancient,
how evolutionarily honed, how

01:33:08.400 --> 01:33:12.050
adaptive are things like
whether a species, a society,

01:33:12.050 --> 01:33:17.420
has male domination or not,
has strict hierarchies or not,

01:33:17.420 --> 01:33:19.270
has certain degrees
of aggression,

01:33:19.270 --> 01:33:21.780
has certain patterns
of sexual coercion.

01:33:21.780 --> 01:33:24.670
And a whole world arguing
that these things have

01:33:24.670 --> 01:33:28.870
a naturalistic grounding in
adaptation versus a whole world

01:33:28.870 --> 01:33:30.340
that says that's jibberish.

01:33:30.340 --> 01:33:32.140
Most of the time,
nothing's happening.

01:33:32.140 --> 01:33:34.270
And when it does, a
lot of it is spandrels.

01:33:34.270 --> 01:33:37.170
Those have very different
political implications.

01:33:37.170 --> 01:33:40.930
And from day one, the
critics of this entire world

01:33:40.930 --> 01:33:42.880
have made a point of
something that initially

01:33:42.880 --> 01:33:45.560
seems kind of silly,
but may not be silly,

01:33:45.560 --> 01:33:48.260
which is the entire
founding generation

01:33:48.260 --> 01:33:53.550
of these sociobiologists
were white, Southern males.

01:33:53.550 --> 01:33:54.830
Make of that what you will.

01:33:54.830 --> 01:33:58.830
EO Wilson from Alabama,
Robert Trivers, Irven DeVore,

01:33:58.830 --> 01:34:00.330
a whole population
of these folks,

01:34:00.330 --> 01:34:02.340
the first generation
of these people,

01:34:02.340 --> 01:34:06.160
were all white males
from the American South.

01:34:06.160 --> 01:34:08.650
Whereas Gould and Lewontin,
all of these guys,

01:34:08.650 --> 01:34:11.210
were Northeastern Marxists.

01:34:11.210 --> 01:34:11.920
OK.

01:34:11.920 --> 01:34:15.290
So we got kind of a
major contrast here.

01:34:15.290 --> 01:34:18.490
And the critique of the
sociobiological view is, well,

01:34:18.490 --> 01:34:23.780
isn't it interesting that their
notion of how evolution works

01:34:23.780 --> 01:34:27.730
just happens to emphasize the
naturalness of a system that

01:34:27.730 --> 01:34:30.200
rewards them for the
inequalities that we have?

01:34:30.200 --> 01:34:33.400
Isn't it interesting that their
models predict the naturalness

01:34:33.400 --> 01:34:35.840
of a world in which they're
the ones who benefit most

01:34:35.840 --> 01:34:37.580
from the notion that
this is natural?

01:34:37.580 --> 01:34:40.540
And from day one, that has
been a strong critique.

01:34:40.540 --> 01:34:44.440
And that's not like critiquing
cilia amoeba theories

01:34:44.440 --> 01:34:46.120
for political implications.

01:34:46.120 --> 01:34:47.720
That is a very real one.

01:34:47.720 --> 01:34:51.390
Because the notions that this
is pertinent to making sense of,

01:34:51.390 --> 01:34:54.830
is rape a human
psychopathology, or is

01:34:54.830 --> 01:34:57.590
rape a competitive
strategy, is the fact

01:34:57.590 --> 01:35:00.430
that children are more likely
to be killed by stepfathers

01:35:00.430 --> 01:35:02.230
than by biological fathers.

01:35:02.230 --> 01:35:05.270
Does that represent something
about the typical socioeconomic

01:35:05.270 --> 01:35:07.740
pressures in families
with step-parents

01:35:07.740 --> 01:35:11.250
versus the natural biology
of gene competition

01:35:11.250 --> 01:35:12.930
through competitive infanticide?

01:35:12.930 --> 01:35:14.920
This has a lot of implications.

01:35:14.920 --> 01:35:18.610
And from day one, as this
field emerged in the late '70s,

01:35:18.610 --> 01:35:20.780
there was a huge
political agenda

01:35:20.780 --> 01:35:22.320
that was assumed to be there.

01:35:22.320 --> 01:35:27.720
Sufficiently so at one lecture,
a famous conference in 1977

01:35:27.720 --> 01:35:31.060
where EO Wilson was presenting
there, a bunch of people

01:35:31.060 --> 01:35:33.160
rushed the stage and
knocked him off the stage

01:35:33.160 --> 01:35:35.470
and dumped water
on him and chanted,

01:35:35.470 --> 01:35:37.530
whatever it is in German,
saying, we will have

01:35:37.530 --> 01:35:39.860
a society of law and order.

01:35:39.860 --> 01:35:42.376
This is pretty
agitated circumstances

01:35:42.376 --> 01:35:43.500
for thinking about science.

01:35:43.500 --> 01:35:45.290
This was a group in
Boston called Science

01:35:45.290 --> 01:35:48.050
for the People, which was
a Marxist group at the time

01:35:48.050 --> 01:35:50.950
there, and saying, all
this sociobiological stuff

01:35:50.950 --> 01:35:55.070
is doing is justifying a world
in which it is male-dominated,

01:35:55.070 --> 01:35:58.720
stratified, and where aggression
and competition pays off.

01:35:58.720 --> 01:36:00.870
And this has been
highly controversial

01:36:00.870 --> 01:36:02.430
from the beginning.

01:36:02.430 --> 01:36:06.580
The one counter to it-- and I
think a lot of that was valid,

01:36:06.580 --> 01:36:08.630
and I think a lot of
it instead defaults

01:36:08.630 --> 01:36:11.710
into models where this is not
making a whole lot of sense.

01:36:11.710 --> 01:36:13.510
The one thing to
be pointed out is,

01:36:13.510 --> 01:36:16.750
when we see what punctuated
equilibrium is about,

01:36:16.750 --> 01:36:19.920
it's exactly the sort
of world of evolution

01:36:19.920 --> 01:36:22.970
that produces the sort of world
that a Gould or a Lewontin

01:36:22.970 --> 01:36:26.550
would want it to be, one
which minimizes competition

01:36:26.550 --> 01:36:30.710
in favor of cooperation and
a whole pattern of stasis

01:36:30.710 --> 01:36:33.110
and rapid dialectical change.

01:36:33.110 --> 01:36:36.040
It's exactly the world that
two Marxist geneticists would

01:36:36.040 --> 01:36:37.826
say evolution should be about.

01:36:37.826 --> 01:36:39.450
So I think that as
a first pass, you're

01:36:39.450 --> 01:36:44.120
seeing this stuff is dripping
in sociopolitical implications.

01:36:44.120 --> 01:36:47.700
So starting Monday, we will look
at this punctuated equilibrium,

01:36:47.700 --> 01:36:49.930
taking apart this
piece of the story.

01:36:49.930 --> 01:36:54.390
And basically, for the rest
of the course, examining--

01:36:54.390 --> 01:36:57.660
