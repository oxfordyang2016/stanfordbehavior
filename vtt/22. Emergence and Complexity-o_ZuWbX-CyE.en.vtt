00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:05.830
Stanford University.

00:00:12.597 --> 00:00:15.940
OK, so we will pick up on
the one topic that was not

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.120
covered from two days ago
because you guys needed

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.520
to go play around with these
cellular automata first.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.120
So I will work
with the assumption

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.740
that everybody
here has now spent

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.380
48 hours playing with those.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.352
But presumably because
of the sleep deprivation,

00:00:31.352 --> 00:00:32.810
you've forgotten
much of it by now.

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:34.910
So we will cover some of it.

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:40.800
OK, back to that issue
of fractals and butterfly

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.210
effects and that whole
business that, by the time

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.340
you look at chaotic
systems that are

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.460
determinist but
aperiodical, that, when

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.030
they seem to be lines
crossing, getting back

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.660
into the same spot,
look closely enough

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.624
and they're not going
to actually be touching.

00:00:56.624 --> 00:00:59.200
And the centerpiece
of why that matters

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.920
was that whole
business of, these

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.190
both appear to be the same.

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:04.610
And take them out
a decimal place

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:05.901
and they're actually different.

00:01:05.901 --> 00:01:08.030
And a gazillion
decimal places out.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.840
And the entire sort of rationale
for thinking in that way

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.960
is the notion that a very
small difference here

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.560
can make a difference
one step to the left.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.380
And a million decimal places
out there, a small difference,

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.560
will make a difference
one before that.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.040
In a scale-free way, a fractal,
this here, a difference here,

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.950
a million decimal places
out is just as likely

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.710
to have consequences for
one over as this one for one

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.310
over fractal, scale
free, all of that.

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.150
But the critical thing
that is encompassed in this

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.400
is the notion that
tiny little differences

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.010
can have consequences
that magnify and magnify

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.080
and amplify into a
butterfly effect.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.020
So cellular automata
are a great way

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.870
of seeing this principle along
with a number of others that

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:03.330
are relevant to all of this.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.430
OK, so we start off
with the very first one.

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.410
And this is the one
that you no doubt first

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.530
discovered is a pattern,
which made you deeply happy.

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.490
And if you follow
the rules, it was

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.650
starting there-- was this--
which way is this facing,

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:18.610
starting at the bottom.

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.570
OK, this is starting
at the bottom.

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.540
And what you see is
these very simple rules.

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.290
And out of it emerges a
whole complex pattern.

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.600
And we'll be seeing
shortly the features

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.470
of this that perfectly match
what the requirements are

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.540
for emergent complexity.

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.230
But we'll see as the elements
are lots of constituents,

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.850
lots of building blocks.

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.370
The building blocks
being very simple.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.230
They're binary.

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.330
Either they are
filled or not filled.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.420
Extremely simple rules as to
how the next generation gets

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.250
formed.

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.680
And in terms of the extremely
simple rules, none of the rules

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.980
have anything to do with other
than the next generation.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.370
It is all local rules built
around what the neighborhood is

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:14.810
like for each one of these.

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.530
So you put it
together, and out come

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.960
these very structured
patterns like these.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.470
And this is great.

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.070
This is very exciting.

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:25.350
Except this isn't
what you usually get.

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.180
In most of these cellular
automata systems, where

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.160
you start off with an initial
condition and a simple set

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.470
of local neighbor rules for
how you get reproduction

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.500
into the next
generations, in most cases

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.190
the patterns stop after a while.

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.420
In the vast majority,
they stop, they

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.868
hit a wall, they go extinct.

00:03:45.868 --> 00:03:47.540
Aha.

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:48.980
Two terms that
I've already stuck

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.510
in here that are
biological metaphors

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.420
start to seem less
metaphorical after a while.

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.250
First off, the notion that
going from here to here to here

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.880
to here represents
each next generation.

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.900
And the notion that,
as we were just now,

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.990
that the vast majority of
these cellular automata systems

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:09.150
go extinct.

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.150
They fail after a while.

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.210
So it's a very small subset.

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:16.220
What you then also
see is-- in some ways

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.300
the critical point in
this whole business--

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:22.680
is the relatively small
number of starting states

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.410
that succeed produce a
remarkably small number

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:32.940
of mature states that all look
very similar to each other.

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.390
In other words, you can
start with a whole bunch

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:40.010
of different conditions,
and you will wind up

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:44.040
with a bunch of smaller number
of stereotypical patterns.

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.150
Half of the cellular
automata that

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.100
wind up taking
off look something

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:49.810
like this with this pattern.

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:51.120
What are we seeing?

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.670
Convergence.

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:53.770
Convergence.

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:58.190
The notion that you can start
with different forms and they

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:00.040
will converge over time.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.710
What's this?

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.080
Well, you just proved you
look at the mature form

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.330
and you can't know
the starting state.

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:10.110
The other thing is, starting
at the beginning just looking

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.520
at this line,
there is no way you

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.260
can tell what it's going to look
like 20 generations from now.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.310
You've got to march through it.

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:20.840
In other words,
the starting state

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.070
gives you no predictive
power about the mature state.

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:26.490
This is a nonlinear system.

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.090
The cellular
automata encapsulates

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:33.000
this, this business that
most of these go extinct.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.610
Only a relatively few number
of mature forms exist.

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:38.420
It shows convergence.

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:40.660
Very different starting
states can converge

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:42.340
into the same sort of patterns.

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:46.060
And minor differences
in the starting state

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:50.530
can extend into very
different consequences.

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:53.400
It shows, in other
words, butterfly effects.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.570
OK, so appreciating this a bit.

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:58.650
So what we did was then
go to example number

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.010
two, where we changed
the starting state

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:02.030
just a little bit here.

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:03.790
We shifted around
some of the boxes.

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:06.570
And what you see is something
that looks roughly the same,

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:07.980
but it's not exactly the same.

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:10.310
But it's the same
general feel to it.

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:11.910
So that's great.

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:15.430
But then we started an
exercise of starting off

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:18.870
with the initial boxes.

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:19.880
This goes that way.

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:24.210
The initial boxes evenly spaced
with one space between them

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:26.120
and applied the
rules from there.

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.540
And this is what you get.

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:32.100
Totally boring, static,
inorganic, inanimate.

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.290
This is what it does
for the rest of time.

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:37.110
What this exercise then
did, going to number four,

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:40.170
is what if we now
spaced two boxes

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:41.810
between each one of these?

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:44.970
And here we have an extinction.

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:46.970
This is one of those
where it hits a wall,

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:49.980
and all the next
lines are empty.

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:53.730
OK, how about three boxes in
between the starting states?

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:56.530
OK, another form of extinction.

00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:59.990
OK, how about four boxes
between the starting states?

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:03.810
And suddenly, something
very dynamic takes off.

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:06.540
Applying the same rules,
and all you've done

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:09.420
is change the spacing
between the starting states.

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:13.830
And look at, for one thing, how
close this was to going extinct

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:17.140
up there on top, how
asymmetrical the pattern is

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:18.100
that comes out.

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:21.792
And this particular one will
stay asymmetrical forever.

00:07:21.792 --> 00:07:24.140
And the ways in
which that generated

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:26.070
something very unexpected.

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:29.040
There is no way you
could sit there a priori

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:33.400
and say, hm, one box in between
generates something that

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:34.350
looks inanimate.

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:35.910
Two boxes, not going to work.

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:36.790
Three boxes, yeah.

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:38.960
Somewhere around four
boxes in between.

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:41.900
That's when dynamic
systems suddenly take off.

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:44.180
There is no way
to have known that

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:47.600
before without marching through
this and actually seeing.

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:51.920
Starting state tells you
nothing about the mature state.

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:54.610
Then we space it even further.

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:58.080
And what we get is
something similar again.

00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:59.270
This one is symmetrical.

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:01.340
It is somewhat different
from the previous one,

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:03.430
but it's the same
sorts of patterns

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:05.390
that come up over and over.

00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:08.400
So what we've seen here
is, by starting state,

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:11.310
minor differences,
big divergence

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:15.600
between going extinct versus
being a viable pattern.

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:18.390
Minor differences in starting
state, big divergence

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:21.110
between symmetrical and
asymmetrical patterns.

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:24.800
Tiny differences,
butterfly effects.

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:26.680
OK, next.

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:35.539
Looking at the consequences here
of introducing some asymmetry

00:08:35.539 --> 00:08:36.539
from the very beginning.

00:08:36.539 --> 00:08:42.020
The one on the left up on top
has four boxes and four boxes.

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:43.289
It has eight boxes.

00:08:43.289 --> 00:08:46.620
The one on top has eight boxes
on the left, and the one on top

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:49.660
on the right, just adding in
one extra box on the side,

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:50.910
so it's four and five.

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:53.690
Adding a little asymmetry,
and what you see

00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:55.950
is a very different pattern.

00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:57.690
And one of the things
you tend to see

00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:03.020
in these pseudo-animate living
pattern systems is starting

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:06.850
states of asymmetry produce
more dynamic systems,

00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:10.930
more dynamic patterns than
even symmetrical ones.

00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:14.320
That's one of the only rules
that comes out of there.

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:17.940
So we're seeing now minor
little differences producing

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:20.400
major different consequences.

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:23.780
Divergencies, butterfly effects.

00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:27.945
Now showing this
in a different way.

00:09:27.945 --> 00:09:34.520
And what we've got here are
four different starting state

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:35.720
conditions.

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:37.220
The one on the far
left is, in fact,

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:39.380
the one from the previous
one, the four and four.

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:41.430
Four different starting
state conditions

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:44.504
where they're not enormously
related to each other.

00:09:44.504 --> 00:09:46.920
The first one against the other
three, but the other three

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.230
have minor differences.

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:50.210
And the whole thing
is, two of these

00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:54.040
are identical after the
first 20 generations or so.

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:57.170
This one and this one.

00:09:57.170 --> 00:09:59.830
The two of them are
identical, and for the rest

00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:01.880
of the universe
they will produce

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:03.600
the same identical pattern.

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:07.780
And looking at the mature
state, you show up on the scene

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:11.570
somewhere halfway down, and
you could never ever know

00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:13.210
what the starting state was.

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:16.550
Did it start like this or
did it start like this?

00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:18.680
A convergency here.

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:21.044
And in this case, it's
another one of those rules.

00:10:21.044 --> 00:10:22.710
Knowing the starting
state doesn't allow

00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:24.230
you to predict the mature form.

00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:27.090
Knowing the mature
form, you don't

00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:30.080
know which particular starting
state brought it about.

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:31.790
And the only way
to figure it out

00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:35.030
is to stepwise go
through the whole process

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:39.040
because you can't just
iterate by a blueprint.

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:39.960
There is no blueprint.

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:44.250
Finally, the last
one was giving you,

00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:46.330
instead of different
starting boxes

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:49.420
in each case with the
same reproduction rule,

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:51.610
the last one was the
same starting pattern

00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:54.340
of boxes with
different, slightly

00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:56.160
different, reproductive rules.

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:59.950
And what you see here are
totally different outcomes,

00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:01.430
depending on which variant.

00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:04.000
We have the beloved
one on the top left.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000
And you see here, by slightly
changing the nearest neighbor

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.560
rules, if and only
if there is one

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:12.390
neighbor with this
property, if and only

00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:13.980
if there's two neighbors.

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:15.600
And working through
that way, and you

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:20.350
see remarkably divergent
outcomes for one thing.

00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:22.060
You see that the
majority of them

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:25.770
produce something very
boring, either boring extinct

00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:29.750
or boring repetitive in
a very undynamic way.

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:35.150
Only a small subset
produce lively, animated,

00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:36.652
living systems.

00:11:36.652 --> 00:11:38.860
So we're seeing a whole
bunch of biological metaphors

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:41.857
here over and over and over,
which is the starting states.

00:11:41.857 --> 00:11:43.440
You don't know the
mature, the mature,

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:44.856
you don't know the
starting state.

00:11:44.856 --> 00:11:48.630
The generations, very simple
rules for generations,

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:50.240
going one to the next.

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:52.610
What we see also is
the vast majority

00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:56.540
go extinct and produce,
either go extinct

00:11:56.540 --> 00:12:00.950
or some repetitive, very boring,
crystallized type structure.

00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:03.580
A small subset, a
tiny subset, produce,

00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:05.460
instead, dynamic patterns.

00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:09.000
And knowing what the
starting state is is not

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.140
going to give you any
predictability whatsoever of,

00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:14.740
is this going to produce
a dynamic pattern or not?

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:17.620
Nor does it allow you to look at
a bunch of the starting states

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:20.420
and say, those two
are going to produce

00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:22.680
the same mature pattern.

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:25.820
And these are all
properties of the evolution

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:28.000
of different living systems.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.110
So you begin to see,
OK, cellular automata.

00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:32.620
Do you see some of
these principles?

00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:36.470
The simplest level out
there in the natural world

00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:41.481
is looking at all sorts of
shells, seashells and tortoise

00:12:41.481 --> 00:12:43.870
shells by the seashore
and whatevers.

00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:47.980
And they all have
patterning on them

00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:53.410
that is derived from that
first cellular automata

00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:57.610
rule, producing patterns that
look a whole lot like these.

00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:01.750
And go online and look for them
because I didn't get around

00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:05.400
to it in time, but producing
all sorts of patterns in nature.

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:07.070
Very common ones.

00:13:07.070 --> 00:13:08.420
What does that tell you?

00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:13.420
Very simple rules for generating
the same complex patterns

00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:16.560
and different starting
states, cellular automata

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:19.110
and properties here.

00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:21.850
Another thing in a
living biological system

00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:23.910
that begins to suggest this.

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:28.859
OK, so I do this
research in East Africa.

00:13:28.859 --> 00:13:30.400
And every now and
then over the years

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:32.860
I've gone to this mountain
called Mount Kenya, which

00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:34.250
is on the equator.

00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:36.140
It's about 17,000 feet.

00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:37.770
It's got glaciers up on top.

00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:40.530
So this is an equatorial
glacial mountain.

00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:43.570
And you go up to about
the 15,000-foot zone,

00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:46.910
and there's like--
it's more land.

00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:49.030
Almost everything is dead
up there from the cold.

00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:50.500
And there's
basically only, like,

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:53.580
four or five different
types of plants up there.

00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:57.610
Oh, already a very small
number that survive

00:13:57.610 --> 00:13:58.780
in that environment.

00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:01.820
And each one of them is
very bizarre and distinctive

00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:02.400
looking.

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:03.858
There's one of them
that looks like

00:14:03.858 --> 00:14:06.680
a little, like, rosebud
thing, except it's

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:08.580
about 5 feet across.

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:10.220
And then there's
another one that

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:12.350
has sort of a sprouty
thing like this and then

00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:15.670
a big central cactus-looking
thing that isn't really cactus.

00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:18.240
So there's a few of
these really distinctive,

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:20.060
bizarre-looking plants.

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:22.350
And in some way or
other, that's what

00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:24.650
it takes to survive up there.

00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:28.640
So I have this friend who
does research up in the Andes.

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:30.540
And he does botany
stuff up there.

00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:35.100
And he goes into this one range
there that is on the equator

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:37.410
and high enough that
there's glaciers up there.

00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:40.600
Ah, a glacial equatorial
mountain on the other side

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:41.370
of the globe.

00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:43.110
So one day I'm sitting
around and looking

00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:44.650
at some of his pictures there.

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:48.900
And suddenly I look and say,
that's the exact same plant.

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:52.310
That's the big rosebud plant
that is in Mount Kenya.

00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:54.990
And oh, my god, that's
the tall sprouty one.

00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:56.770
And say, it's the
exact same plant.

00:14:56.770 --> 00:14:58.650
How can that plant
be over there?

00:14:58.650 --> 00:15:02.720
And we go rummage around in
his botany taxonomy stuff,

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:06.090
and they are completely
unrelated plants.

00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:10.120
They are taxonomically of
no connection whatsoever.

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:15.380
But what they've done is
converged onto the same shape.

00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:18.030
And in some mysterious
way, if you're

00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:21.600
going to be a plant growing
on the equator at about

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:25.330
15,000 feet, there's only about
four or five different ways

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:26.460
of appearing.

00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:28.650
There is massive convergence.

00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:30.690
And there's only
four or five ways

00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:33.580
that you can survive an
environment like that.

00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:37.600
You get organisms in
very dry environments,

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:40.570
and there's, like,
only four or five ways

00:15:40.570 --> 00:15:43.080
that you can go about being
an organism that's super

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:45.070
efficient at retaining water.

00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:48.770
And those are the only
ones you see amongst them.

00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:51.970
Desert animals, and
completely unrelated ones,

00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:54.770
have converged onto some
of the same solutions.

00:15:54.770 --> 00:15:56.800
There's only a
very finite number

00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:00.010
of ways to do legs
and locomotion.

00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:04.140
Two is good, four, weirdo
things that fly of six,

00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:05.270
creepy things have eight.

00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:06.860
You don't find seven.

00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:08.200
You don't find three.

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:11.530
You find some of the solutions
here are immensely different

00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:13.690
starting states
and have converged.

00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:17.400
What we see is in these living
systems over and over stuff

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:19.740
that look like
cellular automata,

00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:25.240
where slight differences magnify
enormously butterfly effects,

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:28.930
where you are modeling living
systems in a very real way.

00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:30.540
Most of them go extinct.

00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:32.130
Divergence, convergence.

00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:35.460
And where each one of these
you get the smaller number,

00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:38.890
reflecting the fact that there's
only a limited number of ways

00:16:38.890 --> 00:16:42.850
of doing rain forest,
temperate zone rain forest

00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:44.240
in the Pacific Northwest.

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:46.290
There's only a
limited number of ways

00:16:46.290 --> 00:16:48.920
of doing tundra in Miami Beach.

00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:50.660
There's only a limited
number of ways.

00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:53.080
In all of these,
this convergence,

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:56.800
and always reflecting that
these are cellular automata.

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:57.440
OK.

00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:02.970
So hopefully you are now
feeling desperately regretful

00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:05.480
that you didn't spend the
last few days doing this

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:07.890
because these are
so heartwarming.

00:17:07.890 --> 00:17:10.650
If you want to read a book
that nobody in their right mind

00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:14.550
should read, it's a book by this
guy named Steve Wolfram, who's

00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:19.200
one of the gods of
computers and math

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:21.750
and was one of the sort of
people who first developed

00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:23.829
cellular automata.

00:17:23.829 --> 00:17:26.800
And by all reports
probably one of the largest

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:28.550
egos on the planet.

00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:30.730
And he published a
book, self-published it,

00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:32.580
a few years ago, which
he can because he

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:36.030
is grotesquely wealthy, from
some of his computer programs.

00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:39.500
And just showing what a
low-key sort of humble guy

00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:43.110
he is, he called the book
A New Kind of Science,

00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:46.040
just showing that
he wasn't just going

00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:48.830
from some little piddly new
way of viewing the world,

00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:51.580
but here was his
new type of science.

00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:53.990
And the book is
about 1,200 pages.

00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:55.750
And I suspect not
even his mother

00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:58.580
has read the thing it
is so impenetrable.

00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:00.790
And it sold a gazillion copies.

00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:03.450
And almost all of them are
sitting in people's garages

00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:06.500
now, weighting down drain pipes
because no one can actually

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:07.390
read this thing.

00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:09.830
But an awful lot of
what the book is about

00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:15.710
are patterns in nature coded
for by very simple local rules.

00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:17.560
And the simple fact
of that, you've

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:21.480
got a lot of very smart people
doing this cellular automata

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:22.360
stuff.

00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:24.880
And they can't
come up with rules

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:28.570
where you could look at
something beforehand a priori

00:18:28.570 --> 00:18:31.150
and know this one
is going to survive,

00:18:31.150 --> 00:18:33.390
this one is going to
go extinct, those two

00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:35.270
are going to turn
the same, these two

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:37.360
that differ by a
slight smidgen are

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:39.360
going to turn out to be
enormously different.

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:41.170
There's no rules for it.

00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:43.250
And the book has all
sorts of cool pictures

00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:45.885
of a cellular automata
looking things out in nature.

00:18:45.885 --> 00:18:50.386
And go buy it for
somebody's birthday

00:18:50.386 --> 00:18:52.885
and see if they're not grateful
for the rest of their lives.

00:18:52.885 --> 00:18:55.580
But his whole argument
there is, these

00:18:55.580 --> 00:19:00.080
show ways in which you can code
for a lot of the complexity

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:05.050
in the natural world with
small numbers of simple rules.

00:19:05.050 --> 00:19:08.020
This whole business
of emergence.

00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:09.920
This sets us up
now for beginning

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:11.720
to look at some of
the ways in which we

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:15.180
hit a wall the other day, ways
in which the reductive model

00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:18.190
of understanding the universe
stops working after a while.

00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:20.700
One version being the
problem of not having

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:22.660
enough numbers of things.

00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:25.450
Not having enough
neurons to do grandmother

00:19:25.450 --> 00:19:28.460
neurons beyond Jennifer
Aniston, that whole business

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:30.260
that you simply
don't have enough

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:33.660
neurons to do that beyond just
the rare ones now and then.

00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:35.280
And what do you get instead?

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:37.580
What has the solution
turned out to be?

00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:40.905
This field that people focus
on now called neural networks.

00:19:43.565 --> 00:19:48.400
And the point of neural networks
is that information, again,

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:51.460
is not coded in a single
molecule, single synapse,

00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:53.272
single neuron, one neuron.

00:19:53.272 --> 00:19:55.230
This neuron knows one
thing and one thing only,

00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:57.480
which is when there's
a dot there, instead,

00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:00.150
information is
coded in networks,

00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:03.520
in patterns of
neural activation.

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:05.730
And just to give you
an example, and this is

00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:06.980
one that's in the Zebra book.

00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:09.130
And anyone who is in
Biocore I do this one,

00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:11.710
and I do it because
I at one point

00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:13.960
learned the name of three
impressionist painters,

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:15.240
except they're not
coming to mind right now.

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:16.760
OK, so you've got two layers.

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:18.800
Here's what a neural
network would look like.

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:20.410
A two-layer one.

00:20:20.410 --> 00:20:25.000
These neurons on the bottom
are boring, simple, Hubel and

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.260
Wiesel-type neurons
from the other day,

00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:30.540
where each neuron knows one
thing and one thing only.

00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:34.660
This one knows how to
recognize Gauguin paintings,

00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:38.797
this one recognizes Van
Gogh, and this one Monet.

00:20:38.797 --> 00:20:40.050
OK.

00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:43.090
Each one of them is-- obviously
there is no Hubel and Wiesel

00:20:43.090 --> 00:20:44.870
neuron on Earth
that's like that.

00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:46.410
But just for our purposes.

00:20:46.410 --> 00:20:48.390
They now project up
to this next layer.

00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:52.520
Note this neuron projects
to one, two, and three.

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:54.660
This to two, three, and four.

00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:56.180
This to three, four, and five.

00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:58.800
So what does this
neuron know about?

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:01.160
This one knows how
to recognize Gauguin.

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:04.200
It's only getting
information from this neuron.

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:06.780
It's another one of those
Hubel and Wiesel type,

00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:08.910
I know one fact
and one fact only.

00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:11.840
This one here is
another one of those.

00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:14.830
What does this neuron
know about in the middle?

00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:17.400
That's the neuron that
knows how to recognize

00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:19.220
Impressionist paintings.

00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:21.780
That's the one that
says, I can't tell you

00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:25.150
who the artist is, but it's
one of those Impressionists.

00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:27.230
It's not one of
those Dutch masters.

00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:29.490
It's an Impressionist painting.

00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:33.460
And this one does it because
it is getting information that

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:35.780
is not available to these guys.

00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:39.270
It is getting information
at the intersection

00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:42.100
of all these specific examples.

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:45.150
These ones, number
two and four, those

00:21:45.150 --> 00:21:47.920
are ones that recognize
Impressionist paintings also,

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:50.800
but they're not as accurate
at it as number three

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:53.960
because they've got less
examples to work off of.

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:56.040
This is how a
network would work.

00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:58.890
And what that suddenly
begins to explain

00:21:58.890 --> 00:22:02.800
is something about the human
brain versus a computer.

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:06.840
Computers are amazing at doing
sequential analytical stuff.

00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:10.730
Like, you get calculator
things inside Cheerio boxes

00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:12.860
that can do more things
than the human brain can

00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:14.600
do computationally.

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:17.890
But what we can do is
parallel processing.

00:22:17.890 --> 00:22:22.940
What we can do is patterns,
resemblances, similarities,

00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:26.300
metaphorical similarities,
physical similarities.

00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:29.450
And that's why you need
networks like these.

00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:33.130
You don't need neurons that
know one fact and one fact only.

00:22:33.130 --> 00:22:35.570
You need neurons
where each one of them

00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:38.760
is at the intersection of a
whole bunch of other inputs.

00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:40.270
OK, example.

00:22:40.270 --> 00:22:42.260
So now suppose
you've got a network.

00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:44.590
There's one neuron
which fires, and there's

00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:47.960
a whole bunch of neurons sort
of sending projections into it.

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:51.090
And this is a neuron
for remembering

00:22:51.090 --> 00:22:52.680
the name of that guy.

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:54.020
What was the name of that guy?

00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:56.350
That guy, he was that
Impressionist painter.

00:22:56.350 --> 00:22:58.630
So suddenly your
Impressionist painter network

00:22:58.630 --> 00:23:01.110
is activating and
firing at this neuron.

00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:04.120
So it's sitting there.

00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:08.060
So this is-- now you've got
your whole Impressionist network

00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:08.820
that's activated.

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:10.700
What was the name of that guy?

00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:12.850
He was an Impressionist painter.

00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:16.770
He painted women dancers
a lot of the time.

00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:19.260
So people who painted dancers.

00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:20.640
But it wasn't Degas.

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:23.870
OK, so your "it's not Degas"
circuit going in there.

00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:25.110
And what was that guy's name?

00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:27.240
God, I had that seventh
grade art teacher

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:28.440
who loved this guy's work.

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:31.090
If I could remember her name,
I would remember his name.

00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:33.502
Oh, remember the time
I was at the museum

00:23:33.502 --> 00:23:35.960
and there was that really cute
person who seemed to like it

00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:37.942
and I had to pretend
I liked this guy also

00:23:37.942 --> 00:23:39.400
and it didn't work
out nonetheless?

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:40.160
And going through.

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:41.470
And oh, what's the name?

00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:44.440
There's that stupid pun about
the guy, he's really short.

00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:46.980
And something about the
tracks being too loose.

00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:48.590
Ah, Toulous-Lautrec.

00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:51.520
And suddenly it pops
out there, and you've

00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:54.120
got enough of these
inputs coming in there.

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:57.360
And this is tip of
the tongue wiring.

00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:00.450
This is how you may not
be able to just remember

00:24:00.450 --> 00:24:01.750
the guy's name.

00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:04.500
Wait, he was the short guy
with a beard who hung out

00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:06.730
in bars and Parisian bars.

00:24:06.730 --> 00:24:09.590
And here was that
time in seventh grade.

00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:12.640
And enough of these inputs,
and suddenly out pops

00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:14.040
the information.

00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:16.170
And what this begins
to tell you is,

00:24:16.170 --> 00:24:19.150
this is ways of
getting similarities.

00:24:19.150 --> 00:24:22.370
These are ways of getting
things that vaguely remind you.

00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:25.440
This is a world where
humans can now do stuff

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:27.920
like have a piece of
music that reminds

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:30.280
them of a certain
artist because they

00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:32.810
both have similar coloration.

00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:35.430
And that's something
that makes sense to us.

00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:37.640
That's something that can
work because, what you then

00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:41.370
begin to see is, every one
of these neurons, this one,

00:24:41.370 --> 00:24:43.900
for example,
Impressionist neurons.

00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:47.690
This one may also be at the
intersection of another network

00:24:47.690 --> 00:24:51.980
that's going this way,
a network of French guys

00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:53.460
from the last century.

00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:57.260
And it may be part of
another network of people

00:24:57.260 --> 00:24:58.909
whose names are
hard to pronounce

00:24:58.909 --> 00:25:00.950
so you're anxious about
saying them in a lecture.

00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:03.221
Or the intersection--
and each one of these

00:25:03.221 --> 00:25:05.596
is going to be an intersection
of a whole bunch of these.

00:25:05.596 --> 00:25:08.310
All of these networks,
what does that do?

00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:11.020
That's what you can do
that a computer can't.

00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:14.900
You see similarities,
similes, metaphors.

00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:17.950
And somewhere in there you get
something really important,

00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:23.790
which is the ones, the networks,
that have wider expanses that

00:25:23.790 --> 00:25:26.300
connect to a broader
number of neurons

00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:30.570
in a very simple,
artificial, idiotic way.

00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:33.710
That's kind of what
creativity would have to be,

00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:36.790
networks that are
spreading far wider

00:25:36.790 --> 00:25:39.530
than in some other individual.

00:25:39.530 --> 00:25:42.410
It is literally
making connections

00:25:42.410 --> 00:25:44.950
that neurons in another
individual does not.

00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:48.810
And suddenly you have
a world where everyone

00:25:48.810 --> 00:25:51.220
knows this one is a face.

00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:54.930
And it was only a limited
number of people who ever

00:25:54.930 --> 00:25:56.820
decided that this one's a face.

00:25:56.820 --> 00:26:00.910
And in some level Picasso had
a different network, a broader

00:26:00.910 --> 00:26:04.240
one, as to what could
constitute a face.

00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:07.030
A broader network
in some way is going

00:26:07.030 --> 00:26:11.030
to have to be wiring
that is more divergent.

00:26:11.030 --> 00:26:14.260
And at the intersection
of a bunch of networks

00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:16.412
that are acting in
a convergent way.

00:26:16.412 --> 00:26:18.370
So what's some of the
evidence that it actually

00:26:18.370 --> 00:26:19.850
does work this way?

00:26:19.850 --> 00:26:25.240
You go and you stick electrodes
into neurons in the cortex,

00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:28.960
and what you see, if the
world was entirely made up of,

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:32.650
like Hubel and Wiesel, one
piece of knowledge only, what

00:26:32.650 --> 00:26:35.700
you would see is you would find
neurons that each one responds

00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:37.400
to one single thing.

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:38.900
All these grandmother neurons.

00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:40.830
And instead, what
you see by the time

00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:44.080
you get to the interesting
part of the cortex

00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:47.339
past the first three
layers of the visual cortex

00:26:47.339 --> 00:26:49.130
and the first three
layers of the auditory.

00:26:49.130 --> 00:26:52.180
Once you get into
the 90% that's called

00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:53.895
the associational
cortex-- and it's

00:26:53.895 --> 00:26:55.270
called that because
nobody really

00:26:55.270 --> 00:26:57.910
knows what it does--
then what you see

00:26:57.910 --> 00:27:01.590
are neurons that are
multimodal in their responses.

00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:04.480
All sorts of things
stimulate them.

00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:06.720
And here we have a neuron
that's being stimulated

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:10.470
by a type of painting, by
the knowledge of French guys,

00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:13.160
by something phonetic,
by all sorts--

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:15.330
and they're multiresponsive.

00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:17.350
So that's what you
wind up seeing.

00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:19.530
The majority of
cortical neurons,

00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:21.530
when you record from
them with an electrode,

00:27:21.530 --> 00:27:23.020
they're not grandmother neurons.

00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:25.490
They're at the intersection
of a bunch of nets.

00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:27.140
More evidence for this.

00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:30.390
This was-- one of the grand
poobahs of neuroscience

00:27:30.390 --> 00:27:33.320
around the 1940s or so,
a guy named Karl Lashley.

00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:35.810
And obviously a
very different time

00:27:35.810 --> 00:27:37.900
in terms of thinking about
specification of brain

00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:38.670
function.

00:27:38.670 --> 00:27:42.470
And what he did was a
very systematic attempt

00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:44.930
to be able to show
where in the brain

00:27:44.930 --> 00:27:47.110
individual facts were stored.

00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:50.570
And the term for it at the time,
this jargony term, was engrams.

00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:54.390
He was searching for the
engram for different facts.

00:27:54.390 --> 00:27:56.180
And what he would
show was, he would

00:27:56.180 --> 00:27:59.930
destroy parts of the cortex
in an experimental animal.

00:27:59.930 --> 00:28:02.980
And he couldn't make the
information disappear.

00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:05.220
He would have to
destroy broader areas.

00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:07.150
And some of the knowledge,
some of the memory

00:28:07.150 --> 00:28:08.410
was still in there.

00:28:08.410 --> 00:28:10.630
And he concluded in
this famous paper

00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:12.736
in the search for the
engram that, according

00:28:12.736 --> 00:28:14.110
to all the science
he knew, there

00:28:14.110 --> 00:28:16.370
could be no such
thing as memory.

00:28:16.370 --> 00:28:18.760
And the reason why
was he was working

00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:21.220
with a model of being
able to-- there's

00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:23.860
a single neuron where,
if I could ablate it,

00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:26.200
I should be able to
now show in that rat

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:29.540
that it's just lost the name
of its kindergarten teacher.

00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:33.190
And instead, you see
networks going on.

00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:35.630
You see the same thing
clinically in something

00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:38.190
like people with
Alzheimer's disease.

00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:43.450
Early on in Alzheimer's, you
will lose, in these networks,

00:28:43.450 --> 00:28:46.750
you'll lose a neuron here or
you'll lose a neuron there

00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:48.650
when you're just
beginning to lose neurons.

00:28:48.650 --> 00:28:50.500
And what you see is,
clinically, in people

00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:55.130
with Alzheimer's, early on, it's
not that they forget things.

00:28:55.130 --> 00:28:57.410
It's not that memory is gone.

00:28:57.410 --> 00:28:59.540
It's just harder to get to.

00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:01.820
And you do this with
all sorts of testing,

00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:03.610
neuropsychological
testing, where

00:29:03.610 --> 00:29:07.690
you try to give the person
cues to pull it out.

00:29:07.690 --> 00:29:08.352
Example.

00:29:08.352 --> 00:29:10.560
You're giving somebody,
potentially with Alzheimer's,

00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:12.810
a classic orientation test.

00:29:12.810 --> 00:29:17.320
You ask them, OK, do you know
the name of the president?

00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:18.750
OK, they manage to get that.

00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:20.770
Do you know the name
of the last president?

00:29:20.770 --> 00:29:22.019
No idea.

00:29:22.019 --> 00:29:23.810
So now you give them
a little bit of cuing.

00:29:23.810 --> 00:29:25.184
OK, let me help
you a little bit.

00:29:25.184 --> 00:29:27.320
It's a one-syllable word.

00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:29.150
Still not there, even
though you've now

00:29:29.150 --> 00:29:33.260
activated the one-syllable word
network, obviously artificial.

00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:33.960
Still can't say.

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:35.790
OK, let's make it a
little bit easier.

00:29:35.790 --> 00:29:39.970
It's things you could find
in a park, in a city park.

00:29:39.970 --> 00:29:41.240
So you're activating that.

00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:42.890
No, still not coming out.

00:29:42.890 --> 00:29:45.750
And then you give even more
explicit priming there.

00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:48.450
You give them a forced choice
paradigm, is what it's called.

00:29:48.450 --> 00:29:51.750
OK, so is it President Tree or
President Shrub or President

00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:53.260
Bench or President Bush?

00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:56.000
Bush, Bush, the kid
with the father also.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.600
It's still in there.

00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:58.960
It was still in there.

00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:01.800
It just takes more
work to pull it out.

00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:04.630
What you're seeing
there is not the death

00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:06.780
of individual memories.

00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:10.920
You're seeing a weakening
of a network, a network that

00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:15.280
is now taking stronger priming
to pull it out of there.

00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:18.940
And just to show how subtle
network stuff can be,

00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:21.680
here's something that would
work with a lot of individuals

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:23.290
with early stage dementias.

00:30:23.290 --> 00:30:25.890
What you do is another
type of priming.

00:30:25.890 --> 00:30:27.484
So you're eventually
going to ask

00:30:27.484 --> 00:30:29.150
them the name of the
previous president.

00:30:29.150 --> 00:30:32.300
And they first come in and
you say, oh, great to see you.

00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:32.816
Come on in.

00:30:32.816 --> 00:30:33.690
What a beautiful day.

00:30:33.690 --> 00:30:35.190
I walked here by
way of the park.

00:30:35.190 --> 00:30:37.694
The bushes were so beautiful
this morning in the park.

00:30:37.694 --> 00:30:39.610
Some of them had flowers,
some of them didn't.

00:30:39.610 --> 00:30:41.480
But bushes are so nice
to look at when you're

00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:42.860
walking through a
park because bushes

00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:44.693
are one of my favorite
forms of [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:44.693 --> 00:30:46.500
And then five
minutes later, they

00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:49.880
are more likely to
remember the name Bush

00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:53.290
out of a whole different realm
of more subtle networks you're

00:30:53.290 --> 00:30:54.590
tapping into.

00:30:54.590 --> 00:30:56.920
So all of this is the
beginning of a way

00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:59.960
of solving the problem we
had the other day of not

00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:03.740
enough neurons for them
to be grandmother neurons.

00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:05.160
More solutions.

00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:07.190
We then went to our
next realm of trouble,

00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:10.310
which was the problem of,
there's not enough genes.

00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:12.940
There's not enough genes
in that specific realm

00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:15.730
of explaining bifurcations.

00:31:15.730 --> 00:31:20.150
And there can't be a gene
that specifies, OK, this

00:31:20.150 --> 00:31:22.780
is where you bifurcate if you
were this particular blood

00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:25.730
vessel and a different gene
for this particular bronchial

00:31:25.730 --> 00:31:27.530
and a different
gene for this branch

00:31:27.530 --> 00:31:30.320
of a dendrite and a single--
it can't work that way.

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:31.920
There are not enough genes.

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:34.650
What this introduces
is the idea of there

00:31:34.650 --> 00:31:40.450
being fractal genes,
genes whose instructions

00:31:40.450 --> 00:31:44.000
are ones that are scale free.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:45.660
What do I mean by this?

00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:47.970
OK, here's what a
fractal gene might do.

00:31:47.970 --> 00:31:49.430
So we've got a tube.

00:31:49.430 --> 00:31:52.440
And this is a tube that's going
to be part of a blood vessel

00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:55.470
or a dendrite or a
lung or whatever.

00:31:55.470 --> 00:31:56.670
We've got a tube.

00:31:56.670 --> 00:32:02.660
And the fractal rule here is,
grow this tube in distance,

00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:07.465
grow it until it is five
times longer than it is wide.

00:32:07.465 --> 00:32:10.710
The width, the opening,
and that's the simple rule.

00:32:10.710 --> 00:32:16.075
And the rule is, when it's grown
five times longer, bifurcate.

00:32:16.075 --> 00:32:17.700
So what's going to
happen at that point

00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:19.380
is just gone five times longer.

00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:21.890
And it bifurcates at that point.

00:32:21.890 --> 00:32:25.270
And what you've got is now,
because this is split in two,

00:32:25.270 --> 00:32:27.660
the cross-section is
going to be shorter.

00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:29.560
But you apply the same rule.

00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:31.960
Now with the shorter
cross-section,

00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:32.940
you have the same rule.

00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:35.840
Grow five times the length
of that cross-section

00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:37.200
until you split.

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:39.510
And what you wind
up getting is, this

00:32:39.510 --> 00:32:43.430
is one simple fractal rule
that will generate the tree

00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:44.250
patterns.

00:32:44.250 --> 00:32:46.790
That the branchings get
shorter and shorter,

00:32:46.790 --> 00:32:48.610
the distances between
the branch points

00:32:48.610 --> 00:32:51.070
get shorter and shorter
because the cross-sections are

00:32:51.070 --> 00:32:54.300
getting-- one simple rule
and you could generate

00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:56.860
a circulatory system,
a pulmonary system,

00:32:56.860 --> 00:33:01.090
and a dendritic tree by
giving a fractal instruction,

00:33:01.090 --> 00:33:04.110
in this case, one
that is scale free.

00:33:04.110 --> 00:33:06.980
That is, independent of
what the unit is here.

00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:09.080
And this could work
within the single neuron

00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:12.710
or within an entire
circulatory system.

00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:13.810
So all of that's great.

00:33:13.810 --> 00:33:15.670
That's totally hypothetical.

00:33:15.670 --> 00:33:17.375
Ooh, fractal genes.

00:33:17.375 --> 00:33:19.250
Well, you know by now
that's got to translate

00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:21.440
into a protein in
some way or other.

00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:26.370
How might this actually
look in a real system?

00:33:26.370 --> 00:33:35.350
So suppose-- OK, so a
gene coding for a protein.

00:33:35.350 --> 00:33:37.674
This is one copy of the
protein, this is another,

00:33:37.674 --> 00:33:38.340
this is another.

00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:41.930
They bind to each other in a
way so that they form a tube.

00:33:41.930 --> 00:33:43.870
And they bind to
each other in a way

00:33:43.870 --> 00:33:47.570
that's just pure mechanical
reality of, these are not

00:33:47.570 --> 00:33:50.470
bits of information,
these are actual proteins.

00:33:50.470 --> 00:33:52.090
So it's going up
in the tube there.

00:33:52.090 --> 00:33:55.450
And suppose that the forces
are, as the tube goes up

00:33:55.450 --> 00:33:57.220
it gets more and more unstable.

00:33:57.220 --> 00:33:59.180
And when the tube
is high enough,

00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:02.610
it gets unstable
enough that these bonds

00:34:02.610 --> 00:34:06.980
between the proteins begin to
weaken, and it begins to split.

00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:09.010
The splitting
there is a function

00:34:09.010 --> 00:34:10.480
of the length of these.

00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:11.429
So it's split.

00:34:11.429 --> 00:34:13.830
And now the next one
has half the number

00:34:13.830 --> 00:34:17.679
of proteins in this one, and
thus it's that much weaker.

00:34:17.679 --> 00:34:20.360
So you only have to go
a shorter distance now

00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:22.234
before it begins to split.

00:34:22.234 --> 00:34:23.425
This doesn't exist.

00:34:23.425 --> 00:34:25.090
It is no way it's like this.

00:34:25.090 --> 00:34:27.110
But what you could
begin to see is,

00:34:27.110 --> 00:34:31.150
here's how you could turn a
scale-free set of instructions

00:34:31.150 --> 00:34:33.010
potentially into what
it would actually

00:34:33.010 --> 00:34:36.590
look like with mortar and
bricks in terms of proteins.

00:34:36.590 --> 00:34:38.402
How it might actually work.

00:34:38.402 --> 00:34:42.860
Now the notion of fractal
genetics, of fractal genes,

00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:46.620
and fractal instructions begins
to solve another problem,

00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:50.170
and this is that space problem
of how much stuff can you

00:34:50.170 --> 00:34:52.260
jam into a space.

00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:57.290
Here's the challenge here in
terms of how dense things are.

00:34:57.290 --> 00:35:00.970
In the body-- amazing factoid--
there is no cell in your body

00:35:00.970 --> 00:35:05.520
that is more than five cells
away from a blood vessel.

00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:07.910
OK, you could see why you
would want to do that.

00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:10.602
But that is not an
easy thing to pull off.

00:35:10.602 --> 00:35:12.560
How do you do that with
the circulatory system?

00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:14.870
And amazing other
factoid to factor in

00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:20.610
with that is, the circulatory
system comprises less than 5%

00:35:20.610 --> 00:35:22.580
of your body mass.

00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:24.250
How can this be?

00:35:24.250 --> 00:35:29.030
You've got this system
that's everywhere.

00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:31.370
But it's taking up
almost no space.

00:35:31.370 --> 00:35:34.450
It's within five cells
of every cell out there,

00:35:34.450 --> 00:35:36.770
yet it's less than
5% of the body.

00:35:36.770 --> 00:35:38.242
And, OK, forget it.

00:35:38.242 --> 00:35:39.450
I'm not going to put that up.

00:35:39.450 --> 00:35:44.260
But what this begins to--
OK, you convinced me.

00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:45.080
So let's do this.

00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:52.030
So what you begin
to do is transition

00:35:52.030 --> 00:35:56.000
to a world of fractal geometry.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:01.820
You've got all your Euclidean
world of nice, smiley, strange

00:36:01.820 --> 00:36:02.640
things there.

00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:07.110
You've got this
whole world of shapes

00:36:07.110 --> 00:36:11.020
that are constrained by classic
Cartesian geometry and all

00:36:11.020 --> 00:36:11.540
of that.

00:36:11.540 --> 00:36:15.230
And what fractal geometry
generates are objects that

00:36:15.230 --> 00:36:17.400
simply cannot exist.

00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:19.500
Here up on top,
eventually, you will

00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:21.100
see the first example of this.

00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:22.760
And this is out
of the Chaos book.

00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:25.280
And this is this cantor set.

00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:28.060
What you do is you
start with a line.

00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:31.470
Start with a line, and you
cut out the middle third.

00:36:31.470 --> 00:36:33.330
Now for those
remaining two ones,

00:36:33.330 --> 00:36:34.810
you cut out the middle third.

00:36:34.810 --> 00:36:37.614
For those remaining four,
you cut out the middle third.

00:36:37.614 --> 00:36:39.020
And there it is.

00:36:39.020 --> 00:36:41.790
And you just keep doing this
over and over and over again.

00:36:41.790 --> 00:36:44.940
And what do you do when you
take it out to infinity?

00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:46.660
What have you generated?

00:36:46.660 --> 00:36:51.460
A set of an infinitely
large number of objects,

00:36:51.460 --> 00:36:54.520
lines, that take up an
infinitely small amount

00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:55.560
of space.

00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:58.370
It's not possible for
that to work, yet,

00:36:58.370 --> 00:37:00.140
as you go more and
more in that direction,

00:37:00.140 --> 00:37:03.060
you get this
impossible phenomenon

00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:06.560
of something approaching having
an infinite number of places

00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:09.970
that something appears while
taking up almost an infinitely

00:37:09.970 --> 00:37:11.870
small amount of space.

00:37:11.870 --> 00:37:16.640
And what this winds up being is,
it's not quite a line anymore

00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:19.430
at the bottom, but it's
kind of more than a dot.

00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:22.640
It's somewhere between
one and two dimensions.

00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:24.160
It's a fractal.

00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:26.700
Its dimensional
state is somewhere

00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:28.570
one point something or other.

00:37:28.570 --> 00:37:31.440
It is somewhere between
dots and a line,

00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:33.620
and it does this
impossible thing,

00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:38.135
which is it's everywhere
without taking up any space.

00:37:38.135 --> 00:37:41.080
Or you could then push
it to the same thing

00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:42.430
in the next dimension.

00:37:42.430 --> 00:37:44.460
And this is this Koch snowflake.

00:37:44.460 --> 00:37:46.060
And it's the same sort of rule.

00:37:46.060 --> 00:37:48.830
You start with the
triangle there.

00:37:48.830 --> 00:37:52.010
And the rule is, you
take the middle third

00:37:52.010 --> 00:37:54.490
and you put a little
triangle out of it.

00:37:54.490 --> 00:37:56.150
And then take the
middle third of that

00:37:56.150 --> 00:37:57.589
and put a little triangle out.

00:37:57.589 --> 00:37:58.380
And a middle third.

00:37:58.380 --> 00:38:00.588
And you just keep doing it
forever and ever and ever.

00:38:00.588 --> 00:38:03.640
And you wind up with
something that is impossible,

00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:08.970
which is an object that has an
infinite amount of perimeter,

00:38:08.970 --> 00:38:13.670
an infinite amount of surface
area, within a finite space.

00:38:13.670 --> 00:38:15.070
That's impossible.

00:38:15.070 --> 00:38:17.240
But it begins to approach this.

00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:19.080
And what you see
here, this is a way

00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:21.600
of just iterating over
and over and over to jam

00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:25.860
a huge amount of surface
area into a tiny space.

00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:30.290
And thus it's somewhere but
different, sort of like a line,

00:38:30.290 --> 00:38:32.580
but it's sort of
like a plane by then.

00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:34.960
And it's got a
fractal form somewhere

00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:36.730
between two and three.

00:38:36.730 --> 00:38:40.240
It's got a fractal quality of
two point something or other.

00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:43.320
It's an impossible
object that is solving

00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:46.110
this problem of being--
in another version,

00:38:46.110 --> 00:38:50.910
having surface area everywhere
without taking up any space

00:38:50.910 --> 00:38:53.060
and being within a finite area.

00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:55.210
Next, finally,
this Menger sponge,

00:38:55.210 --> 00:38:56.990
which is the same exact concept.

00:38:56.990 --> 00:39:00.620
Again, you start with the
box up there, or the ring,

00:39:00.620 --> 00:39:03.100
and you take out
the middle third

00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:04.357
of each of those segments.

00:39:04.357 --> 00:39:05.940
And then you take
out the middle third

00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:07.130
of each of those segments.

00:39:07.130 --> 00:39:09.150
And if you are doing
this with what starts off

00:39:09.150 --> 00:39:12.160
as a three-dimensional cube,
eventually you get something

00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:17.690
that cannot exist, which is an
object that has an infinitely

00:39:17.690 --> 00:39:22.260
large amount of surface
area while having no volume.

00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:24.870
That's what it produces
at the extreme.

00:39:24.870 --> 00:39:27.980
And we got something here
that's somewhere between two

00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:30.480
different dimensions,
a fractal again.

00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:34.490
And what you see is, this is
how the body solves the packing

00:39:34.490 --> 00:39:35.310
problem.

00:39:35.310 --> 00:39:41.960
Because all you need to do is
make the circulatory system,

00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:44.530
the circulatory system
some version of this,

00:39:44.530 --> 00:39:47.120
some version of splitting
the ends of the capillaries

00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:50.740
over and over and over or making
the lungs, with their surface

00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:54.820
area for exchanging oxygen,
looking something like this.

00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:57.200
And this is how you
generate a system that

00:39:57.200 --> 00:40:00.490
is everywhere and taking
up virtually no space.

00:40:00.490 --> 00:40:02.640
Obviously, it's not
taken out to infinity.

00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:05.340
But this is how you can have
a circulatory system that's

00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:07.580
five cells away from
every cell in the body,

00:40:07.580 --> 00:40:11.000
yet takes up less
than 5% of the body.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:13.570
This is a fractal solution.

00:40:13.570 --> 00:40:15.970
All you do here
to generate these

00:40:15.970 --> 00:40:17.620
is taking some of
these qualities

00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:19.350
over and over and
over and over, and you

00:40:19.350 --> 00:40:23.840
can begin to produce absolutely
bizarre, impossible things

00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:27.530
in terms of surface area
and perimeter and volume

00:40:27.530 --> 00:40:28.540
and all of that.

00:40:28.540 --> 00:40:31.060
This is how you can
use a fractal system

00:40:31.060 --> 00:40:33.362
to solve the packing problem.

00:40:33.362 --> 00:40:35.390
Now of course, as soon
as you're coming up

00:40:35.390 --> 00:40:38.370
with the notion of something
like fractal genes,

00:40:38.370 --> 00:40:42.730
you, of course, have to consider
the possibility of there

00:40:42.730 --> 00:40:44.830
being fractal mutations.

00:40:44.830 --> 00:40:47.580
What would a fractal
mutation look like?

00:40:47.580 --> 00:40:50.040
And again, most people,
most geneticists

00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:51.670
and molecular
people, do not think

00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:53.040
about this in these terms.

00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:56.050
But there are people who do
who actually talk about things

00:40:56.050 --> 00:40:57.950
like fractal gene mutations.

00:40:57.950 --> 00:40:59.320
What would it look like?

00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:03.840
Suppose you've got a mutation,
and it produces a protein

00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:05.870
that's slightly different.

00:41:05.870 --> 00:41:08.900
And as a result,
its got bonds here

00:41:08.900 --> 00:41:13.000
that are slightly weaker
between different proteins.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.540
So on a mechanical level,
what have we just defined?

00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:18.970
This is a tube that's going
to grow these proteins where

00:41:18.970 --> 00:41:22.220
it's a shorter distance
before it begins to split.

00:41:22.220 --> 00:41:25.010
Because these bonds between
them are not as strong.

00:41:25.010 --> 00:41:27.170
There is a mutation
now where, instead

00:41:27.170 --> 00:41:30.590
of growing five times
the cross-section, maybe

00:41:30.590 --> 00:41:34.010
you're growing 4.9
times the cross-section.

00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:37.660
And thanks to that mutation,
the entire branching system

00:41:37.660 --> 00:41:39.590
is going to be compacted a bit.

00:41:39.590 --> 00:41:42.570
It's not going to
reach the target cells.

00:41:42.570 --> 00:41:46.140
And these would be
catastrophic mutations where

00:41:46.140 --> 00:41:47.830
the pulmonary system
doesn't develop,

00:41:47.830 --> 00:41:50.040
the circulatory system
doesn't develop.

00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:52.620
And what you would
see in those cases is,

00:41:52.620 --> 00:41:55.260
the mutation is something
that has consequences

00:41:55.260 --> 00:41:57.000
that are scale free.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:00.650
Another hint when you see some
fractal gene mutations are

00:42:00.650 --> 00:42:03.350
a small number of
diseases that they're

00:42:03.350 --> 00:42:06.950
about spatial
relationships in the body.

00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:10.090
For example, there's a disease
called Kallmann syndrome, where

00:42:10.090 --> 00:42:14.990
you get stuff that's wrong with
midline structures in the body.

00:42:14.990 --> 00:42:16.730
Something is wrong
with the septum

00:42:16.730 --> 00:42:19.650
between the nose, the nostrils.

00:42:19.650 --> 00:42:21.810
Something is wrong
in the hypothalamus.

00:42:21.810 --> 00:42:24.780
Something is wrong in
the septum of the heart.

00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:26.760
This is not three
different mutations.

00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:29.910
This is some sort of
fractal mutation messing up

00:42:29.910 --> 00:42:33.840
how that embryo did
symmetry, how the embryo does

00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:35.380
midline structures.

00:42:35.380 --> 00:42:37.290
So you begin to see
ways here in which

00:42:37.290 --> 00:42:40.930
you can solve this and, within
the biological metaphor,

00:42:40.930 --> 00:42:44.580
where you could begin to get
solutions for these problems

00:42:44.580 --> 00:42:47.300
and also mutations that
can put you up the creek.

00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:48.070
OK.

00:42:48.070 --> 00:42:51.010
So that is another realm
for beginning to solve this.

00:42:51.010 --> 00:42:52.400
Another domain.

00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:55.850
And here we begin to move
into the realm of emergence,

00:42:55.850 --> 00:42:57.640
emergent complexity.

00:42:57.640 --> 00:43:01.390
Which we will first look at a
couple of crude passes at it.

00:43:01.390 --> 00:43:05.390
First, emergence driven
by biophysical properties.

00:43:05.390 --> 00:43:07.190
And do not freak
out if you don't

00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:09.860
know what I mean because I have
no idea what I mean by that.

00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:12.420
So I will explain in
a more accessible way.

00:43:12.420 --> 00:43:15.720
And this was something that
was explained endlessly

00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:17.330
by a guy who used
to be in the bio

00:43:17.330 --> 00:43:21.010
department, a developmental
botanist named Paul Green, who

00:43:21.010 --> 00:43:23.890
died about 10 years ago
way too young from cancer.

00:43:23.890 --> 00:43:25.570
He was a really good guy.

00:43:25.570 --> 00:43:28.290
He would give this
famous lecture

00:43:28.290 --> 00:43:30.830
where he would start
off and he would

00:43:30.830 --> 00:43:33.170
describe some sort of disk.

00:43:33.170 --> 00:43:36.830
And the point is that the
disk, the material inside

00:43:36.830 --> 00:43:41.610
was of a softer material than
the material on the perimeter.

00:43:41.610 --> 00:43:43.440
And he'd be putting
up math at this point

00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:44.720
that I didn't understand.

00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:46.450
But it was sort of
a disk like that.

00:43:46.450 --> 00:43:51.740
And then he would show that what
happens if you heat the system.

00:43:51.740 --> 00:43:54.274
What happens if you put
heat on a disk like this?

00:43:54.274 --> 00:43:55.690
And what he would
wind up showing,

00:43:55.690 --> 00:43:58.570
going through agonizing
amounts of math,

00:43:58.570 --> 00:44:01.990
is that, when you heat a
system, the only solution

00:44:01.990 --> 00:44:04.450
for this system that's
trying to respond to the heat

00:44:04.450 --> 00:44:07.450
but in different ways on the
perimeter versus the inside

00:44:07.450 --> 00:44:11.910
is to come up with a double
saddle, a double saddle shape.

00:44:11.910 --> 00:44:13.181
And the math proved this.

00:44:13.181 --> 00:44:15.680
And I had no idea what he was
talking about when you come up

00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:18.050
with a double saddle shape.

00:44:18.050 --> 00:44:20.550
And then what he says
is, so that's how

00:44:20.550 --> 00:44:23.410
you get a potato chip.

00:44:23.410 --> 00:44:25.410
You take a slice
of potato, where

00:44:25.410 --> 00:44:27.520
there is more resistance
on the perimeter

00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:29.640
and less on the inside,
and you heat it.

00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:31.770
And the only solution
to the problem

00:44:31.770 --> 00:44:35.510
is to come up with a double
saddle potato chip shape.

00:44:35.510 --> 00:44:38.350
And if you change the
outside, the force of it,

00:44:38.350 --> 00:44:40.530
if you take one of
those great organic,

00:44:40.530 --> 00:44:42.550
"give you the runs"
type potato chips,

00:44:42.550 --> 00:44:45.540
where it's going to have the
skin left on the outside,

00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:48.520
it's going to be a somewhat
different-shaped double saddle.

00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:51.130
Because there's
only one solution

00:44:51.130 --> 00:44:52.920
mathematically to that.

00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:54.580
And then you sit
there, and you deal

00:44:54.580 --> 00:44:56.080
with a very simple,
important fact,

00:44:56.080 --> 00:45:00.460
which is, that slice of
potato knows no biophysics.

00:45:00.460 --> 00:45:02.010
That slice of potato didn't fit.

00:45:02.010 --> 00:45:05.200
There's no gene that
instructs potatoes

00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:07.040
to respond to heat in this way.

00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:11.100
This was the inevitable outcome
of the biophysical properties

00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:12.930
of a slice of potato.

00:45:12.930 --> 00:45:15.810
And what he then shows
is, in plant systems

00:45:15.810 --> 00:45:17.860
after plant systems,
they develop

00:45:17.860 --> 00:45:20.000
where two shoots
come out this way

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:21.470
and a little higher
up two shoots

00:45:21.470 --> 00:45:23.540
this way and two this
way and two this way.

00:45:23.540 --> 00:45:25.360
They're all double saddles.

00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:28.300
And this winds up being
a mathematical solution

00:45:28.300 --> 00:45:29.980
to a packing problem there.

00:45:29.980 --> 00:45:32.230
When plants are
growing their stems,

00:45:32.230 --> 00:45:35.000
there is no gene specifying it.

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.140
You don't need
genetic instructions.

00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:41.060
It is an emergent property
of the physical constraints

00:45:41.060 --> 00:45:43.160
of the system.

00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:47.600
Another example here that's
sort of proto-emergent, somewhat

00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:49.620
simpler versions,
this phenomenon

00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:51.280
of wisdom of the crowd.

00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:53.070
And this is one that
was first identified

00:45:53.070 --> 00:45:56.700
by Francis Galton, who was
some relative of Darwin

00:45:56.700 --> 00:46:00.000
and started eugenics and
was bad news in that regard

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:01.570
but famous statistician.

00:46:01.570 --> 00:46:04.580
And being an Englishman
somewhere in the 19th century,

00:46:04.580 --> 00:46:08.310
he spent huge amounts of time
going to state fairs and county

00:46:08.310 --> 00:46:09.210
fairs or whatever.

00:46:09.210 --> 00:46:11.130
And he was at this
fair one day where

00:46:11.130 --> 00:46:14.120
they had some oxen up there.

00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:16.890
And they were having a contest
that, if you could guess

00:46:16.890 --> 00:46:19.480
the exact weight of
the oxen, you would

00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:21.289
get to milk it or something.

00:46:21.289 --> 00:46:22.830
I don't know what
the prize would be.

00:46:22.830 --> 00:46:24.550
And there were
hundreds of farmers

00:46:24.550 --> 00:46:26.409
around filling out
little pieces of paper

00:46:26.409 --> 00:46:27.450
where they were guessing.

00:46:27.450 --> 00:46:28.970
And what he
discovered at the end

00:46:28.970 --> 00:46:31.670
was that nobody got
the answer right.

00:46:31.670 --> 00:46:32.180
Good.

00:46:32.180 --> 00:46:34.260
So the owners of
this get off easy

00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:36.360
without having to give up
any of their oxen milk.

00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:38.900
But he then did
something interesting.

00:46:38.900 --> 00:46:41.980
He collected all the
little slips of paper,

00:46:41.980 --> 00:46:43.990
and he averaged all of them.

00:46:43.990 --> 00:46:47.780
And it came out to the correct
weight within an ounce.

00:46:47.780 --> 00:46:51.210
In other words, no
individual in that group

00:46:51.210 --> 00:46:54.640
had enough knowledge to be
able to truly accurately tell

00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:55.790
what this thing was.

00:46:55.790 --> 00:46:57.980
But put them
together in a crowd,

00:46:57.980 --> 00:47:00.970
and out comes the right answer.

00:47:00.970 --> 00:47:02.350
Another version of this.

00:47:02.350 --> 00:47:05.250
And this one is deeply
important in terms

00:47:05.250 --> 00:47:07.230
of Western
intellectual tradition.

00:47:07.230 --> 00:47:10.120
Back to-- is that program Who
Wants to Marry a Millionaire?,

00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:11.701
does that still exist?

00:47:11.701 --> 00:47:12.200
[INAUDIBLE]

00:47:13.090 --> 00:47:14.425
In reruns?

00:47:14.425 --> 00:47:18.780
In-- OK, so it was this one.

00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:21.110
They give you questions,
and if you answer them

00:47:21.110 --> 00:47:22.964
they give you money
and it's great.

00:47:22.964 --> 00:47:25.630
And at various points, if you're
stumped you've got three things

00:47:25.630 --> 00:47:26.171
you could do.

00:47:26.171 --> 00:47:29.047
One is, they could eliminate--
you've got four choices.

00:47:29.047 --> 00:47:30.630
They can eliminate
two of them to make

00:47:30.630 --> 00:47:32.200
it a little bit easier for you.

00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:35.490
Another is, you have this
expert who you can call up.

00:47:35.490 --> 00:47:38.760
And the third option is
to ask the audience what

00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:40.144
they think is the right answer.

00:47:40.144 --> 00:47:42.310
And all the audience there
has these little buttons,

00:47:42.310 --> 00:47:45.880
so they can choose A, B, C, or
D of the multiple choice there.

00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:49.870
And what the logic is supposed
to be is, cut it down to two.

00:47:49.870 --> 00:47:51.880
Your chances are better
if you have to guess.

00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:55.061
Talk to your wise expert, who's
sitting by on the phone there.

00:47:55.061 --> 00:47:57.560
And they're going to be wise
and be able to hopefully answer

00:47:57.560 --> 00:47:58.160
this question.

00:47:58.160 --> 00:48:00.840
Or ask a whole bunch of people.

00:48:00.840 --> 00:48:02.150
And they would all vote.

00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:04.900
And any smart
contestant would choose

00:48:04.900 --> 00:48:06.770
whatever the audience chose.

00:48:06.770 --> 00:48:11.840
Because, when the audience
was asked, 91% of the time

00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:13.740
they got the right answer.

00:48:13.740 --> 00:48:17.190
They got the majority of people
voting for the right answer.

00:48:17.190 --> 00:48:20.030
And this is more
wisdom of the crowd.

00:48:20.030 --> 00:48:22.430
And this was a much
better hit rate

00:48:22.430 --> 00:48:25.420
than whoever the expert was on
the other side of the phone.

00:48:25.420 --> 00:48:28.250
One person could be
extremely expert,

00:48:28.250 --> 00:48:30.200
but they're not
going to be as expert

00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:35.250
as a whole bunch of somewhat
decent experts thrown together.

00:48:35.250 --> 00:48:38.610
This is the notion behind a
field called prediction markets

00:48:38.610 --> 00:48:43.340
where what you do is you are
trying to predict some event.

00:48:43.340 --> 00:48:45.220
For example, the
Pentagon is very

00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:47.250
interested in using
prediction markets

00:48:47.250 --> 00:48:51.440
to try to predict where the
next terrorist attack might be.

00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:54.130
And what you do is you get
a whole bunch of experts,

00:48:54.130 --> 00:48:56.130
and you ask each of them
to think about whatever

00:48:56.130 --> 00:49:00.260
the parameters are and take a
guess as to how long it will

00:49:00.260 --> 00:49:02.290
be before the next one occurs.

00:49:02.290 --> 00:49:04.320
And what you do is,
you average them up

00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:06.930
and assume there is a wisdom
of the crowd thing going on.

00:49:06.930 --> 00:49:09.660
And that will give you
lots of information.

00:49:09.660 --> 00:49:11.720
Great case of this
a few years ago.

00:49:11.720 --> 00:49:14.920
There was some
submarine or something

00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:17.850
that sunk somewhere out in
the Pacific, in the ocean.

00:49:17.850 --> 00:49:20.210
And nobody knew where
it was, but they kind of

00:49:20.210 --> 00:49:22.280
knew where the last
sighting, the last recording,

00:49:22.280 --> 00:49:23.160
was from it.

00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:25.840
But they had a whole
bunch of naval experts.

00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:28.330
And they had all of
them sort of bone

00:49:28.330 --> 00:49:33.010
up on the knowledge of what was
the water temperature and wind

00:49:33.010 --> 00:49:35.650
speeds and where they
were on the last sighting

00:49:35.650 --> 00:49:37.690
and what was on TV
that day or whatever.

00:49:37.690 --> 00:49:39.660
They got all the
information, and each one

00:49:39.660 --> 00:49:42.880
made a guess as to where
it would be on the map.

00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:44.560
And you put them all together.

00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:46.620
And they had guesses
covering hundreds

00:49:46.620 --> 00:49:48.530
of square miles of ocean floor.

00:49:48.530 --> 00:49:50.680
And they put it all
together, and they came up

00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:53.850
within 300 yards of
the right location.

00:49:53.850 --> 00:49:57.990
So what we have over and over
here is this business of,

00:49:57.990 --> 00:50:02.420
put a lot of somewhat decent
experts together on a problem,

00:50:02.420 --> 00:50:05.790
and they will be more accurate
than almost any one single

00:50:05.790 --> 00:50:07.880
amazing expert at it.

00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:09.670
Under a few conditions.

00:50:09.670 --> 00:50:13.500
The collection of these partial
experts can't be biased.

00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:15.270
Or if they are,
they all have to be

00:50:15.270 --> 00:50:18.610
biased in a random
scattering of directions.

00:50:18.610 --> 00:50:20.724
And they need to really
do be somewhat expert.

00:50:20.724 --> 00:50:22.140
If you get a whole
bunch of people

00:50:22.140 --> 00:50:24.320
off the subway in
New York and ask

00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:26.416
them to guess the
weight of the oxen,

00:50:26.416 --> 00:50:28.540
they are not going to wisdom
of the crowd their way

00:50:28.540 --> 00:50:30.740
into being able to milk
the thing afterwards.

00:50:30.740 --> 00:50:34.340
You've got to have people who
have some experience with it.

00:50:34.340 --> 00:50:36.200
And you wind up seeing
wisdom of the crowd

00:50:36.200 --> 00:50:38.850
stuff going on in all
sorts of living systems.

00:50:38.850 --> 00:50:42.690
For example, here
is an ant colony.

00:50:42.690 --> 00:50:44.650
And here's a dead ant.

00:50:44.650 --> 00:50:46.560
And they're trying to
get the dead ant back

00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:47.364
to the ant colony.

00:50:47.364 --> 00:50:48.780
And when you look
at these things,

00:50:48.780 --> 00:50:51.740
they know how to get it, or
they get some dead beetle

00:50:51.740 --> 00:50:54.240
or something to eat, and
a whole bunch of ants

00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:56.350
push it over back
to their colony.

00:50:56.350 --> 00:50:56.850
Oh.

00:50:56.850 --> 00:51:00.000
Does each one of them
know exactly where

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:01.460
they should be pushing?

00:51:01.460 --> 00:51:01.990
No.

00:51:01.990 --> 00:51:04.190
What you have
instead is, each ant

00:51:04.190 --> 00:51:07.250
has somewhat of the
right idea as to where

00:51:07.250 --> 00:51:08.330
they should be going.

00:51:08.330 --> 00:51:11.660
And there are more ants that
have a reasonably accurate

00:51:11.660 --> 00:51:14.100
notion, a smaller number
that are somewhat off,

00:51:14.100 --> 00:51:16.990
and a really small number
that are way out of whack

00:51:16.990 --> 00:51:19.390
because in general ants
are kind of experts

00:51:19.390 --> 00:51:20.640
at finding ant colonies.

00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:21.847
They're pretty informed.

00:51:21.847 --> 00:51:23.680
And what you do is you
put them all together

00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:26.270
and you do this
vector geometry stuff.

00:51:26.270 --> 00:51:29.420
And it moves perfectly
in that direction.

00:51:29.420 --> 00:51:33.290
And no single ant knows
exactly where the colony is.

00:51:33.290 --> 00:51:36.870
You've got a wisdom of the
crowd thing here going on.

00:51:36.870 --> 00:51:38.562
OK.

00:51:38.562 --> 00:51:40.370
Where are we?

00:51:40.370 --> 00:51:41.120
Five-minute break.

00:51:44.352 --> 00:51:46.560
If you have a chance, could
you email me that website

00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:48.570
so we could post it
in the CourseWorks?

00:51:48.570 --> 00:51:49.650
That's great.

00:51:49.650 --> 00:51:52.000
OK, picking up.

00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:54.810
So now we are ready to
take some of those building

00:51:54.810 --> 00:51:59.180
blocks, wisdom of the crowd
stuff, biophysical potato

00:51:59.180 --> 00:52:01.720
chips, and begin to
see it more formally

00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:04.480
in this field of
emergent complexity.

00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:05.990
What is that about?

00:52:05.990 --> 00:52:07.620
What we've already alluded to.

00:52:07.620 --> 00:52:14.110
It's systems where you have
a very small number of rules

00:52:14.110 --> 00:52:19.670
for how very large numbers of
simple participants interact.

00:52:19.670 --> 00:52:20.850
What's that about?

00:52:20.850 --> 00:52:22.670
Here's what emergence is about.

00:52:22.670 --> 00:52:25.270
You take an ant and you
put it on a table top

00:52:25.270 --> 00:52:26.770
and you watch what
it's doing and it

00:52:26.770 --> 00:52:28.490
makes no sense whatsoever.

00:52:28.490 --> 00:52:31.700
You take 10 ants and do it and
none of them make any sense.

00:52:31.700 --> 00:52:33.880
You put 100 and they're
all scattering around.

00:52:33.880 --> 00:52:37.580
And somewhere around, I don't
know, 1,000 ants or so, they

00:52:37.580 --> 00:52:39.900
suddenly start making sense.

00:52:39.900 --> 00:52:43.030
And you put in 10,000 or
100,000 or whatever it is,

00:52:43.030 --> 00:52:46.210
and suddenly, instead of some
little thing wandering around

00:52:46.210 --> 00:52:48.950
aimlessly, you
suddenly have a colony

00:52:48.950 --> 00:52:55.370
that can grow fungi and regulate
the temperature of the colony

00:52:55.370 --> 00:52:56.590
and all these things.

00:52:56.590 --> 00:53:00.220
And suddenly, out of
these ants emerges

00:53:00.220 --> 00:53:04.920
an incredibly complex, adapted
system, an adaptive one.

00:53:04.920 --> 00:53:08.110
And the critical point
there is, no single ant

00:53:08.110 --> 00:53:10.770
knows what the temperature
should be in the colony.

00:53:10.770 --> 00:53:12.800
Or if this is time
to go out foraging

00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:14.970
in this direction instead
of that direction.

00:53:14.970 --> 00:53:20.070
It all emerges out of the
nature of ant interactions.

00:53:20.070 --> 00:53:24.210
You've got very simple
constituent parts.

00:53:24.210 --> 00:53:27.090
An ant, much like
one box that's filled

00:53:27.090 --> 00:53:29.370
in the cellular automata.

00:53:29.370 --> 00:53:32.490
You've got very
simple rules for how

00:53:32.490 --> 00:53:34.110
they interact with each other.

00:53:34.110 --> 00:53:36.407
Ants have, I don't know,
maybe 3 and 1/2 rules.

00:53:36.407 --> 00:53:38.490
Don't tell Deborah Gordon
in the department, who's

00:53:38.490 --> 00:53:39.790
an ant obsessive.

00:53:39.790 --> 00:53:42.150
But that I may be
inadvertently dissing the ants.

00:53:42.150 --> 00:53:45.740
But they have a small number of
rules as to how they interact.

00:53:45.740 --> 00:53:48.241
If you bump into an ant and you
do this with the pheromones,

00:53:48.241 --> 00:53:49.906
you go this way, and
if you go that way.

00:53:49.906 --> 00:53:51.000
And I'm just making it up.

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:52.550
They have a small
number of rules.

00:53:52.550 --> 00:53:56.900
And as long as you've got a lot
of ants doing this, out of this

00:53:56.900 --> 00:54:01.300
can emerge hugely complex
adaptive patterns.

00:54:01.300 --> 00:54:04.730
And this is what an
emergent system is about.

00:54:04.730 --> 00:54:07.020
Simple players, huge
numbers of them,

00:54:07.020 --> 00:54:10.090
simple nearest neighbor rules.

00:54:10.090 --> 00:54:13.000
And you throw them all together,
and out comes patterning.

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:17.000
And there is no single ant that
knows what the blueprint is,

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:18.990
and there's no blueprint.

00:54:18.990 --> 00:54:21.610
There is no plan
anywhere that says

00:54:21.610 --> 00:54:25.260
what the mature form of the
colony should look like.

00:54:25.260 --> 00:54:27.260
There are no instructions.

00:54:27.260 --> 00:54:31.340
It is bottom-up organization
rather than top down.

00:54:31.340 --> 00:54:34.170
And you see all sorts
of versions, then,

00:54:34.170 --> 00:54:39.540
of emergent complexity
built around, again,

00:54:39.540 --> 00:54:43.290
lots of elements of things
with a small number of very

00:54:43.290 --> 00:54:48.520
simple rules about how neighbors
interact with each other.

00:54:48.520 --> 00:54:49.680
We need that board.

00:54:49.680 --> 00:54:52.220
OK.

00:54:52.220 --> 00:54:56.050
Here we have two, four,
six, eight different cities

00:54:56.050 --> 00:54:59.660
or eight different
places where ant

00:54:59.660 --> 00:55:01.650
can find good food or
eight different something

00:55:01.650 --> 00:55:03.810
or others, eight
different locales.

00:55:03.810 --> 00:55:05.900
And you were trying to
do something efficient.

00:55:05.900 --> 00:55:09.440
You need to go to each one
of them to sell your product

00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:11.760
or to see if there's
good food there or not.

00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:13.260
You need to go to
all eight of them,

00:55:13.260 --> 00:55:16.140
and you want to do it as
efficiently as possible.

00:55:16.140 --> 00:55:20.100
You want to find the way to
have the shortest possible path

00:55:20.100 --> 00:55:21.750
to go to all of these places.

00:55:21.750 --> 00:55:26.260
And this is the classic
traveling salesman problem.

00:55:26.260 --> 00:55:28.550
And nobody at this
point can solve it.

00:55:28.550 --> 00:55:30.980
There's no formal
mathematical solution.

00:55:30.980 --> 00:55:33.330
And by the time you get
to, like, eight locales,

00:55:33.330 --> 00:55:36.180
there's, like, hundreds of
billions of different ways

00:55:36.180 --> 00:55:37.300
you can do it.

00:55:37.300 --> 00:55:40.310
So how can-- you can't come
up with the perfect solution.

00:55:40.310 --> 00:55:44.000
But you could come up with maybe
kind of a good, decent one.

00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:45.560
There's two ways
you could do it.

00:55:45.560 --> 00:55:49.840
First is to have an unbelievably
good computer that just,

00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:54.640
by sheer force, cranks out a
bazillion different outcomes

00:55:54.640 --> 00:55:57.700
and in each case measures
how much you're doing it.

00:55:57.700 --> 00:56:01.230
And you can get something
close to an optimal answer.

00:56:01.230 --> 00:56:04.200
The other way of doing
it is to have yourself

00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:07.280
some virtual ants in
something that is now

00:56:07.280 --> 00:56:09.810
called swarm intelligence.

00:56:09.810 --> 00:56:11.150
Here's what you do.

00:56:11.150 --> 00:56:14.100
You need to have two
generations of ants.

00:56:14.100 --> 00:56:16.395
The first generation,
you stick them all down,

00:56:16.395 --> 00:56:18.020
different numbers of
them, and they all

00:56:18.020 --> 00:56:19.520
start off in these
different cities,

00:56:19.520 --> 00:56:20.800
these different locales.

00:56:20.800 --> 00:56:25.810
And their rule is, each one
of them goes to another city.

00:56:25.810 --> 00:56:28.630
Each one of them goes
to another destination.

00:56:28.630 --> 00:56:30.670
But here's the follow-me rule.

00:56:30.670 --> 00:56:34.130
The ants are leaving a pheromone
trail, pheromone trail,

00:56:34.130 --> 00:56:35.960
and they stick
their rear end down.

00:56:35.960 --> 00:56:36.460
What is it?

00:56:36.460 --> 00:56:37.690
Head, thorax, abdomen.

00:56:37.690 --> 00:56:39.280
And they stick
their abdomen down.

00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:41.130
And they've got a
gland at the bottom

00:56:41.130 --> 00:56:43.300
there, which
releases a pheromone

00:56:43.300 --> 00:56:46.710
and makes a track, a scent
track, of the pheromone there.

00:56:46.710 --> 00:56:50.410
And a very simple rule,
they have a finite amount

00:56:50.410 --> 00:56:55.290
of pheromone in there to expend
on the entire path they're

00:56:55.290 --> 00:56:57.170
making.

00:56:57.170 --> 00:57:00.290
In other words, the
shorter the path,

00:57:00.290 --> 00:57:03.040
the thicker the pheromone
trail is going to be.

00:57:05.940 --> 00:57:08.570
Now what you do is
deal with the fact

00:57:08.570 --> 00:57:11.850
that the pheromones
dissipate after a while.

00:57:11.850 --> 00:57:13.410
They evaporate.

00:57:13.410 --> 00:57:16.690
And thus, the thicker
the path, the longer

00:57:16.690 --> 00:57:19.480
it's going to be there.

00:57:19.480 --> 00:57:22.640
You now take a second
generation of virtual ants,

00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:24.230
and you throw them in there.

00:57:24.230 --> 00:57:27.760
And what their rule is,
they wander around randomly.

00:57:27.760 --> 00:57:30.690
And any time they hit
a pheromone trail,

00:57:30.690 --> 00:57:33.850
they join the trail
one way or the other,

00:57:33.850 --> 00:57:36.510
and they lay down a
pheromone trail of their own

00:57:36.510 --> 00:57:37.350
with their abdomen.

00:57:37.350 --> 00:57:40.640
They reinforce the
markings on this trail.

00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:43.770
And let 10,000
virtual ants do that

00:57:43.770 --> 00:57:47.340
for a couple of hundred
thousand rounds of generations,

00:57:47.340 --> 00:57:50.950
and they solve the traveling
salesman problem for you.

00:57:50.950 --> 00:57:54.040
Because it winds up
being, the short paths,

00:57:54.040 --> 00:57:57.850
the more efficient ways
of connecting locales,

00:57:57.850 --> 00:58:00.870
will leave larger,
thicker trails,

00:58:00.870 --> 00:58:04.110
which are more likely to
last longer and thus increase

00:58:04.110 --> 00:58:07.060
the odds that an ant
wandering around randomly

00:58:07.060 --> 00:58:09.680
will bump into it
and reinforce it.

00:58:09.680 --> 00:58:12.040
And what you see
is, initially, there

00:58:12.040 --> 00:58:13.980
will be every possible path.

00:58:13.980 --> 00:58:16.110
And as you run
this over and over,

00:58:16.110 --> 00:58:18.480
it will begin to fade
out, and out will

00:58:18.480 --> 00:58:20.670
emerge the more efficient ones.

00:58:20.670 --> 00:58:23.860
You can optimize the
outcome doing it this way,

00:58:23.860 --> 00:58:26.810
just asking virtual
ants to do it for you.

00:58:26.810 --> 00:58:30.100
And this is exactly how ants
do it out in the real world.

00:58:30.100 --> 00:58:31.870
When they're foraging
in different places,

00:58:31.870 --> 00:58:34.330
there is a first wave
of them that comes out,

00:58:34.330 --> 00:58:37.690
and they go to locales
leaving scent trails.

00:58:37.690 --> 00:58:39.840
And then there are the
wanderers that come in,

00:58:39.840 --> 00:58:42.260
and when they hit a
trail they join it.

00:58:42.260 --> 00:58:46.090
There are now telecommunications
companies that use swarm

00:58:46.090 --> 00:58:49.270
intelligence to figure out
what's the shortest length

00:58:49.270 --> 00:58:53.340
of cable they need to use to
connect up eight different

00:58:53.340 --> 00:58:56.950
states' worth of
telecommunication towers,

00:58:56.950 --> 00:58:58.150
whatever they're called.

00:58:58.150 --> 00:58:59.722
And they can sit
there and do math

00:58:59.722 --> 00:59:01.180
till the end of
the universe trying

00:59:01.180 --> 00:59:04.130
to figure out the cheapest
way to wire them up.

00:59:04.130 --> 00:59:07.540
Or they can use
swarm intelligence.

00:59:07.540 --> 00:59:09.990
And that's what a lot of
them do at this point.

00:59:09.990 --> 00:59:11.550
It works.

00:59:11.550 --> 00:59:12.920
What are the features of it?

00:59:12.920 --> 00:59:15.080
This is not wisdom of the crowd.

00:59:15.080 --> 00:59:19.140
This is not that every ant knows
a solution to the traveling

00:59:19.140 --> 00:59:22.040
salesman problem, except none of
them have the perfect solution.

00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:23.665
But put them all
together, and they all

00:59:23.665 --> 00:59:24.720
get to vote on outcomes.

00:59:24.720 --> 00:59:27.940
The ant don't know from
traveling salesman problems.

00:59:27.940 --> 00:59:30.940
The ant knows nothing about
trying to optimize this.

00:59:30.940 --> 00:59:34.170
All the ant knows is one
of two different rules.

00:59:34.170 --> 00:59:36.570
If I'm walking from one
of these to one of these,

00:59:36.570 --> 00:59:39.700
the longer I walk, the
thinner the pheromone trail.

00:59:39.700 --> 00:59:43.680
Or rule number two, if I
stumble into one of these,

00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:46.380
I join it and put down
my markings there.

00:59:46.380 --> 00:59:50.400
Two simple rules,
one very simple type

00:59:50.400 --> 00:59:54.320
of sort of unit of
information in there, an ant.

00:59:54.320 --> 00:59:57.590
And all you need to do is make
sure there's enough of them,

00:59:57.590 --> 01:00:00.680
and they solve the
problem for you.

01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:02.960
This winds up explaining
another thing.

01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:06.400
How do bees pick a
new nesting site?

01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:10.117
A bee's nest, a bee's--
hornet's nest, a bee's nest.

01:00:10.117 --> 01:00:12.200
Every now and then the
bees need to leave and pick

01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:13.210
a new place to live.

01:00:13.210 --> 01:00:15.520
And how do they figure
out the good place?

01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:18.420
And there's all sorts of
criteria of nutrients.

01:00:18.420 --> 01:00:21.650
And so all sorts of bees go
out there, and what they do

01:00:21.650 --> 01:00:23.490
is they look for food sources.

01:00:23.490 --> 01:00:25.940
And they look for a place
that will have a lot of food.

01:00:25.940 --> 01:00:29.370
Maybe that's a place to
go and move the colony.

01:00:29.370 --> 01:00:32.360
So we know already, the bee will
go out and find its food there,

01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:33.240
its food source.

01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:34.450
It will come back in.

01:00:34.450 --> 01:00:37.200
And here's the colony
cut in cross-section.

01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:40.250
And what you wind up having
is this ring of bees.

01:00:40.250 --> 01:00:41.380
Here is the entry.

01:00:41.380 --> 01:00:43.509
And you have the
bee dancing going on

01:00:43.509 --> 01:00:45.800
that we've heard about in
the middle of the dance floor

01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:46.320
there.

01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:49.830
And we've already heard it's
this pattern of this figure

01:00:49.830 --> 01:00:51.440
eight while shaking
the rear end.

01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:53.365
And we know what
the information is,

01:00:53.365 --> 01:00:59.300
which is the angle tells the
direction to go out there.

01:00:59.300 --> 01:01:01.960
And the extent to
which it's wiggling

01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:05.270
its rear end is how long
you're supposed to fly for.

01:01:05.270 --> 01:01:09.230
But the final variable is,
the better the resource,

01:01:09.230 --> 01:01:13.250
the longer you do the dance.

01:01:13.250 --> 01:01:15.820
So you've got bees coming in
from all over the place that

01:01:15.820 --> 01:01:17.320
have found good
resources, that have

01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:19.090
found so-so ones, all of that.

01:01:19.090 --> 01:01:21.820
And so there's bees doing
all this dancing stuff here

01:01:21.820 --> 01:01:23.590
of different durations.

01:01:23.590 --> 01:01:26.920
And the ones who have
found the good solution

01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:30.890
to where do we want to
live are dancing longer.

01:01:30.890 --> 01:01:33.450
The ones who have found
the most efficient path

01:01:33.450 --> 01:01:36.540
are leaving a message longer.

01:01:36.540 --> 01:01:39.080
So now you bring in
your second generation.

01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:41.780
And the rule is
among bees, if they

01:01:41.780 --> 01:01:45.160
happen to bump into a bee
that is doing a dance,

01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:47.890
the bee responds and goes
where it tells you to go.

01:01:47.890 --> 01:01:51.420
So a bee may randomly sort of
bump into one of these guys

01:01:51.420 --> 01:01:52.540
and then off it goes.

01:01:52.540 --> 01:01:54.790
Actually, I'm sure it's
more complicated than this,

01:01:54.790 --> 01:01:56.860
but it's along the
lines of there's now

01:01:56.860 --> 01:01:59.010
random interactions.

01:01:59.010 --> 01:02:04.300
If one of the peripheral
bees encounters, bumps into,

01:02:04.300 --> 01:02:06.370
one of these bees
that has information,

01:02:06.370 --> 01:02:09.570
it joins in in that bee's group.

01:02:09.570 --> 01:02:12.220
And it then goes and
finds the food resource

01:02:12.220 --> 01:02:14.210
and comes back with
the information.

01:02:14.210 --> 01:02:19.560
So thus, by definition, if you
have found a great food source,

01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:21.940
you're going to
be dancing longer,

01:02:21.940 --> 01:02:25.280
which increases the odds of
other bees randomly bumping

01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:29.090
into you, which causes them to
go and find the same great food

01:02:29.090 --> 01:02:31.780
source and come back
and dance longer.

01:02:31.780 --> 01:02:34.220
And the ones with lousy ones
are coming in and dancing

01:02:34.220 --> 01:02:36.510
very briefly, and thus
there is hardly any odds

01:02:36.510 --> 01:02:37.980
of somebody bumping into them.

01:02:37.980 --> 01:02:41.090
And what you begin to
do is, you suddenly

01:02:41.090 --> 01:02:43.540
optimize where the
hive is supposed to go.

01:02:43.540 --> 01:02:45.660
Again, it's not
wisdom of the crowd.

01:02:45.660 --> 01:02:50.340
It is an emergent feature of
one generation with information

01:02:50.340 --> 01:02:53.530
based on some very simple
rules, and one information

01:02:53.530 --> 01:02:55.880
that generates
some random element

01:02:55.880 --> 01:03:00.020
and out comes an ideal solution.

01:03:00.020 --> 01:03:01.900
More versions of this.

01:03:01.900 --> 01:03:05.410
Another domain where some
very simple rules out of it

01:03:05.410 --> 01:03:08.400
emerges something very
complex and adaptive.

01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:11.160
OK, so the themes here
are two generations,

01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:13.781
the more adaptive the
signal, the stronger it is

01:03:13.781 --> 01:03:14.780
and the longer it lasts.

01:03:14.780 --> 01:03:16.700
And then the
randomization element.

01:03:16.700 --> 01:03:19.780
Another theme that comes through
in a lot of emergence, which

01:03:19.780 --> 01:03:23.730
is to have your elements
in there, your ants,

01:03:23.730 --> 01:03:25.610
your bees, your
traveling salesmen,

01:03:25.610 --> 01:03:27.290
whatever the constituents are.

01:03:27.290 --> 01:03:30.470
And now what the rules
are are simple rules

01:03:30.470 --> 01:03:33.650
of attraction and repulsion.

01:03:33.650 --> 01:03:36.120
Which is to say,
some of the elements

01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:39.020
are attracted to each other,
and some of the elements

01:03:39.020 --> 01:03:40.920
are repulsed by each other.

01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:43.460
Some are pulled together,
some are pushed apart

01:03:43.460 --> 01:03:46.520
like, for example, magnets.

01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:49.080
Magnets are polarized
in the sense

01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:51.840
that magnets only have
two ways of interacting

01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:54.940
with each other, simple
nearest neighbor rules.

01:03:54.940 --> 01:03:57.050
They're either
attracting or repelling,

01:03:57.050 --> 01:03:59.480
depending on the orientation.

01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:01.130
So here's what you do now.

01:04:01.130 --> 01:04:03.910
You take a system and
something very simple.

01:04:03.910 --> 01:04:08.470
You've got some simulated
SimCity sort of thing

01:04:08.470 --> 01:04:12.240
where you're letting the
system run to design a city.

01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:15.130
You want to do your urban
planning in your city

01:04:15.130 --> 01:04:16.800
that you're going
to construct there.

01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:19.080
And what you do is,
you can sit there

01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:24.980
and you can study millions of
laws about zoning and economics

01:04:24.980 --> 01:04:27.870
and all of that to decide
something very simple.

01:04:27.870 --> 01:04:30.800
Where are you going to put
the commercial districts?

01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:34.060
And where are the residential
districts going to be?

01:04:34.060 --> 01:04:37.920
Or you can have just a small
number of simple rules.

01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:41.230
Which is, for example,
if a market appears

01:04:41.230 --> 01:04:46.200
in some place, what it
attracts is a Starbucks.

01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:50.380
And what it also attracts
is a clothing store

01:04:50.380 --> 01:04:51.520
or some such thing.

01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:52.890
So a bunch of rules.

01:04:52.890 --> 01:04:54.500
But then you have
repulsion rules,

01:04:54.500 --> 01:04:56.770
which is, if you
have a Starbucks,

01:04:56.770 --> 01:04:59.180
it will repulse any
other Starbucks.

01:04:59.180 --> 01:05:02.030
So the nearest other Starbucks
can be this far away.

01:05:02.030 --> 01:05:03.970
If you have a
competitor's market,

01:05:03.970 --> 01:05:05.980
it can't get any
closer than this.

01:05:05.980 --> 01:05:08.980
That sort of thing, these simple
attraction/repulsion rules.

01:05:08.980 --> 01:05:10.750
And what you wind
up getting when

01:05:10.750 --> 01:05:19.050
you run these simulations are
commercial districts in a city

01:05:19.050 --> 01:05:24.000
where you get clusters of
commercial sort of places that

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.290
are balanced by
attraction and repulsion

01:05:26.290 --> 01:05:29.310
where you have thoroughfares
connecting them.

01:05:29.310 --> 01:05:33.320
And the more elements there
are in the two neighborhood

01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:36.920
commercial centers, the bigger
the connection is going to be,

01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:40.820
the bigger the street is, the
more lanes, the more powerful

01:05:40.820 --> 01:05:42.470
the signal coming through there.

01:05:42.470 --> 01:05:43.640
And you throw it in.

01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:46.350
And out pops an
urban plan that looks

01:05:46.350 --> 01:05:48.750
exactly like the sort
of ones that the best

01:05:48.750 --> 01:05:50.510
urban planners come up with.

01:05:50.510 --> 01:05:53.800
And all you need to do instead
is run these simulations

01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:57.490
with some very simple
attraction and repulsion rules.

01:05:57.490 --> 01:06:00.100
So you do that, and it winds
up producing stuff that looks

01:06:00.100 --> 01:06:01.520
like cities.

01:06:01.520 --> 01:06:04.360
You do that with a
bunch of neurons.

01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:07.100
You take a Petri dish, and
you throw in a whole bunch

01:06:07.100 --> 01:06:08.480
of individual neurons.

01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:10.890
And they have very simple rules.

01:06:10.890 --> 01:06:15.060
They secrete factors which
attract some types of neurons.

01:06:15.060 --> 01:06:19.040
And they secrete factors which
repel other types of neurons.

01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:22.230
And all of them are having
some very simple rules.

01:06:22.230 --> 01:06:25.080
When I encounter this,
I grow projections

01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:26.860
towards where it's coming from.

01:06:26.860 --> 01:06:29.450
If I encounter that,
I grow projections

01:06:29.450 --> 01:06:30.640
in the opposite direction.

01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:32.950
Simple attraction and repulsion.

01:06:32.950 --> 01:06:35.280
And what you do
is, at this point,

01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:38.200
you throw in a whole bunch
of neurons, each one where

01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:39.630
you throw into a Petri dish.

01:06:39.630 --> 01:06:42.530
And at the beginning they're
all scattered evenly all

01:06:42.530 --> 01:06:43.340
over the place.

01:06:43.340 --> 01:06:46.060
And you come back, and you
come back two days later,

01:06:46.060 --> 01:06:49.220
and it looks just like this.

01:06:49.220 --> 01:06:52.580
You have clusters of
neurons sending projections,

01:06:52.580 --> 01:06:55.380
and you have all these empty
residential areas in between.

01:06:55.380 --> 01:06:58.620
And if you just mark this
in a schematic way, looking

01:06:58.620 --> 01:07:00.850
from above you're not
going to be able to tell,

01:07:00.850 --> 01:07:03.330
is this the commercial
districts in a big city?

01:07:03.330 --> 01:07:05.990
Or are these neurons
growing in a dish?

01:07:05.990 --> 01:07:10.210
And you get areas of nuclei
of cell bodies and areas

01:07:10.210 --> 01:07:14.220
of projections, and it winds
up looking exactly like that.

01:07:14.220 --> 01:07:18.950
And amazingly, there was a paper
in Science earlier this year.

01:07:18.950 --> 01:07:21.170
And it was looking at
one of these versions,

01:07:21.170 --> 01:07:23.550
again, in this case
attraction and repulsion

01:07:23.550 --> 01:07:26.410
rules with ants' colonies
setting up foraging paths.

01:07:26.410 --> 01:07:29.330
And they explicitly
compared one colony

01:07:29.330 --> 01:07:32.340
to the efficiency of the
distribution of the train

01:07:32.340 --> 01:07:35.040
stations in the
Tokyo subway system.

01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:38.190
And what they showed was
very similar solutions,

01:07:38.190 --> 01:07:40.920
but the ants had gotten
a more optimal one.

01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:44.810
And the subway system had
people sitting there salaried

01:07:44.810 --> 01:07:46.750
to figure out the
best way to do it.

01:07:46.750 --> 01:07:49.355
All the ants had were
very simple rules

01:07:49.355 --> 01:07:52.710
of, if it's someone from the
other colony I stay this way,

01:07:52.710 --> 01:07:54.880
if it's someone from
mine, simple attraction

01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:55.700
and repulsion.

01:07:55.700 --> 01:07:59.330
And out comes something that
looks like this as well.

01:07:59.330 --> 01:08:03.390
So here you see that happening
with a remarkably small number

01:08:03.390 --> 01:08:04.990
of rules.

01:08:04.990 --> 01:08:08.670
Now you put it into a really
interesting context, which

01:08:08.670 --> 01:08:12.600
is something we bumped into back
when first introducing proteins

01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:16.000
and DNA sequence equals shape
equals function, all of that.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.086
Molecules have charges on them.

01:08:18.086 --> 01:08:20.169
Some of them were positively
charged, some of them

01:08:20.169 --> 01:08:21.200
were negatively.

01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:22.140
Whoa.

01:08:22.140 --> 01:08:24.569
Attraction and repulsion.

01:08:24.569 --> 01:08:26.979
Positively charged
molecules are attracted

01:08:26.979 --> 01:08:28.510
to negatively charged ones.

01:08:28.510 --> 01:08:30.250
Same charged ones repulse.

01:08:30.250 --> 01:08:34.100
Here we have a system with very
simple attraction and repulsion

01:08:34.100 --> 01:08:35.550
rules.

01:08:35.550 --> 01:08:38.740
And that's the logic behind,
when one thinks about it,

01:08:38.740 --> 01:08:42.069
one of the all-time important
experiments, something

01:08:42.069 --> 01:08:45.510
that was done in the 1950s by a
pair of scientists, University

01:08:45.510 --> 01:08:47.750
of Chicago, Urey and Miller.

01:08:47.750 --> 01:08:48.990
Here's what they did.

01:08:48.990 --> 01:08:52.750
They took, like, big
vats of organic soup

01:08:52.750 --> 01:08:57.800
stuff that just had all sorts
of simple molecules in there.

01:08:57.800 --> 01:09:00.939
Little fragments of carbon,
carbon, little fragments

01:09:00.939 --> 01:09:04.370
of-- all sorts of inorganic
molecules in there,

01:09:04.370 --> 01:09:08.550
little ones in there, floating
around in this organic soup.

01:09:08.550 --> 01:09:12.149
And what they did was they would
pass electricity through it.

01:09:12.149 --> 01:09:15.600
And they did this
vast numbers of times.

01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:18.279
And eventually
what they saw was,

01:09:18.279 --> 01:09:22.490
they would come back and check,
and these random distribution

01:09:22.490 --> 01:09:25.420
of these things, of
these little fragments,

01:09:25.420 --> 01:09:29.410
had begun to form amino acids.

01:09:29.410 --> 01:09:30.740
Whoa.

01:09:30.740 --> 01:09:32.149
Metaphor.

01:09:32.149 --> 01:09:36.410
The organic soup, just the
evenly distributed sort

01:09:36.410 --> 01:09:40.370
of world of potentially
organic molecules

01:09:40.370 --> 01:09:44.020
in a world in which electricity
passes through, lightning.

01:09:44.020 --> 01:09:46.160
What had these guys
just come up with?

01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:49.603
Some in your, like,
kitchen sink experiment

01:09:49.603 --> 01:09:52.979
of the origins of life.

01:09:52.979 --> 01:09:55.560
And what people have done
subsequently is show,

01:09:55.560 --> 01:09:57.320
you don't need the catalyst.

01:09:57.320 --> 01:09:59.640
There's a whole
world of researchers

01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:01.040
who study origin of life.

01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:06.040
And the basic notion is, you
put in enough simple molecules

01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:08.980
in there that have attraction
and repulsion rules,

01:10:08.980 --> 01:10:11.870
and you get perturbations
and spatial distributions

01:10:11.870 --> 01:10:14.300
of certain ways,
and they will begin

01:10:14.300 --> 01:10:18.809
to form rational
structures after a while.

01:10:18.809 --> 01:10:20.100
Here's another version of this.

01:10:20.100 --> 01:10:22.183
And I used to do this in
class, except I can never

01:10:22.183 --> 01:10:26.030
pull this one off, and
it just became chaotic.

01:10:26.030 --> 01:10:29.250
Kid's toy, you've
got these magnets.

01:10:29.250 --> 01:10:32.440
You either have-- you
have magnets like that.

01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:34.180
And then you have
little metal balls that

01:10:34.180 --> 01:10:36.070
can go onto the magnet here.

01:10:36.070 --> 01:10:38.170
And you've got vast
numbers of them.

01:10:38.170 --> 01:10:40.490
And you can piece them together.

01:10:40.490 --> 01:10:40.990
Whoa.

01:10:40.990 --> 01:10:43.350
This is starting to look
kind of familiar here.

01:10:43.350 --> 01:10:46.720
So we have these constituents
with very simple rules, which

01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:48.860
is the magnets repel each other.

01:10:48.860 --> 01:10:49.800
They bind.

01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:50.412
These things.

01:10:50.412 --> 01:10:51.620
And here's what you would do.

01:10:51.620 --> 01:10:52.760
Here's what I would
attempt to do.

01:10:52.760 --> 01:10:54.610
First off, I would get
somebody to show me

01:10:54.610 --> 01:10:57.600
how to get the video thing
on here to project it.

01:10:57.600 --> 01:11:01.010
But you would put up a whole
bunch of these magnets in rows,

01:11:01.010 --> 01:11:04.300
not too close to each
other, nice and symmetrical.

01:11:04.300 --> 01:11:07.460
And what you do then is you take
a handful of the metal balls

01:11:07.460 --> 01:11:09.150
and fling them in there.

01:11:09.150 --> 01:11:11.530
And if you do that
400 or 500 times,

01:11:11.530 --> 01:11:13.620
eventually they
will bounce around.

01:11:13.620 --> 01:11:15.960
And amid all the
pieces flying, you're

01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:20.970
going to get a pyramidal
structure like this.

01:11:20.970 --> 01:11:24.090
One of those just like that,
it's three dimensional,

01:11:24.090 --> 01:11:24.920
you know that.

01:11:24.920 --> 01:11:27.880
You are going to get one of
those that will simply pop out

01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:32.280
of this because that's the
nature of potato chips solving

01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:34.510
their math problem
with double saddles.

01:11:34.510 --> 01:11:37.610
That's the nature of throwing
a whole bunch of elements

01:11:37.610 --> 01:11:40.060
with simple attraction
and repulsion rules.

01:11:40.060 --> 01:11:43.980
And given enough chances, throw
in enough perturbations there,

01:11:43.980 --> 01:11:47.010
and structures will
begin to emerge.

01:11:47.010 --> 01:11:50.090
And it's the same
exact principle there,

01:11:50.090 --> 01:11:52.560
these same ones over and over.

01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:54.530
So we've got some very
simple versions where

01:11:54.530 --> 01:11:56.250
you get emergent complexity.

01:11:56.250 --> 01:11:59.120
One is this version
of a first generation

01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:01.560
has directed searches
and the intensity

01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:03.430
of the signal that
it leaves afterward

01:12:03.430 --> 01:12:05.070
is a function of
how good of a search

01:12:05.070 --> 01:12:06.990
they've done, random wanderers.

01:12:06.990 --> 01:12:09.650
Then you have the
attraction/repulsion world

01:12:09.650 --> 01:12:11.940
of putting these together,
lots of elements.

01:12:11.940 --> 01:12:14.890
And you begin to get
structures out of it.

01:12:14.890 --> 01:12:17.180
Next version of
this, or next domain

01:12:17.180 --> 01:12:21.130
of where you begin to see
the fact that these rules are

01:12:21.130 --> 01:12:24.070
underlying an awful
lot of things.

01:12:24.070 --> 01:12:27.820
Suppose here you were
studying earthquakes.

01:12:27.820 --> 01:12:30.850
And apparently there's just,
like, little earthquakes going

01:12:30.850 --> 01:12:34.870
on 20 times an hour or so
all down on the Richter

01:12:34.870 --> 01:12:38.620
scale of, you know, one
quarter or who knows what.

01:12:38.620 --> 01:12:41.720
But you get enough of these,
you get a huge database,

01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:46.290
and you can begin to graph
the frequency of Richter 1.0

01:12:46.290 --> 01:12:49.090
earthquakes and how often do you
get the Richter 2.0 and Richter

01:12:49.090 --> 01:12:50.010
3.0 and all of that.

01:12:50.010 --> 01:12:52.200
And you graph it.

01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:57.500
And it's going to look
something like this,

01:12:57.500 --> 01:13:00.520
a distribution like
that, which is obviously

01:13:00.520 --> 01:13:03.240
there's a huge number of
number one categories.

01:13:03.240 --> 01:13:06.660
And it drops off until the
extremely rare at this end.

01:13:06.660 --> 01:13:09.670
There's a distribution,
which mathematically

01:13:09.670 --> 01:13:12.150
can be described, something
called a power law

01:13:12.150 --> 01:13:14.850
distribution, with a
certain angle to it.

01:13:14.850 --> 01:13:18.070
OK, so here's the
relationship between how often

01:13:18.070 --> 01:13:21.450
do you get little teensy
earthquakes and the big ones.

01:13:21.450 --> 01:13:26.630
Now instead, what you do
is something much more

01:13:26.630 --> 01:13:31.170
different from that, which
is, you look at 50,000 people,

01:13:31.170 --> 01:13:32.940
and you look at
their phone calls

01:13:32.940 --> 01:13:34.550
over the course of the year.

01:13:34.550 --> 01:13:37.390
And you keep track
of how far the phone

01:13:37.390 --> 01:13:41.250
call was, how distant the
person is that they called.

01:13:41.250 --> 01:13:44.490
And now you map the distance,
the very shortest calls,

01:13:44.490 --> 01:13:46.150
the very longest,
and the frequency.

01:13:46.150 --> 01:13:49.120
And it's the exact same curve.

01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:52.570
It's the same power
law distribution.

01:13:52.570 --> 01:13:53.670
Next version of it.

01:13:53.670 --> 01:13:56.380
This was a study that was
done, which was-- I don't quite

01:13:56.380 --> 01:13:57.580
know how these guys did it.

01:13:57.580 --> 01:13:59.920
I always get lost in
the math on these.

01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:01.860
But in this one,
what they did was

01:14:01.860 --> 01:14:04.920
they took a whole bunch
of marked dollar bills,

01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:07.570
and they started in the middle
of-- I don't know where,

01:14:07.570 --> 01:14:09.380
I think it was at
Columbia, something--

01:14:09.380 --> 01:14:11.630
and they were
somehow able to keep

01:14:11.630 --> 01:14:15.700
track of how far the bills
had traveled a week later.

01:14:15.700 --> 01:14:18.140
And asking, OK,
how many bills had

01:14:18.140 --> 01:14:20.120
traveled no more than a mile?

01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:21.890
How many five miles?

01:14:21.890 --> 01:14:24.330
And it was the exact same curve.

01:14:24.330 --> 01:14:27.010
And people now have been
showing this same power law

01:14:27.010 --> 01:14:27.889
distribution.

01:14:27.889 --> 01:14:29.930
Here are some of the things
that have been shown.

01:14:29.930 --> 01:14:32.620
The number of
links that websites

01:14:32.620 --> 01:14:34.160
have to other websites.

01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:36.480
The number that
have only one link.

01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:39.150
Power law distribution.

01:14:39.150 --> 01:14:40.230
Proteins.

01:14:40.230 --> 01:14:44.320
The number of proteins showing
certain degrees of complexity

01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:47.750
and the numbers dropping
off with the same power law.

01:14:47.750 --> 01:14:51.200
Here's one which is the
number of emails somebody

01:14:51.200 --> 01:14:52.620
sends over the
course of the year.

01:14:52.620 --> 01:14:54.369
This is the one that
was done at Columbia.

01:14:54.369 --> 01:14:56.520
They got access to
everybody's email records.

01:14:56.520 --> 01:14:58.590
I don't understand how
they could have done this.

01:14:58.590 --> 01:15:01.920
But it was a couple of million
over the course of the year.

01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:05.680
And what they showed was the
frequency, how many people

01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:08.690
were making this small of
a number of emails over--

01:15:08.690 --> 01:15:10.890
and the same power law.

01:15:10.890 --> 01:15:13.520
Then there's this
totally crazy one,

01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:17.600
which is, OK, do you guys know
the Kevin Bacon, six degrees

01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:20.000
of separation thing there?

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:20.540
OK.

01:15:20.540 --> 01:15:22.920
Someone went and did
a study about this

01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:25.340
that they got, like,
every actor that they

01:15:25.340 --> 01:15:28.930
could find who was in a
film in the last two years.

01:15:28.930 --> 01:15:31.480
And they got all of
their filmographies.

01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:34.930
And they generated their Kevin
Bacon degrees of freedom,

01:15:34.930 --> 01:15:37.854
degrees of--

01:15:37.854 --> 01:15:38.830
Separation.

01:15:38.830 --> 01:15:39.540
Sing it out.

01:15:39.540 --> 01:15:40.120
OK.

01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:42.860
And they figured it out, the
number for each individual.

01:15:42.860 --> 01:15:44.470
And then they graphed it.

01:15:44.470 --> 01:15:47.770
How many people were six
degrees of separation away,

01:15:47.770 --> 01:15:49.570
how many were five, so on.

01:15:49.570 --> 01:15:51.360
And it's the same pattern.

01:15:51.360 --> 01:15:55.150
And this one keeps popping
up, this power law business.

01:15:55.150 --> 01:15:58.960
And what you see intrinsic
in that is, it's a fractal.

01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:00.740
Because some of the
time you're talking

01:16:00.740 --> 01:16:03.441
about what's happening with
the tectonic plates on Earth,

01:16:03.441 --> 01:16:05.690
and some of the time you're
talking about phone calls,

01:16:05.690 --> 01:16:07.981
and some of the time you're
talking about how molecules

01:16:07.981 --> 01:16:09.420
interact with each other.

01:16:09.420 --> 01:16:11.680
There's something
emergent that goes

01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:14.870
on there, which is
an outcome of some

01:16:14.870 --> 01:16:18.200
of these simple
attraction/repulsion rules,

01:16:18.200 --> 01:16:21.380
an outcome of simple
pioneer generation

01:16:21.380 --> 01:16:23.030
and then random movement ones.

01:16:23.030 --> 01:16:26.386
And out come
structures like these.

01:16:26.386 --> 01:16:30.230
This winds up being applicable
in a very interesting domain

01:16:30.230 --> 01:16:33.010
biologically.

01:16:33.010 --> 01:16:36.280
OK, so now we go back to the
traveling salesman problem.

01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:39.240
And we're having now a
cellular version of it

01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:40.710
in terms of networks.

01:16:40.710 --> 01:16:44.960
You've got a whole
bunch of nodes here.

01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:48.230
And the choice that
each node has to make,

01:16:48.230 --> 01:16:50.970
in effect, is how
many connections it

01:16:50.970 --> 01:16:54.640
will make in the network
to other nodes and how far

01:16:54.640 --> 01:16:56.760
should those connections be.

01:16:56.760 --> 01:16:59.230
Should it only connect
with ones way out there?

01:16:59.230 --> 01:17:00.520
What does it want to do?

01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:01.490
That's nonsense.

01:17:01.490 --> 01:17:04.610
In terms of optimizing
a system, what

01:17:04.610 --> 01:17:08.170
do you want your distribution
of connections of nodes

01:17:08.170 --> 01:17:09.220
in a network to be?

01:17:09.220 --> 01:17:10.940
What is it you want to optimize?

01:17:10.940 --> 01:17:12.690
You want to get
a system that has

01:17:12.690 --> 01:17:17.360
very stable, solid interactions
amongst clusters of nodes

01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:19.530
but nevertheless
occasionally has

01:17:19.530 --> 01:17:22.820
the capacity to make
long-distance connections

01:17:22.820 --> 01:17:23.710
there.

01:17:23.710 --> 01:17:26.910
And what you wind up
seeing is, if you generate

01:17:26.910 --> 01:17:31.570
a power law distribution
in terms of, OK, all

01:17:31.570 --> 01:17:34.446
of my projections are going
to be within this distance

01:17:34.446 --> 01:17:37.980
and within this same
power law distribution

01:17:37.980 --> 01:17:41.600
so that the vast majority
of the nodes in the network

01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:43.590
are having very
local connections.

01:17:43.590 --> 01:17:47.630
But still there is a possibility
now and then of very long ones.

01:17:47.630 --> 01:17:51.350
You get a system that is
the most optimal for solving

01:17:51.350 --> 01:17:55.640
problems most cheaply, cheaply,
and whatever the term is there.

01:17:55.640 --> 01:17:58.510
And this solves it for you.

01:17:58.510 --> 01:18:00.810
And then you look at
brain development.

01:18:00.810 --> 01:18:03.990
So you've got neurons
forming in the cortex,

01:18:03.990 --> 01:18:07.570
in the fetal cortex,
and you've got neurons.

01:18:07.570 --> 01:18:08.980
You've got all these nodes.

01:18:08.980 --> 01:18:12.610
And they have to figure out
how to wire up with each other

01:18:12.610 --> 01:18:15.570
and how to wire up in a
way that is most efficient.

01:18:15.570 --> 01:18:17.660
What's most efficient
in order to be

01:18:17.660 --> 01:18:21.630
able to do the sorts of things
the cortex specializes in?

01:18:21.630 --> 01:18:25.770
And you now begin to look at
the distribution of projections.

01:18:25.770 --> 01:18:28.940
And it's a power
law relationship.

01:18:28.940 --> 01:18:32.000
Most neurons in the
cortex are having

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:35.380
the vast majority of their
projections very local.

01:18:35.380 --> 01:18:37.260
But then you have
ones now and then

01:18:37.260 --> 01:18:39.360
that have moderate ones,
even rarer ones, that

01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:41.150
have extremely long ones.

01:18:41.150 --> 01:18:45.220
And you look, and this is
how the cortex is wired up.

01:18:45.220 --> 01:18:47.810
It follows a power
law distribution.

01:18:47.810 --> 01:18:49.350
And what this
allows you to do is

01:18:49.350 --> 01:18:53.140
have clusters of stable,
functional interactions.

01:18:53.140 --> 01:18:56.370
But every now and then, you
can talk to somebody way

01:18:56.370 --> 01:19:00.120
over at the other end of the
cortex to see what's happening.

01:19:00.120 --> 01:19:01.460
Interesting finding.

01:19:01.460 --> 01:19:02.620
Autism.

01:19:02.620 --> 01:19:05.610
Autism, people have been looking
for what's up biologically.

01:19:05.610 --> 01:19:06.990
And the initial
assumptions would

01:19:06.990 --> 01:19:08.406
be, there's not
going to be enough

01:19:08.406 --> 01:19:10.070
neurons in some
part of the brain

01:19:10.070 --> 01:19:11.520
or maybe too many in another.

01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:13.290
What appears to
be the case so far

01:19:13.290 --> 01:19:15.560
is there's relatively
normal number

01:19:15.560 --> 01:19:17.530
of neurons in the cortex.

01:19:17.530 --> 01:19:21.210
But then some people started
studying the projection

01:19:21.210 --> 01:19:25.200
profiles of neurons in
the cortex of individuals

01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:26.630
with autism post-mortem.

01:19:26.630 --> 01:19:27.890
Very rare to get these.

01:19:27.890 --> 01:19:30.295
And you see a power
law distribution.

01:19:30.295 --> 01:19:33.040
But it's a different one.

01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:35.100
It's a steeper one.

01:19:35.100 --> 01:19:36.480
What does that mean?

01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:39.030
In the cortex of
autistic individuals,

01:19:39.030 --> 01:19:42.800
way more of the connections
are little local ones.

01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:45.640
There's far fewer of
the long-distance ones.

01:19:45.640 --> 01:19:47.150
There are way more local ones.

01:19:47.150 --> 01:19:48.770
What does that produce?

01:19:48.770 --> 01:19:52.260
Little pockets, little
modules of function

01:19:52.260 --> 01:19:55.250
that are isolated
from other ones.

01:19:55.250 --> 01:19:58.880
And that in some ways is
what's going on functionally

01:19:58.880 --> 01:20:00.080
in someone with autism.

01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:02.820
There is a lack of
integration of a whole bunch

01:20:02.820 --> 01:20:04.650
of these different
functions there.

01:20:04.650 --> 01:20:08.880
And that's what happens when you
have maybe a mutation or maybe

01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:11.660
some epigenetic something
or other prenatally that

01:20:11.660 --> 01:20:15.610
changes the shape of the
power law distribution.

01:20:15.610 --> 01:20:16.700
Interesting.

01:20:16.700 --> 01:20:19.980
There's a gender difference
in the power law distribution

01:20:19.980 --> 01:20:22.140
of wiring in the cortex.

01:20:22.140 --> 01:20:24.540
Which is, in the
typical female brain,

01:20:24.540 --> 01:20:26.940
if this is the power
law distribution.

01:20:26.940 --> 01:20:31.260
And in the male brain
it's a little steeper.

01:20:31.260 --> 01:20:34.770
Male brains are more
modular in their wiring.

01:20:34.770 --> 01:20:37.480
What's the biggest
part of the brain?

01:20:37.480 --> 01:20:39.243
OK, we're running
out of space here.

01:20:44.990 --> 01:20:45.600
There it is.

01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:47.390
There's the brain
in cross-section.

01:20:47.390 --> 01:20:50.260
And you've got cortex
here and cortex there.

01:20:50.260 --> 01:20:52.670
And famously, here's
all the cell bodies.

01:20:52.670 --> 01:20:55.840
And when projections are
going from one hemisphere

01:20:55.840 --> 01:21:00.690
to the other, it goes across
this huge bundle of axons

01:21:00.690 --> 01:21:03.180
called the corpus callosum.

01:21:03.180 --> 01:21:07.370
The corpus callosum is
thicker in women than in men,

01:21:07.370 --> 01:21:08.200
on the average.

01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:11.310
It is thicker in
females than in males

01:21:11.310 --> 01:21:13.970
because the power
law pattern is such

01:21:13.970 --> 01:21:16.840
that there are more
long-distance connections

01:21:16.840 --> 01:21:20.664
in female networks, and thus
it's a thicker corpus callosum.

01:21:20.664 --> 01:21:22.580
The same thing is playing
out with connections

01:21:22.580 --> 01:21:23.705
like this, and connections.

01:21:23.705 --> 01:21:25.690
But this is the big honker one.

01:21:25.690 --> 01:21:29.450
You get a thinner
corpus callosum in men.

01:21:29.450 --> 01:21:34.890
You get an even thinner corpus
callosum in people with autism.

01:21:34.890 --> 01:21:38.940
Again, that hyper male notion
there of Baron Cohen's.

01:21:38.940 --> 01:21:41.850
What you have here is a
perfectly normal number

01:21:41.850 --> 01:21:46.000
of neurons, probably even
perfectly normal number

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.030
of connections
between the neurons.

01:21:48.030 --> 01:21:49.790
But they're more
local, they're more

01:21:49.790 --> 01:21:53.110
isolated in the autistic cortex.

01:21:53.110 --> 01:21:55.310
There's less
integration of function.

01:21:55.310 --> 01:21:59.250
It's more isolated
islands of function there.

01:21:59.250 --> 01:21:59.960
OK.

01:21:59.960 --> 01:22:02.270
More examples of
where you can get

01:22:02.270 --> 01:22:04.120
sort of patterns coming out.

01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:09.300
Another version of it, which
is bottom-up quality control.

01:22:09.300 --> 01:22:12.950
You start a website, you
are selling some product,

01:22:12.950 --> 01:22:14.930
you are selling
books or whatever,

01:22:14.930 --> 01:22:17.730
and you're asking people
to rate the books.

01:22:17.730 --> 01:22:21.240
And you have a board of experts
that read all your books,

01:22:21.240 --> 01:22:24.030
and they're editors and they're
wise and they're learned.

01:22:24.030 --> 01:22:26.820
And they write your book
reviews and recommend

01:22:26.820 --> 01:22:28.890
which ones should be
bought and which ones not.

01:22:28.890 --> 01:22:31.290
And you get this very
successful business

01:22:31.290 --> 01:22:33.550
going so that you're selling
more and more different

01:22:33.550 --> 01:22:34.350
kinds of books.

01:22:34.350 --> 01:22:36.630
And as a result,
you need to hire

01:22:36.630 --> 01:22:38.650
more and more of these
experts to read the books

01:22:38.650 --> 01:22:40.530
and produce their ratings.

01:22:40.530 --> 01:22:43.320
And eventually that just
becomes too top heavy.

01:22:43.320 --> 01:22:44.490
And what do you do?

01:22:44.490 --> 01:22:46.700
The whole world that
we completely take for

01:22:46.700 --> 01:22:51.250
granted now, you have bottom-up,
bottom-up evaluations.

01:22:51.250 --> 01:22:53.160
Everybody rates things.

01:22:53.160 --> 01:22:57.660
And that's the world where you
punch in a book into Amazon

01:22:57.660 --> 01:23:00.210
or you look at something in
Netflix and when you return it,

01:23:00.210 --> 01:23:03.440
it will give you, people
who liked this movie tend

01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:05.240
to like these things as well.

01:23:05.240 --> 01:23:07.560
There are no critics,
professional critics,

01:23:07.560 --> 01:23:10.530
sitting there doing
top-down evaluations.

01:23:10.530 --> 01:23:13.400
This is another
realm of expressing

01:23:13.400 --> 01:23:15.660
attraction and repulsion rules.

01:23:15.660 --> 01:23:16.530
I liked this.

01:23:16.530 --> 01:23:17.880
I didn't like this.

01:23:17.880 --> 01:23:20.010
And all you need to
do, then, is throw

01:23:20.010 --> 01:23:22.880
in elements of
randomization, and you've

01:23:22.880 --> 01:23:25.650
got bottom-up quality control.

01:23:25.650 --> 01:23:28.040
And that's a completely
different way

01:23:28.040 --> 01:23:29.010
of doing these things.

01:23:29.010 --> 01:23:33.020
What's the greatest example
out there of bottom-up systems

01:23:33.020 --> 01:23:34.436
with quality control?

01:23:34.436 --> 01:23:36.160
Wikipedia.

01:23:36.160 --> 01:23:40.570
Wikipedia does not have
gray-bearded silverback elders

01:23:40.570 --> 01:23:43.350
there writing up the
Wikipedia knowledge

01:23:43.350 --> 01:23:45.580
and sending it on
down to everyone else.

01:23:45.580 --> 01:23:48.680
It is a bottom-up
self-correcting system.

01:23:48.680 --> 01:23:51.320
It is very easy to make
fun of some of the stuff

01:23:51.320 --> 01:23:53.780
that winds up in
Wikipedia, which is, like,

01:23:53.780 --> 01:23:55.460
wildly, insanely wrong.

01:23:55.460 --> 01:23:59.390
But when you get into areas
that are fairly hard nosed.

01:23:59.390 --> 01:24:01.950
Very interesting study
about five years ago

01:24:01.950 --> 01:24:05.260
that Nature commissioned, which
was getting a bunch of experts

01:24:05.260 --> 01:24:09.340
to look at Wikipedia and to look
at the Encyclopedia Britannica

01:24:09.340 --> 01:24:12.550
and look at the
hard-nosed facts in there

01:24:12.550 --> 01:24:15.160
about the physical
sciences, the life sciences.

01:24:15.160 --> 01:24:17.570
And what you got
was, Wikipedia was

01:24:17.570 --> 01:24:21.120
in hailing distance of the
Encyclopedia Britannica's

01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:22.730
level of accuracy.

01:24:22.730 --> 01:24:24.680
And that was five years ago.

01:24:24.680 --> 01:24:28.200
And it has five years of
self-organized correction

01:24:28.200 --> 01:24:29.230
since then.

01:24:29.230 --> 01:24:30.560
This is amazing.

01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:33.790
The Encyclopedia Britannica
is like written-- there's,

01:24:33.790 --> 01:24:38.730
like, 30, like, elderly, stuffed
British scholars that they,

01:24:38.730 --> 01:24:41.240
like, have locked
in a room for years

01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:42.980
who produced the encyclopedia.

01:24:42.980 --> 01:24:46.050
And these are the law
givers and the knowledge--

01:24:46.050 --> 01:24:48.120
And you just let a
whole bunch of people

01:24:48.120 --> 01:24:50.340
loose with somewhat
differing opinions

01:24:50.340 --> 01:24:55.360
about whether Madonna
was born in 1994 or 1987

01:24:55.360 --> 01:24:56.110
or whatever it is.

01:24:56.110 --> 01:24:58.110
And you throw them
all together and you

01:24:58.110 --> 01:24:59.730
do wisdom of the crowd stuff.

01:24:59.730 --> 01:25:04.320
And out comes a self-correcting,
accurate, adaptive system

01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:09.860
with no blueprint, just with
some very simple local rules.

01:25:09.860 --> 01:25:14.470
Very simple ones, which is
looking for similar patterns

01:25:14.470 --> 01:25:16.520
shared between
different individuals,

01:25:16.520 --> 01:25:17.480
and self-correcting.

01:25:17.480 --> 01:25:19.680
Where you get even
more efficient versions

01:25:19.680 --> 01:25:21.950
of that is with a
lot of websites,

01:25:21.950 --> 01:25:25.810
where not only does everybody
get to put in their opinion,

01:25:25.810 --> 01:25:28.300
but people whose
opinions are better

01:25:28.300 --> 01:25:32.590
rated have more of a voice
in evaluating somebody else.

01:25:32.590 --> 01:25:34.790
You're putting in
weighted wisdom

01:25:34.790 --> 01:25:36.800
of the crowd-type
functions in there,

01:25:36.800 --> 01:25:40.100
and out comes
incredible accuracy.

01:25:40.100 --> 01:25:40.950
These are great.

01:25:40.950 --> 01:25:44.000
There is one drawback with
those systems, though, which

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.145
is, with ones like
Netflix, where it tells you

01:25:46.145 --> 01:25:48.770
you're going to like this if you
like this, that sort of thing.

01:25:48.770 --> 01:25:51.910
It's a system that is very
biased towards conformity.

01:25:51.910 --> 01:25:56.060
It's not good at spotting
outliers and sort of taste

01:25:56.060 --> 01:25:56.700
and such.

01:25:56.700 --> 01:25:59.460
What you really want to
do in those systems is,

01:25:59.460 --> 01:26:03.200
here are the movies-- of the
movies that are out right now,

01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:06.200
here are the ones that have
10% of the people think

01:26:06.200 --> 01:26:08.080
it's the greatest
movie they've ever seen

01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:10.430
and 10% think it's
the worst movie.

01:26:10.430 --> 01:26:12.540
That's an interesting
movie to see.

01:26:12.540 --> 01:26:14.630
That's when you want
to be able to get

01:26:14.630 --> 01:26:18.830
a way of bottom-up information
about the extremes.

01:26:18.830 --> 01:26:20.930
Movies that generate
controversy.

01:26:20.930 --> 01:26:23.170
Everybody's going to
love whatever it is,

01:26:23.170 --> 01:26:24.800
and that doesn't
take a whole lot.

01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:27.480
This is a way to break the
potential for conformity

01:26:27.480 --> 01:26:29.090
in these bottom-up systems.

01:26:29.090 --> 01:26:33.100
Nonetheless, overall it
winds up solving a problem

01:26:33.100 --> 01:26:37.130
without professional
critics, without a blueprint,

01:26:37.130 --> 01:26:40.130
without top-down control.

01:26:40.130 --> 01:26:42.330
So how do you wire
some of these up?

01:26:42.330 --> 01:26:44.390
Back to the cortex.

01:26:44.390 --> 01:26:47.055
And the adult cortex has
these power law distributions,

01:26:47.055 --> 01:26:49.500
and they're great
because they optimize.

01:26:49.500 --> 01:26:51.850
They've got lots of stable,
local communication,

01:26:51.850 --> 01:26:53.620
but there's still
the ability to do

01:26:53.620 --> 01:26:55.940
creative long-distance
connections.

01:26:55.940 --> 01:26:58.010
So that's great.

01:26:58.010 --> 01:26:59.110
But how do you get that?

01:26:59.110 --> 01:27:01.640
How does the nervous
system wire up this way?

01:27:01.640 --> 01:27:04.180
And it does swarm intelligence.

01:27:04.180 --> 01:27:09.450
The developing cortex does a
swarm intelligence solution.

01:27:09.450 --> 01:27:13.780
When the cortex is
first developing,

01:27:13.780 --> 01:27:18.530
what you will have is a
first generation, a pioneer

01:27:18.530 --> 01:27:22.550
generation, a pioneer
generation of cells.

01:27:22.550 --> 01:27:27.440
The cortex surface, all of
that, that there is a pioneer

01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:30.380
generation of cells
that basically grow

01:27:30.380 --> 01:27:32.920
processes up like these.

01:27:32.920 --> 01:27:36.420
And these are called
radial glial cells.

01:27:36.420 --> 01:27:39.740
What they are, they're the
ants with the first generation

01:27:39.740 --> 01:27:41.710
of setting down the trail here.

01:27:41.710 --> 01:27:43.850
They're the first
bees coming in.

01:27:43.850 --> 01:27:46.160
And what you then
have, the neurons

01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:49.190
are the second-generation
random wanderers.

01:27:49.190 --> 01:27:50.830
And what they do
is they come in.

01:27:50.830 --> 01:27:52.540
And as they begin
to develop, they

01:27:52.540 --> 01:27:55.380
have rules that, when
they hit a radial glia,

01:27:55.380 --> 01:27:57.020
they grow up along it.

01:27:57.020 --> 01:27:59.510
They migrate along it,
they throw up connections.

01:27:59.510 --> 01:28:01.870
And you do that with
enough of the cortex, which

01:28:01.870 --> 01:28:05.600
is hundreds of millions of
billions of neurons in there,

01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:09.620
and you get optimal
power law distributions.

01:28:09.620 --> 01:28:13.230
All you need are some
very simple local rules.

01:28:13.230 --> 01:28:17.440
And out of that emerges
an optimally wired cortex.

01:28:17.440 --> 01:28:22.190
And it's the same simple
emergent stuff going on.

01:28:22.190 --> 01:28:23.000
OK.

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:26.420
So how do we begin to really
apply this stuff to humans?

01:28:26.420 --> 01:28:29.090
Because it winds up being
very pertinent and making

01:28:29.090 --> 01:28:31.690
sense of some of the most
interesting complex things

01:28:31.690 --> 01:28:32.820
about us.

01:28:32.820 --> 01:28:37.300
So what's the difference between
humans and every other species?

01:28:37.300 --> 01:28:39.200
Nothing all that exciting.

01:28:39.200 --> 01:28:41.490
From a neurobiological
standpoint,

01:28:41.490 --> 01:28:45.240
you've got this real challenge,
which is, you look at a neuron

01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:47.480
from a fruit fly
under a microscope

01:28:47.480 --> 01:28:49.927
and you look at one
from us and it's

01:28:49.927 --> 01:28:51.530
going to look kind of the same.

01:28:51.530 --> 01:28:53.410
Looking at a single
neuron, you can't tell

01:28:53.410 --> 01:28:54.990
which species it came from.

01:28:54.990 --> 01:28:58.020
We have the same kind
of neurotransmitters

01:28:58.020 --> 01:29:00.690
that a worm uses in
its nervous system.

01:29:00.690 --> 01:29:03.300
We've got the same
kind of ion channels,

01:29:03.300 --> 01:29:06.540
the same sort of excitability,
the same action potentials.

01:29:06.540 --> 01:29:08.500
You know, minor
details are different.

01:29:08.500 --> 01:29:11.350
We have not become
humans by inventing

01:29:11.350 --> 01:29:15.340
new types of brain cells and new
types of chemical messengers.

01:29:15.340 --> 01:29:18.490
We have the same basic
off-the-rack neuron

01:29:18.490 --> 01:29:20.220
that a fly does.

01:29:20.220 --> 01:29:21.150
Oh.

01:29:21.150 --> 01:29:25.200
We have very similar
basic building blocks.

01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:26.830
What's the
difference, of course,

01:29:26.830 --> 01:29:30.540
is we've got 100 million
of them for every neuron

01:29:30.540 --> 01:29:32.760
that you find in a fly brain.

01:29:32.760 --> 01:29:36.430
And out of that comes
emergent properties.

01:29:36.430 --> 01:29:37.630
Great story.

01:29:37.630 --> 01:29:39.550
Garry KAS-pah-rof,
kas-PAH-rof, I never

01:29:39.550 --> 01:29:42.290
remember which
syllable to emphasize.

01:29:42.290 --> 01:29:45.980
Grandmaster Russian, chess
grandmaster in the '90s.

01:29:45.980 --> 01:29:49.120
And apparently he's rated as one
of the strongest of all times.

01:29:49.120 --> 01:29:52.350
And he was the
person who wound up

01:29:52.350 --> 01:29:55.360
participating in this
really major event, which

01:29:55.360 --> 01:29:58.710
was this tournament with
this chess-playing computer

01:29:58.710 --> 01:30:04.209
that IBM had built called Deep
Blue or Big Blue or Old Yeller.

01:30:04.209 --> 01:30:05.000
What was it called?

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.620
Deep Blue, Deep Blue, Deep Blue.

01:30:07.620 --> 01:30:09.250
And they played
against each other.

01:30:09.250 --> 01:30:13.470
And apparently what happened
was, in the first game,

01:30:13.470 --> 01:30:15.780
Kasparov won perhaps.

01:30:15.780 --> 01:30:19.030
And the computer was able
to modify its strategy

01:30:19.030 --> 01:30:21.630
and then proceeded to
mop the floor with him.

01:30:21.630 --> 01:30:25.120
And this was a landmark
event in computer science.

01:30:25.120 --> 01:30:27.700
This was the first
time that a computer

01:30:27.700 --> 01:30:31.090
had beaten a chess grandmaster.

01:30:31.090 --> 01:30:33.000
Amazing event.

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:34.790
Not surprisingly,
afterward Kasparov

01:30:34.790 --> 01:30:36.590
is all bummed out and depressed.

01:30:36.590 --> 01:30:39.220
And his friends were trying
to make him feel better.

01:30:39.220 --> 01:30:43.210
And they go to him and they say,
look, all you got done in by

01:30:43.210 --> 01:30:44.520
is quantity.

01:30:44.520 --> 01:30:46.370
All you got done
in by is the fact

01:30:46.370 --> 01:30:48.530
that that computer could
do a whole lot more

01:30:48.530 --> 01:30:52.040
computations than you could
in a set amount of time.

01:30:52.040 --> 01:30:54.720
I'm told, apparently
chess grandmaster types

01:30:54.720 --> 01:30:57.024
can see five, six moves ahead.

01:30:57.024 --> 01:30:59.190
And they can intuit where
the interesting ones were.

01:30:59.190 --> 01:31:03.840
And Deep Blue could calculate
every single possible outcome,

01:31:03.840 --> 01:31:05.747
like, seven, eight
moves in advance.

01:31:05.747 --> 01:31:07.580
And every time, it would
simply pick the one

01:31:07.580 --> 01:31:08.850
that was the best outcome.

01:31:08.850 --> 01:31:12.160
It was like generating solutions
to the traveling salesman

01:31:12.160 --> 01:31:12.920
problem.

01:31:12.920 --> 01:31:16.090
Kasparov didn't have a
chance because the computer

01:31:16.090 --> 01:31:18.850
could simply generate
enough solutions

01:31:18.850 --> 01:31:20.400
to pick the right one.

01:31:20.400 --> 01:31:21.950
So all of them
are saying to him,

01:31:21.950 --> 01:31:24.850
you should not be depressed
because all that computer had

01:31:24.850 --> 01:31:27.180
going for it was quantity.

01:31:27.180 --> 01:31:29.030
And what he said
in response was,

01:31:29.030 --> 01:31:33.520
yeah, but with enough
quantity you invent quality.

01:31:33.520 --> 01:31:35.890
And that's the exact
equivalent of one ant

01:31:35.890 --> 01:31:38.570
makes no sense and 10,000 do.

01:31:38.570 --> 01:31:41.180
That's the exact equivalent,
with enough of these elements

01:31:41.180 --> 01:31:42.510
here, you optimize.

01:31:42.510 --> 01:31:44.610
We do not have
fancy neurons that

01:31:44.610 --> 01:31:46.690
are different than
in any other species.

01:31:46.690 --> 01:31:48.500
We've just got more of them.

01:31:48.500 --> 01:31:52.800
And simple nearest neighbor
rules, and you throw a million

01:31:52.800 --> 01:31:54.760
of them together and
you get a fruit fly.

01:31:54.760 --> 01:31:56.640
And you throw 100
billion of them together

01:31:56.640 --> 01:32:00.030
and you get poetry and you get
symphonies and you get theology

01:32:00.030 --> 01:32:01.180
and you get all of that.

01:32:01.180 --> 01:32:03.520
And it's the same
building blocks.

01:32:03.520 --> 01:32:07.070
With enough quantity,
you invent quality.

01:32:07.070 --> 01:32:09.310
And this is the punch
line that came out

01:32:09.310 --> 01:32:11.710
of really important
work a few years ago.

01:32:11.710 --> 01:32:14.830
OK, we're now, what, 10
years, I think, into having

01:32:14.830 --> 01:32:16.620
the human genome sequenced.

01:32:16.620 --> 01:32:20.850
And about five years ago they
sequenced the chimp genome.

01:32:20.850 --> 01:32:21.660
Soundbite.

01:32:21.660 --> 01:32:23.280
Everybody learned
from whenever back

01:32:23.280 --> 01:32:27.340
when is that the human and
chimp share 98% of its DNA.

01:32:27.340 --> 01:32:32.030
So finally you had these two
gigantic rolls of print-out.

01:32:32.030 --> 01:32:33.940
And here is the
entire human genome

01:32:33.940 --> 01:32:35.530
and here's the entire chimp one.

01:32:35.530 --> 01:32:37.430
And somebody could
finally sit there

01:32:37.430 --> 01:32:40.520
and compare them and compare
them and see, indeed,

01:32:40.520 --> 01:32:42.260
is it 98% shared?

01:32:42.260 --> 01:32:43.730
And that winds up
being the answer,

01:32:43.730 --> 01:32:46.620
even though what that number
actually means is debatable.

01:32:46.620 --> 01:32:51.250
But that brings up the question,
of course, what's the 2%?

01:32:51.250 --> 01:32:53.900
What's the 2% that differs?

01:32:53.900 --> 01:32:57.351
And what has come out of that
have been some very interesting

01:32:57.351 --> 01:32:57.850
findings.

01:32:57.850 --> 01:32:59.980
Some that were
mentioned earlier on,

01:32:59.980 --> 01:33:01.890
which is, they are
disproportionately

01:33:01.890 --> 01:33:06.610
coding for transcription
factors and splicing enzymes

01:33:06.610 --> 01:33:10.290
and, OK, that amplification
of network stuff.

01:33:10.290 --> 01:33:15.980
It is preferentially coding for
non-coding regions, differing

01:33:15.980 --> 01:33:18.130
but non-- all the
stuff from back,

01:33:18.130 --> 01:33:21.160
that lecture for getting
macroevolutionary changes.

01:33:21.160 --> 01:33:23.520
That's how you get a
different species coming out.

01:33:23.520 --> 01:33:25.650
But how about other
types of genes?

01:33:25.650 --> 01:33:27.580
What were some of
the key differences?

01:33:27.580 --> 01:33:30.090
Here was one big difference.

01:33:30.090 --> 01:33:34.230
We have about 1,000 fewer genes
for our olfactory receptors

01:33:34.230 --> 01:33:35.730
than chimps do.

01:33:35.730 --> 01:33:37.900
They've been inactivated in us.

01:33:37.900 --> 01:33:39.820
They're called
pseudogenes in us.

01:33:39.820 --> 01:33:41.000
They don't express.

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:44.250
And that's about half of
the difference in the genome

01:33:44.250 --> 01:33:45.880
between humans and chimps.

01:33:45.880 --> 01:33:47.880
If you want to turn
a chimp into a human,

01:33:47.880 --> 01:33:51.200
you're halfway there if you just
give it a lousy sense of smell.

01:33:51.200 --> 01:33:53.720
That's half the
genetic differences?

01:33:53.720 --> 01:33:55.270
What other
differences are there?

01:33:55.270 --> 01:33:58.860
There were ones having to
do with morphology, bone

01:33:58.860 --> 01:34:01.850
development, probably
bipedalism versus being

01:34:01.850 --> 01:34:03.160
a partial quadruped.

01:34:03.160 --> 01:34:05.840
There are ones having to do
with hair development, which

01:34:05.840 --> 01:34:08.380
is why chimps have all the
hair on them and only those,

01:34:08.380 --> 01:34:11.260
like, disturbing people with
the hair on their shoulders

01:34:11.260 --> 01:34:12.370
have that much hair.

01:34:12.370 --> 01:34:15.480
So that's-- there's differences
in some reproductive-related

01:34:15.480 --> 01:34:16.014
genes.

01:34:16.014 --> 01:34:17.930
You don't want to mate
with them, all of that.

01:34:17.930 --> 01:34:20.520
And then you say,
where's the genes

01:34:20.520 --> 01:34:22.040
having to do with the brain?

01:34:22.040 --> 01:34:23.780
Are there any differences there?

01:34:23.780 --> 01:34:27.090
And there turned out
to be very, very few.

01:34:27.090 --> 01:34:31.080
And they turned out to
be very, very logical.

01:34:31.080 --> 01:34:34.270
The handful that differ
seem to have something

01:34:34.270 --> 01:34:38.180
to do with cell division.

01:34:38.180 --> 01:34:42.840
Have something to do with how
many rounds of cell division

01:34:42.840 --> 01:34:44.880
these cells go through.

01:34:44.880 --> 01:34:47.570
And what you have is,
the human versions

01:34:47.570 --> 01:34:50.160
go through more rounds.

01:34:50.160 --> 01:34:52.240
And calculations have
been done looking

01:34:52.240 --> 01:34:54.730
at the average number of
neurons that each progenitor

01:34:54.730 --> 01:34:57.280
cell generates, say, during
cortical development.

01:34:57.280 --> 01:34:59.230
And if you start with
the number of neurons

01:34:59.230 --> 01:35:01.690
that you find in a
rhesus monkey brain

01:35:01.690 --> 01:35:05.530
and have it do three or four
more rounds of cell division,

01:35:05.530 --> 01:35:08.910
you get a human brain
in terms of the numbers.

01:35:08.910 --> 01:35:12.800
Qualitatively, it's
the exact same neurons.

01:35:12.800 --> 01:35:14.480
All that differs is quantity.

01:35:14.480 --> 01:35:16.390
And you put enough
of these together

01:35:16.390 --> 01:35:18.410
and you go from
tools, which are meant

01:35:18.410 --> 01:35:21.950
to get little termites
out, into human technology,

01:35:21.950 --> 01:35:25.230
the difference between us
and them is one of quantity.

01:35:25.230 --> 01:35:28.760
Throw enough neurons in
there, and out begins

01:35:28.760 --> 01:35:32.930
emerging all these
distinctive human things.

01:35:32.930 --> 01:35:35.070
So what does that do?

01:35:35.070 --> 01:35:37.010
That begins to, for
one thing, underline

01:35:37.010 --> 01:35:39.490
what the main genetics
are about in terms

01:35:39.490 --> 01:35:41.660
of the genetic differences
in the brain between us

01:35:41.660 --> 01:35:44.500
and, say, chimps are
genes that free you

01:35:44.500 --> 01:35:46.440
from genetic influences.

01:35:46.440 --> 01:35:50.537
Because those are not
specifying what sort of cells

01:35:50.537 --> 01:35:52.370
you generate in larger
numbers in the brain.

01:35:52.370 --> 01:35:54.290
They're not specifying
connections.

01:35:54.290 --> 01:35:56.720
They're just specifying
larger quantity.

01:35:56.720 --> 01:36:01.130
And all this stuff goes to work
and out comes a human brain

01:36:01.130 --> 01:36:03.280
instead of a chimp one.

01:36:03.280 --> 01:36:05.230
OK, so what does this
whole subject get us?

01:36:05.230 --> 01:36:08.620
The chaos stuff, the
complexity emergent stuff.

01:36:08.620 --> 01:36:11.700
What are some of the themes that
come through with all of it?

01:36:11.700 --> 01:36:15.080
The first one is this
emphasis on quantity.

01:36:15.080 --> 01:36:17.760
You want to get a very,
very fancy system.

01:36:17.760 --> 01:36:21.770
You don't necessarily have
to invent a new type of ant

01:36:21.770 --> 01:36:25.230
or a new type of 0 or
1 in a binary system

01:36:25.230 --> 01:36:27.250
or a new type of neuron.

01:36:27.250 --> 01:36:29.150
You could do it with quantity.

01:36:29.150 --> 01:36:32.700
You get quality, you get
excellence, you get complexity,

01:36:32.700 --> 01:36:37.190
you get adaptive optimization
with huge numbers of elements

01:36:37.190 --> 01:36:39.290
with the very simple rules.

01:36:39.290 --> 01:36:41.160
What's the next theme
that comes out of it?

01:36:41.160 --> 01:36:43.990
One that is totally
counterintuitive.

01:36:43.990 --> 01:36:45.760
Once again, like
this whole subject

01:36:45.760 --> 01:36:48.140
that shoots reductionism
down the drain,

01:36:48.140 --> 01:36:49.830
totally counterintuitive.

01:36:49.830 --> 01:36:55.120
The simpler the constituent
parts, the better.

01:36:55.120 --> 01:36:58.450
Fancy, complicated ants that
are specialized and have

01:36:58.450 --> 01:37:00.040
all sorts of different rules.

01:37:00.040 --> 01:37:02.810
They are not going to
generate swarm intelligence

01:37:02.810 --> 01:37:07.340
as effectively as do systems
with the simpler elements.

01:37:07.340 --> 01:37:10.780
The more simple the building
blocks are, the better.

01:37:10.780 --> 01:37:12.940
Something else that
is intrinsic to all

01:37:12.940 --> 01:37:14.880
of this, which runs
counter to all sorts

01:37:14.880 --> 01:37:19.310
of rational intuitions, which
is more random interactions

01:37:19.310 --> 01:37:21.680
make for better, more
adaptive networks.

01:37:21.680 --> 01:37:24.710
You want lots of
random noise thrown

01:37:24.710 --> 01:37:28.660
in there because that's how you
stumble onto optimal solutions.

01:37:28.660 --> 01:37:31.130
Randomness is a good thing.

01:37:31.130 --> 01:37:34.560
And remember, right at the time
that we're making new neurons

01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:38.350
in the cortex, that's when you
induce the transposable events

01:37:38.350 --> 01:37:39.370
in the genome.

01:37:39.370 --> 01:37:43.900
That's where you juggle the
DNA producing randomness there.

01:37:43.900 --> 01:37:45.790
Randomness is a good thing.

01:37:45.790 --> 01:37:49.520
Randomness adds to the
excellence of networks

01:37:49.520 --> 01:37:50.490
What else?

01:37:50.490 --> 01:37:52.620
Next thing as a theme
that comes out of it

01:37:52.620 --> 01:37:57.100
is the power of
gradients of information.

01:37:57.100 --> 01:38:00.960
Things that guide you,
you a cell, you an ant,

01:38:00.960 --> 01:38:03.510
you a commercial district.

01:38:03.510 --> 01:38:05.890
Things that can guide
you towards things,

01:38:05.890 --> 01:38:08.530
things that can
repel you, gradients

01:38:08.530 --> 01:38:10.932
of attraction and repulsion.

01:38:10.932 --> 01:38:12.390
And that's exactly
what's going on.

01:38:12.390 --> 01:38:14.750
There is a gradient
in magnets when

01:38:14.750 --> 01:38:18.060
they're this close and the power
that they have is dropping off.

01:38:18.060 --> 01:38:20.670
As they move,
gradients provide a lot

01:38:20.670 --> 01:38:23.530
of the optimization
in these systems.

01:38:23.530 --> 01:38:28.030
Very, very important as well is
nearest neighbor interactions.

01:38:28.030 --> 01:38:30.420
These are not just a
handful of simple rules

01:38:30.420 --> 01:38:33.250
about how you're interacting
with somebody in Chicago.

01:38:33.250 --> 01:38:36.610
These are all how you
interact with another ant,

01:38:36.610 --> 01:38:40.400
another bee when you bump
into it, a glial cell.

01:38:40.400 --> 01:38:43.830
Local interactions
with simple rules.

01:38:43.830 --> 01:38:44.820
Something else.

01:38:44.820 --> 01:38:47.030
Another one that
runs totally counter

01:38:47.030 --> 01:38:49.930
to intuition, which
is generalists

01:38:49.930 --> 01:38:53.740
work better in these
systems than specialists do.

01:38:53.740 --> 01:38:56.470
Generalists are more
likely to come up

01:38:56.470 --> 01:38:59.380
with these adaptive outcomes.

01:38:59.380 --> 01:39:02.730
OK, so what does all of
this mean on a larger level?

01:39:02.730 --> 01:39:06.350
And what I think is
that this is where

01:39:06.350 --> 01:39:09.460
the complexity of human brains
and human behaviors come from,

01:39:09.460 --> 01:39:11.340
these emergent properties.

01:39:11.340 --> 01:39:14.130
And this is now a generation
or two into people

01:39:14.130 --> 01:39:15.750
thinking about this stuff.

01:39:15.750 --> 01:39:19.040
And it is incredibly
hard to think about.

01:39:19.040 --> 01:39:21.700
And most of the work
I do and my peers do

01:39:21.700 --> 01:39:24.170
is reductive stuff
that is very limited.

01:39:24.170 --> 01:39:26.770
And like, I don't
understand how to think

01:39:26.770 --> 01:39:28.040
about it in this other way.

01:39:28.040 --> 01:39:30.020
And the odds are,
you guys are not

01:39:30.020 --> 01:39:31.990
going to be good
enough at it either.

01:39:31.990 --> 01:39:35.610
You're good enough that you were
a first generation growing up

01:39:35.610 --> 01:39:37.540
that knows, if you
want to find out

01:39:37.540 --> 01:39:39.200
if you're going to
like a movie or not,

01:39:39.200 --> 01:39:42.330
you don't need to have
somebody with expertise

01:39:42.330 --> 01:39:45.720
and a label on their forehead
and a blueprint and top down.

01:39:45.720 --> 01:39:47.330
You don't need critics anymore.

01:39:47.330 --> 01:39:49.170
You have bottom-up systems.

01:39:49.170 --> 01:39:51.620
You guys who are first
generation growing up

01:39:51.620 --> 01:39:53.520
thinking in that way.

01:39:53.520 --> 01:39:55.400
What's a consequence of that?

01:39:55.400 --> 01:39:57.660
You are beginning to get
better at this stuff.

01:39:57.660 --> 01:40:00.872
And my guess is, it's not
until, like, your grandkids

01:40:00.872 --> 01:40:02.580
that you're going to
have people thinking

01:40:02.580 --> 01:40:05.340
so much in the emergent
systems that we're finally

01:40:05.340 --> 01:40:07.910
going to be able to figure
out what the brain is doing.

01:40:07.910 --> 01:40:10.570
And where you see
there is all sorts

01:40:10.570 --> 01:40:12.280
of things that can happen.

01:40:12.280 --> 01:40:14.860
If there was more
bottom-up communication

01:40:14.860 --> 01:40:16.890
in the trenches in
World War I, they

01:40:16.890 --> 01:40:18.530
would have stopped the war.

01:40:18.530 --> 01:40:20.970
All these emergent
things bottom up.

01:40:20.970 --> 01:40:24.480
We've now had
revolutions when Marcos

01:40:24.480 --> 01:40:25.970
was overthrown in
the Philippines

01:40:25.970 --> 01:40:28.310
back when that was
basically bloodless.

01:40:28.310 --> 01:40:29.970
When the Czech
revolution occurred,

01:40:29.970 --> 01:40:31.580
it was called the
Velvet Revolution

01:40:31.580 --> 01:40:33.410
because there was no violence.

01:40:33.410 --> 01:40:36.220
All they had to do was get
enough people in the town

01:40:36.220 --> 01:40:39.430
square in the capital
and paralyze the country,

01:40:39.430 --> 01:40:40.950
and they took it over.

01:40:40.950 --> 01:40:43.730
I will predict that
within our lifetime

01:40:43.730 --> 01:40:45.330
there is going to
be a revolution

01:40:45.330 --> 01:40:47.800
in some country at
some point where nobody

01:40:47.800 --> 01:40:49.540
leaves their living rooms.

01:40:49.540 --> 01:40:52.380
All they do is do
something online

01:40:52.380 --> 01:40:54.690
with some emergent
bottom-up thing

01:40:54.690 --> 01:40:58.610
and they collapse the government
and do it in and no one

01:40:58.610 --> 01:41:01.270
will have to leave their
living room because it will be

01:41:01.270 --> 01:41:03.670
all emergent things coming up.

01:41:03.670 --> 01:41:05.650
The final couple of points here.

01:41:05.650 --> 01:41:10.060
First one is, all that chaotic,
strange, attractor stuff, all

01:41:10.060 --> 01:41:12.360
of us spend a lot
of time thinking

01:41:12.360 --> 01:41:16.570
about how we're not quite
up to the ideal this or not.

01:41:16.570 --> 01:41:18.750
We're not at the
ideal appearance.

01:41:18.750 --> 01:41:20.250
We're not at the
ideal intelligence.

01:41:20.250 --> 01:41:22.140
We're not at the ideal
choice of perfume.

01:41:22.140 --> 01:41:23.590
We're not at the ideal anything.

01:41:23.590 --> 01:41:25.815
What strange attractors
and chaos shows

01:41:25.815 --> 01:41:28.800
you is the notion that
there is an ideal,

01:41:28.800 --> 01:41:32.750
that there is an essentialist
optimal, whatever, is a myth.

01:41:32.750 --> 01:41:35.590
We are all deviating
from the optima

01:41:35.590 --> 01:41:39.670
because the optima is just
an emergent, imaginary thing.

01:41:39.670 --> 01:41:42.600
The other final point is,
something that you guys are

01:41:42.600 --> 01:41:45.670
going to be much better at
than any previous generation,

01:41:45.670 --> 01:41:47.450
which, if you grow
up thinking, when

01:41:47.450 --> 01:41:49.590
I want to find out if
a movie is good or not,

01:41:49.590 --> 01:41:53.550
I do bottom-up stuff, you
are growing up with a mindset

01:41:53.550 --> 01:41:55.970
that you don't need blueprints.

01:41:55.970 --> 01:41:59.150
You don't need
top-down blueprints.

01:41:59.150 --> 01:42:01.680
And implicit in
that, when you look

01:42:01.680 --> 01:42:05.820
at how you can get complex,
adaptive, optimized systems

01:42:05.820 --> 01:42:08.140
without blueprints is
the fact that, if you

01:42:08.140 --> 01:42:10.820
don't need blueprints,
you don't need somebody

01:42:10.820 --> 01:42:12.610
who makes the blueprints.

01:42:12.610 --> 01:42:15.090
And it will be a lot
easier to comprehend that

01:42:15.090 --> 01:42:16.410
as being the case.

01:42:16.410 --> 01:42:20.900
You don't have to have a
source of top-down instruction

01:42:20.900 --> 01:42:22.747
if you don't need a blueprint.

01:42:22.747 --> 01:42:23.580
OK, so I don't know.

01:42:23.580 --> 01:42:25.470
I'm talking about something--

01:42:25.470 --> 01:42:28.990
