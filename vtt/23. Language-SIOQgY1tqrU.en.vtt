00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.470
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:08.050
Stanford University.

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:08.800
Let's get started.

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:18.080
We switch to our next subject,
where the overall plan

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.540
could be summarized
like that, as you well

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.030
know by now-- looking
at the language,

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:26.610
looking at the biological
roots of the interactions

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.360
with the environment,
all the deal

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.590
that we have under
our belts by now.

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.220
Same strategy as usual,
starting off with the behavior,

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.280
and then working our way back.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.430
First off, two announcements
before I forget.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.160
One is we're not going to
have a lecture on depression.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.460
The remaining lectures will
be Wednesday schizophrenia,

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.980
Friday is biology of religion,
and the following Wednesday

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.240
is the final lecture
personality disorders

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.840
individual differences.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.960
And apropos of that, not
positive at the moment,

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.020
but I'm leaning towards
the last two lectures

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.170
not being taped for
a number of reasons.

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.740
OK, also one final
point from Wednesday,

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.350
from Friday's lecture,
the complexity one,

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.450
back to that business, swarm
intelligence, and being

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.090
able to solve the traveling
salesman problem for you

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.140
with remarkable efficiency,
that business again

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.740
about how the cortex wires
up that two generation

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.420
business of cells,
the first cells being

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.100
those radial glia
that established

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.900
sort of a super structure,
the second generation

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.080
then being the neurons that
do the random laundering, hit

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.060
and grow up there, and then
wire up in these optimal nodes.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.250
What you also get is a version
intrinsic in that it is solving

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.330
the traveling salesman problem.

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.990
If you think about
it, if you've got

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.990
20, 30 billion cortical
neurons there, and all of them

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.730
are wiring up to
10,000 other neurons,

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.440
depending on how
efficiently you pack it,

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.050
you could have a hundred
gazillion miles of axons

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.940
that you have to grow, or just
a couple of kilometers worth.

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.770
And, again, the pressure is
to come up with the traveling

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.340
salesman efficiency to be
able to pull off the wiring

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.790
that you want with the minimal
amount of expenditure of axons.

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.800
And what you see when
you look at the way

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.000
the cortex does wire
up people working

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.920
on this showing remarkably
efficient solutions coming out

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.980
of that brain's equivalent
of doing swarm intelligence.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.880
So language, starting off with
our usual strategy-- starting

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.170
off with what the
behaviors look like.

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.230
And the place to
begin is with some

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.190
of the universals of language.

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.040
Across all the different human
languages, approximately 6,000

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.900
of them, and all sorts
of depressing news

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.200
about that to come.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.570
First off, something that
they all have in common

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.160
is semanticity-- the
notion that there

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.000
is an endless array,
an infinite array,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.270
of sounds that could
be generated by voices.

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.750
And what all languages do is
bucket them, as per usual,

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.400
break up this continuum of
sounds into units of meaning,

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.960
and where meaning corresponds
to the unit itself.

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.180
The notion of that
being a pair of people

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.850
we'll more about later--
Marc Hauser, Noam Chomsky,

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.990
pointing out that even
though you could generate

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:25.050
an infinite number of words, you
could never generate 6.5 words.

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.560
That's part of what
semanticity is about.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.810
Not only do you break
continuum of sounds

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.210
into buckets of meaning.

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:34.430
But they are discrete buckets.

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.290
You cannot have partial words.

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.110
Also, what else is
universal to languages?

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.990
The possibility of
embedded clauses.

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.700
And ones that get
considerably more complicated,

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.850
all languages not
only have a can do b.

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.260
But they all have a
under this condition,

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.750
but not under that condition,
and sometimes on Tuesdays

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.380
but never on Thursdays can do b.

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.460
All of them will
have embedded clauses

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.020
like that, that
being a universal.

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:03.320
What else?

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.620
All of them show
recursion, which

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.540
is a really important property.

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.700
Old term for it would be
something like generativity,

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.880
which is all languages have
a finite number of words.

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.140
And all languages
have the potential

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:21.089
to generate an infinite
number of combinations.

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:23.810
And all you have to
do see that is come up

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.070
with what you believe
is the longest sentence

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.330
in all of history.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.550
And all you have to do is put
at the beginning of it Bill said

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.590
that, blah, blah.

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.100
And once that's
there, then you have

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.460
to have Jane said
that Bill said that.

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.195
And, thus, you have an
infinite generativity.

00:04:41.195 --> 00:04:43.700
All languages, finite
number of words,

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.860
infinite number of combinations.

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:46.680
What else?

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.230
Very important feature
of human language

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:52.500
when we get to comparing it
with animal communication--

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.890
displacement.

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:56.800
We can talk about
stuff from the past.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.330
We can talk about
stuff from the future.

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.540
We can talk about stuff on
the other side of the planet.

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.710
We can talk about
things that are

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.180
emotionally distant from us.

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.100
And as we'll see with animals,
the overwhelming majority

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:13.490
of animal communication
is about emotion.

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:14.350
I am upset.

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:15.100
I am angry.

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.850
I am afraid.

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:16.520
I am horny.

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:17.180
I am hungry.

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.450
I am whatever it is.

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:22.130
Humans, instead, can talk
about chess strategies--

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:25.070
displacement,
displacement from emotion.

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:29.460
Related to that, there's
arbitrariness of language.

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:30.870
What do I mean by this?

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:33.330
In virtually any
animal species that

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.850
is communicating, for example,
I am terrified out of my mind,

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:40.600
it's going to involve something
resembling that species'

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:45.130
equivalent of screaming and
emoting loudly, and saying,

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:47.330
ah, or some equivalent of that.

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:51.530
We are able to say, I am
feeling a deeply corrosive sense

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:53.770
of disquietude at the moment.

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:57.990
We don't have the actual
words being tied inextricably

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:59.200
into their meaning.

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.510
You cannot look
at a word and say,

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:05.131
whoa that word has an awful lot
of right angles in the letters

00:06:05.131 --> 00:06:05.630
there.

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:07.810
It must be a word that
tells you something

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:10.790
about this type of philosophy.

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:14.330
It's arbitrary relationship
between the signal

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:15.700
and the message.

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:18.170
And that is universal
to human languages.

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:19.730
What else is universal?

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:23.310
The ability to have this
lecture, meta communication,

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:25.990
to communicate
about communication,

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:28.920
to be able to step
back from language

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:30.800
and discuss it in and of itself.

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.760
And one extreme version
of it is to have

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:37.320
people who devote their
times to inventing language.

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:44.680
Two examples-- one is the French
have some national institution

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.580
which is meant to save
the French language

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:48.660
from the sullying
effects of words

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:50.440
from all sorts of
other languages.

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.100
And they make all
sorts of rulings

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:55.024
as to what words are now
allowed to become French.

00:06:55.024 --> 00:06:58.500
And I don't know what they
decided about le Big Mac,

00:06:58.500 --> 00:06:59.550
whether that came in.

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:03.170
But this is a body that
studies and decides what words

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:04.990
should be part of its language.

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:08.220
Similarly, there is a
college in Washington DC

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:11.920
called Gallaudet College,
which is for deaf individuals.

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:15.620
And it's ground zero for
American Sign Language.

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:19.930
It's the place where some band
of sign language elder poobahs

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:24.240
sit around and decide on
new words in that language.

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:26.450
As we'll see, that's not
a very effective strategy.

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:29.650
But nonetheless, that
is meta communication.

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:33.450
Every single language has the
ability to talk about language.

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:36.190
Every single language
and its practitioners

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:39.990
use motherese, use baby talk.

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:44.160
Baby talk where typically the
mother, but not exclusively so,

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:47.640
will speak to a child
in a high-pitched voice

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:50.940
emphasizing melodic and
vowel aspects of it,

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:55.680
repeating phrases, focusing very
closely in on the baby's face.

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:58.670
All of these languages
have motherese.

00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:01.680
And the question becomes,
is motherese about emotion,

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.310
or is it about instruction?

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:07.330
And what you see is some real
similarities between motherese

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:10.090
and how people often
talk to their pets.

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:12.830
And you're usually not
trying to teach your pets how

00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:15.310
to speak your native language.

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:17.750
One difference,
though, with speaking

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:21.530
to pets you get the repetitive,
high-pitched voice stuff.

00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:23.830
You don't get the close clarity.

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:27.170
You do not make a point
of making the sound slowly

00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:28.150
and clearly.

00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:30.880
You are not teaching
your dog language there.

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:32.220
So that is a difference.

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:36.909
Nonetheless, in every single
language, you get motherese.

00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:38.294
Next, you have
what's going to be

00:08:38.294 --> 00:08:39.919
an issue throughout
when trying to make

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:41.304
sense of the biology of this.

00:08:41.304 --> 00:08:42.720
When we're looking
at what's going

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:44.730
on in the brain in
that sort of thing,

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:47.320
is language in those
cases what you're

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:50.400
doing with your lips,
your larynx, your throat?

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:53.420
Is the language mostly
about the motoric aspects?

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:56.650
This is a system involving
the generation of sound

00:08:56.650 --> 00:08:58.150
and the reception of sound.

00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:00.170
Or is it more about cognition?

00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:03.060
Is it more about the
conceptual structure?

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:04.530
And the general
view in the field

00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:07.460
is it's overwhelmingly
about the latter.

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:09.910
And some of the strongest
evidence for that

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:13.320
comes from sign languages--
American Sign Language.

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:18.200
American Sign Language, which
shows all sorts of very subtle,

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:21.840
deep properties that are
similar to spoken language

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.060
amid it not being
a spoken language,

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:27.620
and amid using completely
different systems in the brain.

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:31.720
One example of this-- you
look at babies who are born

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:34.920
deaf and will be learning
American Sign Language.

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:38.460
And right around the age
that hearing infants begin

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:41.530
to babble with their
spoken language,

00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:45.330
deaf babies begin to babble
in American Sign Language,

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:47.620
and are starting to
make signs with that.

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:51.160
Just like hearing babies, they
tend to babble that most people

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:52.400
before going to sleep.

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:53.780
It's the same property.

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:56.160
There is not a rule
that says, somewhere

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:58.670
around nine months
of age, begin making

00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:01.840
sounds that are fragments of
stuff you've been hearing.

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:03.810
Somewhere around
nine months of age,

00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:07.730
begin to practice fragments of
whatever communicative system

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:10.200
you are being exposed to.

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:12.520
Similar evidence
that language is

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:14.530
about the cognitive
structure and not

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:18.280
about lips and tongue--
when older individuals who

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:20.970
are native speakers of
American Sign Language

00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:24.780
happen to have a stroke, they
can get the exact same sort

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:29.080
of communication
disorders in sign language

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:30.637
that speaking individuals do.

00:10:30.637 --> 00:10:32.470
And we'll see that in
more detail, what some

00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:34.140
of these pathologies look like.

00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:38.650
It's coded for in very
similar parts of the brain.

00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:41.380
Both spoken language
and sign language

00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:44.720
have something called prosody,
which we will hear more about.

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:47.510
Prosody is not the
words in a language.

00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:52.090
Prosody is the tone, what you're
doing with your face, what

00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:55.120
you're doing with your hands,
the gestures, your body

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:58.230
posture, all the things
that are communicated

00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:00.570
through those routes
there, all the things

00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:03.040
which virtually by
definition-- email,

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:06.230
you can't do prosody with,
beyond little smiley face

00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:06.800
things.

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:08.840
That's about the
limits of prosody.

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:11.820
You find prosody in
American Sign Language,

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:14.660
people doing very different
facial expressions.

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:17.390
One classic example
of sign language

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:20.840
prosody is if somebody
in American Sign Language

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:24.360
is describing a conversation
between two people they will

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:28.450
subtly shift their body as
they're going from one person

00:11:28.450 --> 00:11:29.660
to the other there.

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:30.730
This is prosody.

00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:32.720
This is reinforcing
the information.

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:36.890
This is a dialogue that this
is exactly what spoken language

00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:39.310
people do in terms
of that prosody,

00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:42.520
the same thing in
American Sign Language.

00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:46.600
Next, amazing bit of evidence
from ASL-- American Sign

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:50.500
Language-- that this is about
cognition, not about lips

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:53.160
and tongue of what makes
it a language, which is you

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:55.610
look at someone
who is born deaf,

00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:58.530
and where ASL is
their native language.

00:11:58.530 --> 00:12:00.940
And when you are
signing to them,

00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:05.990
their auditory cortex
activates, the same regions

00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:10.780
that do some of the initial
processing of hearing language.

00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:14.020
Again, it's about the
deep concepts within.

00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:15.120
It

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:19.440
More evidence-- you get accents
in American Sign Language.

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:22.980
And, apparently, this
consists of different speeds,

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:25.000
slurring, that sort of thing.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.320
And there's regional
accents in ASL.

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:29.710
And I have no idea if
it matches in some ways

00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:31.900
the accents of the
spoken English there.

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:35.110
My guess is no, but
you have accents there.

00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:38.740
You have poetry in American
Sign Language, where

00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:42.490
you will have a sign that
is some movement followed

00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:43.930
by this movement.

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:45.840
And I'm obviously
just making this up.

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:47.970
And then you can
have this movement

00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:49.440
followed by the same movement.

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:51.520
That counts as rhyming words.

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:54.540
You get poetry in
American Sign Language.

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:58.870
And you get storage of
American Sign Language when

00:12:58.870 --> 00:13:02.150
it is a second language in
the same sorts of regions

00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:06.290
of the cortex as when people
get a second spoken language.

00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:09.390
This is not merely
about languages what

00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:11.440
you do with sounds and hearing.

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:14.220
Language is, instead, about
the underlying cognitive

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:15.240
structures.

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:18.600
OK, cool thing, if you ever
start learning American Sign

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:21.130
Language, almost certainly
somewhere on the first day

00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:24.092
they're going to show you what a
cool language it is by teaching

00:13:24.092 --> 00:13:25.050
you the following word.

00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:26.260
This is always
the first word you

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.090
need to learn in
American Sign Language.

00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:30.800
OK just to show you
building blocks of it,

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:33.650
this is the word for milk.

00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:37.320
OK, you can kind of see some
iconic stuff going on there, as

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:38.550
to this means milk.

00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:41.792
So what does this word mean
in American Sign Language?

00:13:41.792 --> 00:13:43.640
Pasteurized milk.

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:45.229
Who said that?

00:13:45.229 --> 00:13:45.895
How do you know?

00:13:45.895 --> 00:13:47.374
Do you know it already?

00:13:47.374 --> 00:13:48.990
It's his favorite joke.

00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:50.110
Oh my God.

00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:53.350
How's that-- identical
twins separated at birth.

00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:56.230
Do you flush the
toilet before you go?

00:13:56.230 --> 00:14:02.320
OK, yes, giving it away,
past your eyes milk, oh, oh.

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:03.210
Can you believe that?

00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:05.700
You better guess the folks
at that Gallaudet College

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:07.700
went out and celebrated
the rest of the day when

00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:09.490
somebody came up with that one.

00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:13.680
Yes, you can have puns in
American Sign Language.

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:17.000
Yeah, it's you and me there
with the pasteurized milk sign.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.880
Yes, the very first thing
you learn in most cases.

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:21.240
This is a real language.

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:22.310
You have emotion.

00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:23.640
You have physical prosody.

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:24.770
You have accents.

00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:25.700
You have puns.

00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:26.970
You have a poetry.

00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:29.620
And it's got nothing to
do with lips and tongue.

00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:31.110
And as we'll see
more and more here

00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:34.970
about the neurobiology of it, it
will be more and more evidence

00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:35.890
for that.

00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:39.310
Thus, we now shift over
to the neurobiology.

00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:42.850
What's going on in the brain,
in terms of language production,

00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:44.320
language comprehension?

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:48.000
Right off the bat, there is
this sort of irritating debate

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.750
that goes on in the field, which
is how modular of a function

00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:54.760
is language in the brain?

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:57.450
Which is another way of
saying neurobiologically,

00:14:57.450 --> 00:15:00.260
how fancy and
separate is language

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:03.690
from the rest of the cognitive
stuff that the cortex does?

00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:05.640
And what we
certainly just argued

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:09.840
with ASL is insofar as
language might be a relatively

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:12.700
isolated module, it's
sure not a module

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:15.350
that's very concerned
about tongues and ears.

00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:17.100
It's about the
cognitive elements.

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:21.290
How different are
the cortical devices

00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:23.500
devoted to making
sense of language,

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:25.340
different from the
other cortical regions?

00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:27.180
And at one extreme,
there's a view

00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:31.070
that talks about the cortex, the
brain, as a Swiss army knife,

00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:34.030
that it has all these separate
little functions, language

00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:37.620
being one of the most
isolated, identifiable ones.

00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:40.140
My sense-- and I
know next to nothing

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:43.170
about it-- is that this
argument doesn't stand up.

00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:45.250
Here's the two things
that people always

00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:48.190
cite when discussing
how much is language

00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:50.950
a cortically modular function.

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:53.630
First one is the disease we
heard about the other week,

00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:55.330
that Williams Syndrome.

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:58.160
And that's that strange
genetic disorder of you

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:03.010
have these kids who are
wildly verbal, and expressive,

00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:06.765
and warm, and affectionate,
and have that weird vasopressin

00:16:06.765 --> 00:16:09.990
oxytocin world
going on with them.

00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:12.960
They're extremely
adept with language.

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:17.150
Yet, they typically have IQs in
the borderline retarded range,

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:19.160
around 70 or so.

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:22.900
Whoa, how can you have
functional language

00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:24.940
amid everything
else being a mess?

00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:28.470
This is an argument for
language as a distinct module.

00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:32.240
Conversely, you have things
called specific language

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:35.540
impairments, which are also
heritable disorders where

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:38.690
you have individuals, where you
have pedigrees, where people

00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:42.330
have a huge amount
of time producing

00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:44.300
language,
comprehending language.

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:46.230
And this is not
sensory problems.

00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:49.570
This is people having
perfectly normal IQs--

00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:52.170
oo, separate module.

00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:55.680
The arguments that both Williams
and the selective language

00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:58.470
impairment disorders
argue for a module

00:16:58.470 --> 00:17:00.520
breaks down with
the fact that when

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:02.930
you look at language
and the Williams kids,

00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:06.930
they're very fluent, and
very generative of words.

00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:09.619
But there's not a huge
amount of meaning in there.

00:17:09.619 --> 00:17:12.410
And, likewise, the people
with the specific language

00:17:12.410 --> 00:17:14.190
impairments, it's
turning out it's

00:17:14.190 --> 00:17:17.760
usually not in the normal IQ
range in these individuals.

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:21.760
So I think, generally, there's
this pretty strong argument

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:24.276
against language
being a strict module.

00:17:24.276 --> 00:17:26.859
Nonetheless, people who actually
think about this for a living

00:17:26.859 --> 00:17:30.320
as opposed to spout off, this
is a very, very controversial

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:31.620
issue.

00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:34.510
More, the next most
characteristic thing

00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:38.850
about the neurobiology of
language is it's lateralized.

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:42.370
Lateralization of brain
function-- the notion

00:17:42.370 --> 00:17:45.570
that somewhere in your
cortex, your cortex

00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:47.030
could be doing
something or other,

00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:50.480
and it turns out that it will
only do that something or other

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:52.190
on one side of your brain.

00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:55.480
There will be specializations
on different sides of the brain.

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:57.520
That goes back to last Friday.

00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:00.700
That's one of the ways you gotta
solve the traveling salesman

00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:01.390
problem.

00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:04.090
If you have these massive
numbers of neurons

00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:08.200
in the cortex, you gotta
start inventing lateralization

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:10.290
to save yourself some axons.

00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:12.940
And it's not until you
get to monkeys and apes

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:16.520
that you see substantial
amounts of lateralization.

00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:19.630
Human brain lateralization
for language

00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:22.480
is probably the most
distinctive lateralization

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:25.530
we've got other than handedness.

00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:29.100
And for that, we begin to
look at the relevant brain

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:30.870
regions going on here.

00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:34.240
How, first, do you see that
brain regions, that language

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:36.100
production, language
comprehension,

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:39.340
is carried out by only
one side of the brain?

00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:42.670
Our usual, ever-reliable
research technique,

00:18:42.670 --> 00:18:46.270
which is getting people whose
heads are damaged in accidents

00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:49.800
or warfare and seeing, you get
damage on one side of the head

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:53.010
and people are far more likely
to get language problems

00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:54.440
afterward than the other.

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:58.910
What turns out to be the
case is about 90% of people

00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:02.740
have language lateralization to
the left side of their brain.

00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:05.860
As we'll see, not so
fast, it's not that clean.

00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:08.730
But nonetheless, you
begin to see that.

00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:10.710
Another test,
another way of seeing

00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:13.180
that which is considerably
more subtle than somebody

00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:17.460
getting their head bashed in, is
something called the WADA test.

00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:20.200
The WADA test where,
weirdly enough,

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:23.830
you anesthetize one half
of somebody's brain.

00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:27.340
You infuse anesthetic
into one of the carotids.

00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:30.110
And you put one
hemisphere to sleep.

00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:32.270
And what you see is you
do it on the left side.

00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:35.430
And most people, they lose
their language production.

00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:39.050
And you do it on the other side,
and other stuff disappears.

00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:41.990
Whoa, that must be a fun
thing to do at parties.

00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:43.270
When does this happen?

00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:45.470
First off, it is very brief.

00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:48.650
It lasts for only a few minutes
or so until the anesthetic

00:19:48.650 --> 00:19:49.460
clears.

00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:53.400
But what you do that for is in
circumstances where somebody

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:55.760
has intractable epilepsy.

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:58.150
And they're good to
go in and cut out

00:19:58.150 --> 00:20:00.150
part of the cortex
in cases where

00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:02.730
it is cortically localized.

00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:05.680
And if it's near what might
be the language center

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:07.160
of the brain, they go in.

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:09.930
And they do a WADA
test first to see,

00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:13.720
is this person doing language
on left side or right side?

00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:16.230
If it's the side where
we're doing the surgery,

00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:18.474
we've got to be that
much more conservative

00:20:18.474 --> 00:20:20.640
in terms of getting this
out, getting the tumor out,

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:21.567
whatever.

00:20:21.567 --> 00:20:23.150
It gives you a sense
of whether that's

00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:24.830
going for the language center.

00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:27.032
And what you do is the
person is sitting there.

00:20:27.032 --> 00:20:28.490
And they're supposed
to be reading.

00:20:28.490 --> 00:20:30.669
Or you're reciting
something to them.

00:20:30.669 --> 00:20:32.460
And they're supposed
to be writing it down,

00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:34.560
or some such a language-y thing.

00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:37.980
And you infuse a barbiturate
into one carotid.

00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:40.840
And, suddenly, 10 seconds
later, they can't speak.

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:42.890
Or they're not
understanding language.

00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:45.250
And you've now
identified that that's

00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:48.350
the side with the
language lateralization.

00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:48.960
I'm not sure.

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:51.040
But my guess would
be that the WADA test

00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:53.830
is going to disappear soon
because you could do it just

00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:55.070
with brain imaging.

00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:56.570
You look at someone.

00:20:56.570 --> 00:20:59.460
You give them some sort of
linguistic something or other.

00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:03.490
And if one side of the cortex
activates preferentially

00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:05.630
in the areas we're
about to hear about,

00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:08.400
you've just identified the side.

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:11.490
So the relevant
areas-- very broadly,

00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:14.980
there are three regions in
the brain, the cortex, that

00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:17.510
are most pertinent to language.

00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:21.200
First one is called
Broca's area.

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:25.100
Broca's area, which is sitting
on the cortex in a region

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:27.430
called the parietal lobe.

00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:31.770
And simply what it is is
it's the bottommost part

00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:36.180
of the strip of the cortex
that does motoric stuff, moving

00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:37.260
your body.

00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:39.230
And by the time you're
getting down here,

00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:41.810
what this is about
is moving your lips,

00:21:41.810 --> 00:21:44.950
moving your larynx,
language production.

00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:47.540
We've already seen it's not
just going to be about that.

00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:51.190
If people with American Sign
Language get a stroke here,

00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:53.440
and they get problems
producing this.

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:56.190
But, nonetheless, on
the first crude pass,

00:21:56.190 --> 00:22:00.540
it's the part of the cortex
devoted to motoric regulation

00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:04.390
of lips, tongues, throat,
larynx, et cetera.

00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:06.920
So what happens when
you get damage there?

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:09.240
General term, an aphasia.

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:12.300
Aphasia is the broad
neurological term

00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:15.610
for being unable to
communicate effectively

00:22:15.610 --> 00:22:18.450
because of a neurological hit.

00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:23.050
You get a Broca's aphasia,
a production aphasia.

00:22:23.050 --> 00:22:26.420
This is someone who now
has a great deal of trouble

00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:30.960
generating meaningful
words, meaningful messages.

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:32.990
It comes out haltingly.

00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:35.980
The actual content
can be quite impaired.

00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:40.400
Amid them, being relatively
good at comprehending.

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:42.720
Then just south of
there, you've got

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:46.670
this area called Wernicke's
area, again named

00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:49.080
for famous poo-ba in that area.

00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:53.250
And this is right near some
primary auditory cortex.

00:22:53.250 --> 00:22:54.890
What's Wernicke's about?

00:22:54.890 --> 00:22:58.630
Of course, obviously it's
about language comprehension.

00:22:58.630 --> 00:23:01.310
And you get someone with
stroke damage to there,

00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:03.330
you get a Wernicke's aphasia.

00:23:03.330 --> 00:23:07.770
And you get someone who just is
fluidly generating of language

00:23:07.770 --> 00:23:09.390
they can't comprehend.

00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:11.290
They can't comprehend
directions.

00:23:11.290 --> 00:23:13.250
Put your right
hand on your left,

00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:14.840
whatever, that sort of thing.

00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:17.780
But what you also see
is they're very fluidly

00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:21.130
generating language that often
makes no sense whatsoever

00:23:21.130 --> 00:23:22.720
because they are
not comprehending

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:24.510
anything spoken around them.

00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:29.500
They produce what is
often called a vegetable

00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:32.130
salad, a language salad.

00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:34.720
Somebody knows?

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:37.410
Word salad, yes.

00:23:37.410 --> 00:23:39.382
OK, you guys come
down teach this.

00:23:39.382 --> 00:23:41.340
I'm going to go back
there and check my emails.

00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:46.160
OK, so word salad-- so you got
Wernicke's, you got Broca's.

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:48.520
You got Wernicke's
aphasias, Broca's aphasias.

00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:53.520
And then you've got this
area, the arcuate fasciculus,

00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:56.380
which was not named for somebody
named arcuate fasciculus.

00:23:56.380 --> 00:24:01.010
But it's the bundle, it's the
set, of projections, the axons,

00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:03.780
connecting Wernicke's
with Broca's.

00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:05.260
So what's that about?

00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:07.970
It's about connecting
comprehension

00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:10.110
to language production.

00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:14.530
In theory, if you had an
absolutely pure wiping out

00:24:14.530 --> 00:24:18.580
of the arcuate fasciculus, and
both these guys were completely

00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:22.160
intact, you would get
somebody who could completely

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:23.320
understand language.

00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:26.120
You could give them complex
instructions, what to do.

00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:27.520
They would be able to follow it.

00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:31.620
This would be somebody who could
produce language perfectly, say

00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:33.050
anything they want to.

00:24:33.050 --> 00:24:36.880
This would be someone
who is incapable of going

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:40.100
from Wernicke's
comprehension to production.

00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:43.160
You could not successfully
say to the person,

00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:45.320
say the word cat.

00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:49.711
They could not connect this
auditory command to production

00:24:49.711 --> 00:24:50.210
there.

00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:53.780
So that would be a pure
arcuate fasciculus damage.

00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:57.320
Not surprisingly, you
hardly ever see anybody

00:24:57.320 --> 00:25:00.740
with stroke damage causing
an aphasia where it's cleanly

00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:02.330
only in one of these areas.

00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:04.930
Almost everyone
who gets an aphasia

00:25:04.930 --> 00:25:08.450
has some sort of a mixed
Broca's, Wernicke's connection

00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:10.340
conduction aphasia there.

00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:12.340
It's always a mess.

00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:15.020
And in the past, but I don't
think we have time for it this

00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:18.820
year, I would bring in a tape to
listen to a number of different

00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:21.830
types of individuals with
aphasias post-stroke,

00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:25.010
hearing a relatively pure
Broca's, a relatively pure

00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:26.070
Wernicke's.

00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:27.820
But those are quite rare.

00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:31.350
OK, so those are some of
the relevant brain regions.

00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:36.340
Production, what you've
got there is motoric stuff.

00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:39.660
OK, so back to--
we've just defined

00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:41.760
that this is the
part of the brain

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:44.440
having to do with your lips and
tongues, and this deal again.

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:45.670
This is about hearing.

00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:48.250
So what about
people who are deaf,

00:25:48.250 --> 00:25:50.670
born deaf, with
American Sign Language?

00:25:50.670 --> 00:25:52.600
These are the
areas that light up

00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:54.610
when they are
hearing, when they are

00:25:54.610 --> 00:25:58.130
seeing, when they are being
spoken to in American Sign

00:25:58.130 --> 00:25:59.170
Language.

00:25:59.170 --> 00:26:01.760
This is the area,
Broca's, that activates

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:03.290
when they are communicating.

00:26:03.290 --> 00:26:06.530
What you've done here
is hijacked-- you know,

00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:08.500
this is traditionally
about tongues, and lips,

00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:09.225
and all of that.

00:26:09.225 --> 00:26:13.150
But we can hijack it for a
very symbolic way of doing

00:26:13.150 --> 00:26:14.840
the same sort of cognitions.

00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:17.320
Yeah, this part of the
brain is for somebody

00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:19.030
sticking a pin in your finger.

00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:22.560
But it's been hijacked to
feeling the world's pain.

00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:27.140
It's making use of new ways that
we're doing stuff here, just

00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:29.250
jamming it into old sites.

00:26:29.250 --> 00:26:31.850
You're going to try to
communicate using your hands.

00:26:31.850 --> 00:26:34.120
And, suddenly,
you're going to have

00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:36.730
to make use of some of
these spoken regions

00:26:36.730 --> 00:26:39.630
there if you don't speak
a language, so that.

00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:45.150
More examples of how ASL is
about the content rather than

00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:48.760
the motoric aspects-- take
someone who is speaking.

00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:51.790
And they're having to recite
a bunch of words quickly.

00:26:51.790 --> 00:26:53.600
And you're checking
them for accuracy.

00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:55.620
And you give them a
distractor that they

00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:57.260
have to do at the same time.

00:26:57.260 --> 00:27:00.551
They have to tap their feet,
their left foot, three times,

00:27:00.551 --> 00:27:02.300
and once on the right,
three times, once--

00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:05.734
and your performance gets
screwed up at that point.

00:27:05.734 --> 00:27:08.150
It's not as accurate, because
you're also paying attention

00:27:08.150 --> 00:27:09.030
to this.

00:27:09.030 --> 00:27:11.730
Now do the same thing with
someone with American Sign

00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:12.230
Language.

00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:14.300
Give them the same
foot distractor.

00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:16.950
If American Sign
Language is heavily

00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:20.750
about it's just stuff you're
doing with your hands,

00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:24.220
it's just another way of
communicating spoken language,

00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:27.070
all it's really about is
tongues, and lips, and throat.

00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:29.820
American Sign Language, what
it's about is motoric stuff.

00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:33.590
If it's motoric, it should
be screwed up by this task

00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:36.600
to a greater extent than people
that are messed up when they're

00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:38.230
using a spoken language.

00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:40.990
It's messed up to the
exact same extent.

00:27:40.990 --> 00:27:42.750
The pertinent thing
about this is not

00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:44.290
what you're doing
with your muscles.

00:27:44.290 --> 00:27:46.390
It's the same
cognitive structures

00:27:46.390 --> 00:27:49.720
that you're tapping into
with the spoken language.

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:55.410
Finally, in that realm, there is
some weirdo whistling language

00:27:55.410 --> 00:27:58.356
that's used on some island
in the Canary Islands

00:27:58.356 --> 00:28:00.230
that people have been
whistling at each other

00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:02.770
and at their sheep for
centuries and centuries.

00:28:02.770 --> 00:28:05.040
And, apparently,
it actually fits

00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:08.450
some of the profiles of
what a true language is.

00:28:08.450 --> 00:28:10.860
There's a very complex
structure to it.

00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:13.000
And what you've
seen in one study

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.660
so far is when people
are producing it,

00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:17.960
they're lighting up here.

00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:20.850
When they were hearing it,
they're lighting up Wernicke's.

00:28:20.850 --> 00:28:24.330
Again, basic off the
rack hominid for a long,

00:28:24.330 --> 00:28:27.870
long time, this is about
ears, this is about tongues.

00:28:27.870 --> 00:28:31.230
And, instead, it's about
the abstract, the symbolic,

00:28:31.230 --> 00:28:33.650
elements of language.

00:28:33.650 --> 00:28:35.820
Demonstrating that
further, depending

00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:38.190
on where you get
the stroke damage,

00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:42.080
there's this whole world
of bizarre aphasias,

00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:44.865
or disorders of communication.

00:28:44.865 --> 00:28:46.250
You get alexias.

00:28:46.250 --> 00:28:50.150
You get agraphias-- people
who can speak, can comprehend,

00:28:50.150 --> 00:28:51.090
can read.

00:28:51.090 --> 00:28:53.390
They simply cannot
write anymore.

00:28:53.390 --> 00:28:55.030
People who can do
all those things,

00:28:55.030 --> 00:28:56.990
they simply can't read anymore.

00:28:56.990 --> 00:29:01.760
People who lose the capacity
to recognize certain letters,

00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:04.150
certain types of words, gerunds.

00:29:04.150 --> 00:29:06.240
There's some gerund
aphasia out there,

00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:08.820
whatever a gerund is,
which I once knew.

00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:11.575
You get all these sorts
of specializations

00:29:11.575 --> 00:29:15.770
by having far smaller strokes,
all these subroutines.

00:29:15.770 --> 00:29:18.210
Apparently, there has
been at least one case

00:29:18.210 --> 00:29:22.080
of an elderly sailor
who had a stroke, who

00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:24.020
had learned semaphores,
which I guess

00:29:24.020 --> 00:29:26.230
was some big thing in
World War II or something,

00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:28.750
and had a semaphore aphasia.

00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:32.320
This is not a very common
hominid event to have happened.

00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:34.600
This is all the different ways.

00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:36.010
This is lips, ears.

00:29:36.010 --> 00:29:37.310
It's reading.

00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:38.715
it's writing.

00:29:38.715 --> 00:29:40.360
It's semaphores.

00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:41.200
It's pantomime.

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:42.410
It's who knows what.

00:29:42.410 --> 00:29:45.750
It's much, much more
abstract than that.

00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:49.330
OK, so you've got
the left cortex,

00:29:49.330 --> 00:29:50.410
with its specialization.

00:29:50.410 --> 00:29:55.200
In 90% of cases, you get
slightly different localization

00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:59.160
of Wernicke's and Broca's, in
particular the areas related

00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:01.820
to reading when you
have a language which

00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:04.910
instead of an alphabet
is a pictograph language.

00:30:04.910 --> 00:30:07.675
For example, Chinese,
a pictograph language,

00:30:07.675 --> 00:30:12.240
you get slightly different
areas of activation, and thus

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:14.420
slightly different
areas of strokes

00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:21.210
will produce a Chinese
Broca's aphasia, or an alexia,

00:30:21.210 --> 00:30:22.460
that sort of thing.

00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:25.640
Doing language as pictures,
as opposed to doing language

00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:27.880
of building blocks of
individual letters,

00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:31.280
slightly localized
differently in the brain.

00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:34.610
So the brain is completely
devoting its energy

00:30:34.610 --> 00:30:37.870
on the left side to
language in 90% of people.

00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:40.580
Lateralized, you don't have
a Broca's or a Wernicke's

00:30:40.580 --> 00:30:41.670
on the right side.

00:30:41.670 --> 00:30:45.100
Destroy the equivalent areas,
you do nothing to language.

00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:49.440
Cut through the brain in cross
section, and on this side

00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:52.200
the cortex will be
a little bit thicker

00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:55.650
than the cortex on the right
side, the equivalent area.

00:30:55.650 --> 00:30:59.540
So language is all about
the left hemisphere.

00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:01.940
So, of course, this is
not true, because you

00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:05.350
get the prosody stuff
in the right hemisphere.

00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:09.040
That's where you get the
coding for tone of voice.

00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:10.680
That's the part of
the brain that's

00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:12.590
telling you if the
person is having

00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:16.220
a sarcastic tone in their
voice when they're saying that.

00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:20.450
That's the area that's picking
up on facial expressions, body

00:31:20.450 --> 00:31:21.090
language.

00:31:21.090 --> 00:31:24.970
All of that is right
hemisphere in 90% of people.

00:31:24.970 --> 00:31:27.560
And what you see
is stroke damage,

00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:30.710
you can get prosody
disorders as well.

00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:33.942
People are perfectly normal in
their auditory comprehension,

00:31:33.942 --> 00:31:35.650
their reading, writing,
their production,

00:31:35.650 --> 00:31:36.730
all that sort of stuff.

00:31:36.730 --> 00:31:40.680
But they can't understand
context of spoken language

00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:44.720
from body posture, from tone
of voice, things of that sort.

00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:49.930
So you can have prosody
damage, right cortex.

00:31:49.930 --> 00:31:53.480
Next, more pertinent
areas in the brain--

00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:57.200
a subcortical region
called the basal ganglia.

00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:59.940
What's the basal ganglia about?

00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:04.345
It tells a lot of your
muscles what to do.

00:32:04.345 --> 00:32:07.220
And, for example, when
your frontal cortex

00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:10.610
has finished wrestling with
all the limbic regions,

00:32:10.610 --> 00:32:15.100
a lot of what the outcome is, is
activation of the basal ganglia

00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:16.620
making you do something.

00:32:16.620 --> 00:32:20.050
Oh, go do the harder but right
thing, that sort of thing.

00:32:20.050 --> 00:32:23.550
Basal ganglia is
about motor stuff.

00:32:23.550 --> 00:32:25.946
OK, duh, this is not surprising.

00:32:25.946 --> 00:32:27.320
This is not terribly
interesting.

00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:30.140
Obviously, language
involves motoric stuff,

00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:32.980
whether it's spoken, whether
it's signed, whatever.

00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:35.140
So, obviously, the
parts of the brain

00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:37.590
that generate relevant
muscle movement,

00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:40.120
they're going to get activated,
also they're involved.

00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:43.940
Just a couple of things that
makes this basal ganglia more

00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:46.970
interesting, though, which
is the next time you're

00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:50.370
talking on the phone or watching
somebody talk on the phone,

00:32:50.370 --> 00:32:54.280
see the frequency with which
they're making hand gestures.

00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:56.980
You're hand gesturing
under those circumstances.

00:32:56.980 --> 00:32:59.900
You're hand gesturing
to your GPS system

00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:01.350
when it's talking to you.

00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:04.000
You're hand gesturing in
all sorts of circumstances

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:07.480
where there is no visual
communication going on.

00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:11.760
Blind individuals, when they
are speaking to each other use

00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:15.220
the same sorts of hand gestures
as seeing individuals do.

00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:18.400
It's not just, OK, we've got to
get the basal ganglia in here

00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:20.150
because we've got to
do something or other

00:33:20.150 --> 00:33:21.730
with our jaw and our lips.

00:33:21.730 --> 00:33:25.250
Something about the
emotiveness is centrally

00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:27.670
tied into the motoric output.

00:33:27.670 --> 00:33:30.750
Because it's impossible
to talk on the phone

00:33:30.750 --> 00:33:33.320
and not to be gesturing
with your hands.

00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:35.320
If you're talking
about anything that's

00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:38.720
at all sort of activated,
or aroused, or emotional,

00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:40.460
your hands are going like crazy.

00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:42.550
And it makes no sense.

00:33:42.550 --> 00:33:46.690
The basal ganglia is really
central to all of this.

00:33:46.690 --> 00:33:50.320
Next, finally, in terms
of a brain structure,

00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:52.650
the rest of the limbic system.

00:33:52.650 --> 00:33:54.310
Totally clear what
that one's going

00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:56.870
to be about, which is
the limbic system has

00:33:56.870 --> 00:33:58.360
nothing to do with language.

00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:00.970
The limbic system has to do
with screaming your head off

00:34:00.970 --> 00:34:02.190
if you're terrified.

00:34:02.190 --> 00:34:04.590
The limbic system has
to do with singing.

00:34:04.590 --> 00:34:06.390
The limbic system,
it's emotional.

00:34:06.390 --> 00:34:08.659
It's got nothing to
do with, OK, let's

00:34:08.659 --> 00:34:12.360
embed a clause here now in
order to express some emotion.

00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:15.920
And what you see is, initially,
a nice clean dichotomy

00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:16.520
with that.

00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:19.230
And a remarkable
thing you will see.

00:34:19.230 --> 00:34:21.550
So somebody has had a stroke.

00:34:21.550 --> 00:34:23.250
And they've got a
Broca's aphasia,

00:34:23.250 --> 00:34:25.750
which is to say they're
having a production aphasia.

00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:29.420
It is really next to
impossible for them to speak.

00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:30.659
It is halting.

00:34:30.659 --> 00:34:31.670
It is broken.

00:34:31.670 --> 00:34:33.100
They can't get the words.

00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:35.199
It is insanely frustrating.

00:34:35.199 --> 00:34:38.020
And one of the things
that speech therapists do

00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:42.699
is get people to sing what
it is they're trying to say,

00:34:42.699 --> 00:34:45.159
because if you make
sort of a running leap

00:34:45.159 --> 00:34:48.620
there and start singing it
before you think about, oh,

00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:53.690
here I am singing the
menu at the restaurant

00:34:53.690 --> 00:34:56.400
for the customers here,
before you start doing that,

00:34:56.400 --> 00:35:00.220
if you can jump quickly into it,
people with Broca's production

00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:04.700
aphasias can sing, often,
what they want to communicate

00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:08.700
because they are sending it
down south subcortically,

00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:12.340
and looping it through
limbic language areas,

00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:15.770
sort of marinating it in
some emotional content--

00:35:15.770 --> 00:35:19.050
music in this case--
and out it comes.

00:35:19.050 --> 00:35:21.390
Not surprisingly,
accuracy is not

00:35:21.390 --> 00:35:23.270
so hot under those
circumstances.

00:35:23.270 --> 00:35:27.030
But it's a lot better than when
you've got the Broca's aphasia

00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:29.220
not being able to speak at all.

00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:31.300
So that's pretty interesting.

00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:34.910
Next thing that suggests that
the limbic system has something

00:35:34.910 --> 00:35:36.560
central to do with
language, you look

00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:38.760
at people with
Tourette's disease, which

00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:40.910
we're going to hear a
lot about on Wednesday.

00:35:40.910 --> 00:35:43.170
And Tourette's
disease, everybody

00:35:43.170 --> 00:35:45.210
knows what Tourette's
disease is about.

00:35:45.210 --> 00:35:48.670
It's the disease where
you curse uncontrollably.

00:35:48.670 --> 00:35:51.650
As we'll see, there's much
more going on than that.

00:35:51.650 --> 00:35:55.070
But cursing, it's all
about limbic stuff.

00:35:55.070 --> 00:35:57.770
Tourette's is
involving not problems

00:35:57.770 --> 00:36:02.000
with Broca's cortical
regions generating cursing.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.840
It's about limbic hyperactivity,
and all sorts of other realms.

00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:08.130
So limbic system
having all sorts

00:36:08.130 --> 00:36:11.880
of access to your
language production.

00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:14.260
Another realm in which
there is clearly,

00:36:14.260 --> 00:36:16.660
the second you think
about it, an intersection

00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:21.680
between your cold, machine-like,
analytical cortical regions

00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:24.530
doing symbolic language
production comprehension

00:36:24.530 --> 00:36:26.840
for you, and your
emotional limbic world,

00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:30.220
this remarkable
phenomenon of you

00:36:30.220 --> 00:36:32.720
can feel better
when you are upset

00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:37.160
about something as a result
of talking to someone.

00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:39.580
Psychotherapy is
completely built

00:36:39.580 --> 00:36:43.030
around the notion that
there are very deep,

00:36:43.030 --> 00:36:47.400
fundamental connections
between one's language world

00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:49.380
and one's limbic one.

00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:51.000
So, again, this is
doing in the notion

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.790
not only that all
language is about is

00:36:53.790 --> 00:36:56.950
motoric aspects of generating
language, and auditory.

00:36:56.950 --> 00:36:59.770
It's about the deep,
cognitive structures.

00:36:59.770 --> 00:37:03.220
It's also not some cold,
cognitive task there.

00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:06.920
It is highly intertwined
with limbic structures.

00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:09.180
As you would thus
expect, studies

00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:12.020
showing that if you,
for example, stimulate

00:37:12.020 --> 00:37:15.020
some subcortical
regions in individuals

00:37:15.020 --> 00:37:17.360
as part of, again,
neurosurgery, trying

00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:20.114
to figure out where
a tumor is, stimulate

00:37:20.114 --> 00:37:21.030
some of those regions.

00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:25.070
And people will say
emotionally loaded things.

00:37:25.070 --> 00:37:28.300
They will say something
very emotionally expressive,

00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:30.010
positive, negative, whatever.

00:37:30.010 --> 00:37:31.680
Stimulate some of
the same regions,

00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:34.900
say, in a rhesus monkey, and
it will give a threat call.

00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:36.150
It will give an alarm call.

00:37:36.150 --> 00:37:37.960
It will give a solicitive call.

00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:40.320
It will express
something emotive.

00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:42.940
So the limbic
system has all sorts

00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:46.110
of ways in which it's talking
to these cortical regions.

00:37:46.110 --> 00:37:48.410
And, not surprisingly,
it's got lots

00:37:48.410 --> 00:37:51.450
of ways of talking
to the porosity areas

00:37:51.450 --> 00:37:53.600
in the right
hemisphere, since that's

00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:55.640
where a lot of the
emotional expressivity

00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:57.780
is coming through--
not in the words,

00:37:57.780 --> 00:38:00.660
but in the tone of voice,
the facial expressions,

00:38:00.660 --> 00:38:02.490
all of that.

00:38:02.490 --> 00:38:07.720
So neurobiology, now looking
at it in a taxonomic context--

00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:09.020
other species.

00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:11.540
Everyone would have
guessed up until people

00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:13.450
actually went and
looked that we're

00:38:13.450 --> 00:38:16.730
the only folks with a Broca,
with a Wernicke's area,

00:38:16.730 --> 00:38:18.830
that this is a human
specialization.

00:38:18.830 --> 00:38:22.080
And what you see is that's
pretty much the case.

00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:26.060
But you see the starts of it
in a number of primate species,

00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:29.580
a number of apes, and
chimps, and orangutans

00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:33.670
In rhesus monkeys, what you
see is the cortical thickening

00:38:33.670 --> 00:38:37.190
just on one side
corresponding to this area,

00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:40.460
not as thickened as in the human
brain in the left hemisphere.

00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:43.850
But nonetheless, you get
thickening like that.

00:38:43.850 --> 00:38:46.570
Moreover, how's this
for interesting-- OK,

00:38:46.570 --> 00:38:49.620
does everybody know
the factoid that it's

00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:51.154
the left side of
your brain that's

00:38:51.154 --> 00:38:53.320
telling the right side of
your body to do something,

00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:54.861
and it's the right
side of your brain

00:38:54.861 --> 00:38:58.210
that's crosswiring,
whatever it is it does?

00:38:58.210 --> 00:39:02.920
OK, get a monkey
who is vocalizing.

00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:05.610
And while it is vocalizing
something communicative,

00:39:05.610 --> 00:39:07.870
while it is doing
that, if it is doing

00:39:07.870 --> 00:39:10.110
any sort of facial
expressions, it's

00:39:10.110 --> 00:39:13.030
more pronounced on the
right side of the face.

00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:15.000
If it's doing something
with its arms,

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.105
it's more likely to
be the right arm.

00:39:17.105 --> 00:39:20.590
In other words, generating
the vocalization

00:39:20.590 --> 00:39:24.190
is preferentially coming
from the left hemisphere,

00:39:24.190 --> 00:39:26.710
and pulling in
more motoric stuff

00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:30.580
on the side of the brain that
operates this part of the body.

00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:33.540
It is lateralized communication.

00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:37.710
The same has now been seen
when you do imaging on monkeys.

00:39:37.710 --> 00:39:39.250
When they're
communicating, there

00:39:39.250 --> 00:39:42.840
is a bias towards the left
hemisphere, the thickened area.

00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:46.550
It's the start of
the specialization.

00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:51.460
Moreover, in both humans and
in other apes and monkeys,

00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:56.320
there is very, very close
connections between the Broca's

00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:59.770
area, or the pre-proto
Broca's area in a monkey,

00:39:59.770 --> 00:40:02.260
and all sorts of
muscle groups having

00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:06.010
to do with facial
expressions-- intensely

00:40:06.010 --> 00:40:08.250
intertwined connectivity there.

00:40:08.250 --> 00:40:10.430
And that's that prosody stuff.

00:40:10.430 --> 00:40:14.270
Seemingly, a monkey making
some of it's emotionally loaded

00:40:14.270 --> 00:40:17.010
vocalizations, there's
some facial prosody

00:40:17.010 --> 00:40:20.690
that goes along with it because
the wiring is very, very

00:40:20.690 --> 00:40:21.980
intertwined there.

00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:25.270
And it's facial stuff that
tends to be lateralized

00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:27.810
to the right side of the face.

00:40:27.810 --> 00:40:32.110
Finally, when a monkey in
a brain imaging machine

00:40:32.110 --> 00:40:35.060
is hearing vocalization
of its own species,

00:40:35.060 --> 00:40:36.700
the left hemisphere
preferentially

00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:42.090
activates in the proto
equivalents of these areas.

00:40:42.090 --> 00:40:44.840
And then, finally
finally, what people

00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:48.980
are beginning to see in
skulls from ancient ancestors

00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:52.940
like australopithecus is
these really tough things

00:40:52.940 --> 00:40:56.920
to infer very indirectly
from endocasts of what would

00:40:56.920 --> 00:40:58.480
be the brain inside the skull.

00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:01.670
But australopithecus a
million years ago or so,

00:41:01.670 --> 00:41:04.120
already a little
bit of an asymmetry

00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:05.626
in the left hemisphere.

00:41:05.626 --> 00:41:07.000
So this has been
something that's

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:12.060
been developing in monkeys and
apes for a long, long time.

00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:15.120
Switching now from
neurobiology, moving back--

00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:17.545
there is hormones
that are relevant,

00:41:17.545 --> 00:41:19.620
and acute environmental
whatevers.

00:41:19.620 --> 00:41:21.420
But we're going to
skip over those just

00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:23.430
because a huge
feature of the field

00:41:23.430 --> 00:41:27.050
is language acquisition,
language development

00:41:27.050 --> 00:41:29.010
early in life.

00:41:29.010 --> 00:41:32.110
And there, you have one
of the great debates

00:41:32.110 --> 00:41:35.720
in the field coming in
around the 1960s or so, which

00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:38.200
was between these
two silverbacks

00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:41.010
in this whole field, both of
whom you've heard of before.

00:41:41.010 --> 00:41:44.780
One, B.F. Skinner, the
king of behaviorism

00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:49.280
who probably was as most
influential by the 1960s 1970s

00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:53.540
or so, and Noam Chomsky,
a champion of a very

00:41:53.540 --> 00:41:54.730
different view of language.

00:41:54.730 --> 00:41:57.650
Chomsky, who is
still around, and who

00:41:57.650 --> 00:41:59.500
to the extent that
I can understand it,

00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:02.230
revolutionized linguistics
when he was about

00:42:02.230 --> 00:42:03.860
four and a half years old.

00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:05.760
And has been the dominant
figure in the field

00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:08.820
for 2/3 of a century since.

00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:11.150
OK, so here was
the basic matchup

00:42:11.150 --> 00:42:12.680
in their wrestling match.

00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:15.070
Behaviorist view--
you can already

00:42:15.070 --> 00:42:18.450
construct what the behaviorist
view of language acquisition

00:42:18.450 --> 00:42:22.110
is going to be, which is
you begin to make a sound,

00:42:22.110 --> 00:42:23.550
attempting to learn a word.

00:42:23.550 --> 00:42:26.340
And if you say it
right, you get rewarded.

00:42:26.340 --> 00:42:27.910
Oh, please feed me.

00:42:27.910 --> 00:42:30.200
Very well said, I'm
going to feed you now.

00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:32.550
And now you've
learned to say that.

00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:34.230
[MUMBLING], you don't get fed.

00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:36.180
And you get severely
hypoglycemic.

00:42:36.180 --> 00:42:39.190
And you try to find other,
until you happen to stumble

00:42:39.190 --> 00:42:40.515
on the right way to say it.

00:42:40.515 --> 00:42:42.760
And, oh, I've been
negatively enforced

00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:44.590
when saying [MUMBLING].

00:42:44.590 --> 00:42:47.230
And I've been positively--
and just do that all the time.

00:42:47.230 --> 00:42:51.300
And that's how I learn language
in a classic behaviorist

00:42:51.300 --> 00:42:52.280
framework.

00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:54.460
Chomsky, meanwhile,
was taking a stance

00:42:54.460 --> 00:42:58.840
that this bears no resemblance
at all to what is going on.

00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:02.250
And what we'll see is
more versions of his view

00:43:02.250 --> 00:43:03.770
have prevailed.

00:43:03.770 --> 00:43:06.980
Basically, the behaviorist
view was just sheer,

00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:07.900
raving gibberish.

00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:10.410
But this produced
these fireworks

00:43:10.410 --> 00:43:14.200
of debates between Skinner and
Chomsky in the '60s and '70s.

00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:15.210
Skinner was at Harvard.

00:43:15.210 --> 00:43:16.750
Chomsky was at MIT.

00:43:16.750 --> 00:43:20.230
And they were regularly lobbing
missiles across at each other,

00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:22.430
and shooting across
their bows and stuff.

00:43:22.430 --> 00:43:25.110
And this was this
huge debate, simply

00:43:25.110 --> 00:43:29.960
because behaviorism was
so totally dominating

00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:33.150
American psychology at the time
with a complete stranglehold

00:43:33.150 --> 00:43:36.270
that there was Skinner, and like
three and a half other people

00:43:36.270 --> 00:43:38.890
out there who had any
sort of academic training

00:43:38.890 --> 00:43:42.380
who would seriously argue
that you acquire language

00:43:42.380 --> 00:43:44.560
through standard
behaviorist rules.

00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:47.950
That was their extreme
view, and a behaviorist sort

00:43:47.950 --> 00:43:51.920
of standing in the sand on that
one, and virtually no evidence

00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:53.180
for it at all.

00:43:53.180 --> 00:43:56.050
So what's the Chomskian
view about, instead?

00:43:56.050 --> 00:43:59.360
The very nature of
language acquisition

00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:01.820
shows that it is
not behaviorist,

00:44:01.820 --> 00:44:05.940
because of a very significant,
critical thing that kids

00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:07.810
do as they learn language.

00:44:07.810 --> 00:44:13.350
A landmark somewhere along the
way, 15 to 20 months of age,

00:44:13.350 --> 00:44:18.030
this major, major event,
the first time a child

00:44:18.030 --> 00:44:23.800
says a combination of words
that it's never heard before.

00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:26.750
I like chocolate ice
cream, says the child.

00:44:26.750 --> 00:44:30.930
Now you say, oh, here, there's
such a thing as Velcro ice

00:44:30.930 --> 00:44:31.450
cream.

00:44:31.450 --> 00:44:33.540
And the child after
tasting it, never

00:44:33.540 --> 00:44:36.212
before having heard the
sentence, I like Velcro ice

00:44:36.212 --> 00:44:38.780
cream, now says, I
like Velcro ice cream.

00:44:38.780 --> 00:44:42.390
It has just generated
a language construction

00:44:42.390 --> 00:44:44.560
that it has never heard.

00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:48.610
The generativity of
language, the possibility

00:44:48.610 --> 00:44:52.390
that kids not only that business
of a finite number of words,

00:44:52.390 --> 00:44:55.390
but an infinite number of
messages, but at some point

00:44:55.390 --> 00:44:57.650
kids do something
which is impossible

00:44:57.650 --> 00:44:59.330
by strict behaviorism.

00:44:59.330 --> 00:45:04.170
They generate examples of things
they have never heard before.

00:45:04.170 --> 00:45:06.640
And this is, in
the Chomskian view,

00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:10.520
this inflection point where
something explosive exponential

00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:11.340
occurs.

00:45:11.340 --> 00:45:12.900
That's where it goes off.

00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:14.840
And there was a
Chomskyte disciple,

00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:17.850
a guy named Roger Brown, who
was a professor for many years

00:45:17.850 --> 00:45:22.350
at Harvard, who did this insane,
obsessive study to actually

00:45:22.350 --> 00:45:25.370
demonstrate what everybody
can infer, like, if they ever

00:45:25.370 --> 00:45:27.770
had kids, which was
having kids where

00:45:27.770 --> 00:45:30.680
he and his band of
researchers would keep track

00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:32.740
of every single
word kids would say

00:45:32.740 --> 00:45:34.100
during their first year of life.

00:45:34.100 --> 00:45:37.090
God knows how the parents
put up with these people

00:45:37.090 --> 00:45:39.180
hanging around in the
nursery and stuff.

00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:42.220
But what they showed
was, yes, suddenly

00:45:42.220 --> 00:45:45.610
you have kids generating
language constructions

00:45:45.610 --> 00:45:48.620
that they have
never heard before.

00:45:48.620 --> 00:45:50.800
And Chomsky has
advanced a whole view

00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:53.630
that there is an innate
structure to language.

00:45:53.630 --> 00:45:56.860
And this is one of the key
bits of his argument, that

00:45:56.860 --> 00:45:59.960
right around a certain
point of development kids

00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:04.270
are able to generalize
the rules of language

00:46:04.270 --> 00:46:08.280
into constructions
they have never heard.

00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:11.410
Moreover, kids are
able to generalize

00:46:11.410 --> 00:46:15.310
the rules of language when
they have only got an imperfect

00:46:15.310 --> 00:46:19.170
instruction by adults speaking
around them who may not

00:46:19.170 --> 00:46:20.450
be grammatically perfect.

00:46:20.450 --> 00:46:22.220
And one individual
may be off here

00:46:22.220 --> 00:46:25.040
or there in one word,
somebody off in another one--

00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:28.270
if nothing else, not producing
every possible combination.

00:46:28.270 --> 00:46:31.900
And out comes a sense
of the grammar from kids

00:46:31.900 --> 00:46:35.990
when constructing rules
out of imperfect examples,

00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:39.750
and constructing completely
novel combinations of words

00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:42.690
that they've never heard before.

00:46:42.690 --> 00:46:44.922
So the argument that
has always been sort of

00:46:44.922 --> 00:46:46.670
at the core of
the Chomskian view

00:46:46.670 --> 00:46:49.950
is when kids suddenly
explode into this language

00:46:49.950 --> 00:46:52.960
acquisition-- to give you a
sense of this, there are long,

00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:56.240
long stretches where you are
learning about 10 words a day

00:46:56.240 --> 00:46:57.310
during development.

00:46:57.310 --> 00:47:01.480
By college, typical person has
a vocabulary of 60,000 words.

00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:03.870
You are not going to
have gotten those 60,000

00:47:03.870 --> 00:47:06.580
from behaviorist reward
and punishment stuff.

00:47:06.580 --> 00:47:08.460
What is this explosion about?

00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:10.720
And what's always been
an argument in favor

00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:13.740
of the Chomskian notion that
there is something innate,

00:47:13.740 --> 00:47:16.770
there is innate drive
towards language acquisition,

00:47:16.770 --> 00:47:20.650
is what's called the poverty
of stimulus argument, which

00:47:20.650 --> 00:47:24.260
is stated quite simply,
kids are generating

00:47:24.260 --> 00:47:27.990
a lot more examples of
language then they're hearing.

00:47:27.990 --> 00:47:30.186
They're generating
all sorts of things

00:47:30.186 --> 00:47:31.310
that they have never heard.

00:47:31.310 --> 00:47:33.980
This whole example
here, kids have

00:47:33.980 --> 00:47:38.481
to be learning in some prepared
learning, ethological way.

00:47:38.481 --> 00:47:40.730
And that's a term that
definitely comes into the field

00:47:40.730 --> 00:47:42.950
because they are
generating constructions

00:47:42.950 --> 00:47:44.710
they have never heard before.

00:47:44.710 --> 00:47:48.080
They cannot possibly
be taught to do that.

00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:51.580
And they are not being sat down
and being explicitly taught

00:47:51.580 --> 00:47:53.360
the structure of grammar.

00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:58.190
They are constructing rules out
of imperfect, partial examples.

00:47:58.190 --> 00:48:00.200
So that's always been
a very strong argument.

00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:02.100
And there's always
been a counter argument

00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:04.530
saying that you
don't have to have

00:48:04.530 --> 00:48:07.750
strict instruction of every
single type of construction

00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:09.660
of words that you generate.

00:48:09.660 --> 00:48:11.830
You can have
statistical learning.

00:48:11.830 --> 00:48:15.450
You can pick up the rules
from statistical patterns.

00:48:15.450 --> 00:48:18.230
And you can do that with
artificial intelligence

00:48:18.230 --> 00:48:18.920
programs.

00:48:18.920 --> 00:48:21.380
And you can do that with adults
who could pick up patterns.

00:48:21.380 --> 00:48:24.910
And a number of years
ago, extremely cool study

00:48:24.910 --> 00:48:27.750
showing that kids
way before they

00:48:27.750 --> 00:48:30.460
start using language--
six months of age or so--

00:48:30.460 --> 00:48:33.980
can actually pick up statistical
patterns in language.

00:48:33.980 --> 00:48:35.970
How would they show this?

00:48:35.970 --> 00:48:39.250
They would have a whole bunch
of nonsense syllables, which

00:48:39.250 --> 00:48:41.220
they would play
long strings of them

00:48:41.220 --> 00:48:44.390
at these kids where there
would be combinations.

00:48:44.390 --> 00:48:46.980
These two nonsense
syllables, the first one

00:48:46.980 --> 00:48:50.470
would be followed by the
second one 100% of the time.

00:48:50.470 --> 00:48:53.460
This combination would be
followed 90% of the time.

00:48:53.460 --> 00:48:56.230
This one 75, this one
10%, this one never,

00:48:56.230 --> 00:48:58.940
and long strings of
these, and showing

00:48:58.940 --> 00:49:03.490
that kids would begin to learn
the statistical associations.

00:49:03.490 --> 00:49:04.850
How do you know?

00:49:04.850 --> 00:49:06.760
Because you play
a novel pairing.

00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:10.167
You get one of these pairings
where 90% of the time

00:49:10.167 --> 00:49:11.000
you make this sound.

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:12.750
And it's followed
by this on the tape.

00:49:12.750 --> 00:49:14.480
Now, instead, you
make this sound.

00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:17.860
And it's followed by something
it's never associated with.

00:49:17.860 --> 00:49:20.990
And the kid's heart rate
increases, because this

00:49:20.990 --> 00:49:22.810
is a novel combination.

00:49:22.810 --> 00:49:24.400
And it is not an all or none.

00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:27.260
It is merely a statistical
linking of the two.

00:49:27.260 --> 00:49:30.600
So really young kids can
do statistical learning,

00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:34.080
picking up statistical patterns
in language very different

00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:36.340
than people would have guessed.

00:49:36.340 --> 00:49:39.096
OK, so now let us take
a five minute break.

00:49:39.096 --> 00:49:40.720
And we will start
marching through some

00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:45.220
of the developmental landmarks
and what the biology is of it.

00:49:45.220 --> 00:49:47.760
What you see in terms of
child development language

00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:50.850
acquisition is one very
clear phenomenon, which

00:49:50.850 --> 00:49:53.280
is right at the
beginning of life,

00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:56.550
a kid could learn any
single language out there.

00:49:56.550 --> 00:49:59.460
There are hundreds and
hundreds of different vowel

00:49:59.460 --> 00:50:02.940
sounds in different languages,
even more consonant sounds.

00:50:02.940 --> 00:50:05.980
And any kid and can
learn any language.

00:50:05.980 --> 00:50:09.310
And what you see in a child
in one to three months of age

00:50:09.310 --> 00:50:13.060
is roughly equal
response to any phonemes,

00:50:13.060 --> 00:50:15.750
any sounds that are
building blocks of language.

00:50:15.750 --> 00:50:19.850
And what development is from
there is you lose that ability.

00:50:19.850 --> 00:50:22.420
As you begin to
acquire your own,

00:50:22.420 --> 00:50:25.020
you start being unable
to hear the difference

00:50:25.020 --> 00:50:26.420
between other sounds.

00:50:26.420 --> 00:50:29.180
And, suddenly, you're back
to taking biopsies out

00:50:29.180 --> 00:50:31.510
of bears instead
of pairs, depending

00:50:31.510 --> 00:50:33.050
on what language you're in.

00:50:33.050 --> 00:50:35.650
As you acquire your
own language, virtually

00:50:35.650 --> 00:50:38.520
by definition in
acquiring it, you

00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:41.310
are losing the capacity
to hear vast amounts

00:50:41.310 --> 00:50:45.190
of phonemic subtlety from
all the other languages.

00:50:45.190 --> 00:50:47.470
By three months of
age, kids are already

00:50:47.470 --> 00:50:49.530
beginning to preferentially
pay attention

00:50:49.530 --> 00:50:54.140
to a spoken language, rather
than nonsense syllables.

00:50:54.140 --> 00:50:57.020
They are already beginning
to note structure of language

00:50:57.020 --> 00:50:59.140
in terms of what
they pay attention.

00:50:59.140 --> 00:51:01.470
By three to six
months of age, they're

00:51:01.470 --> 00:51:04.900
already preferentially paying
attention to vowel sounds.

00:51:04.900 --> 00:51:08.730
They're beginning to learn
that sounds are broken up.

00:51:08.730 --> 00:51:11.930
They're beginning to do that
statistical relationship stuff

00:51:11.930 --> 00:51:13.760
of combinations of sounds.

00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:16.750
Somewhere by about eight,
nine months of age, babbling

00:51:16.750 --> 00:51:20.100
starts, and, again, the business
about babbling during sign

00:51:20.100 --> 00:51:21.810
language showing that.

00:51:21.810 --> 00:51:24.810
What you also see is
when kids start babbling,

00:51:24.810 --> 00:51:27.440
they tend to have stronger
facial expressions

00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:29.670
on the right side
of their face--

00:51:29.670 --> 00:51:33.180
that same argument about the
left hemisphere beginning

00:51:33.180 --> 00:51:35.840
to take some control over stuff.

00:51:35.840 --> 00:51:37.460
What else?

00:51:37.460 --> 00:51:39.260
By nine months of age,
kids are beginning

00:51:39.260 --> 00:51:42.260
to recognize structures,
word combinations.

00:51:42.260 --> 00:51:43.870
In terms of responding
to them, they

00:51:43.870 --> 00:51:48.110
are beginning to have lost
an awful lot of their ability

00:51:48.110 --> 00:51:50.540
to pick up phonemes
from other languages.

00:51:50.540 --> 00:51:52.580
By about 11 months
of age, they are

00:51:52.580 --> 00:51:54.971
beginning to generate the
typical vowels, consonants

00:51:54.971 --> 00:51:55.720
of their language.

00:51:55.720 --> 00:51:58.320
And out of that pops
language soon afterward.

00:51:58.320 --> 00:52:01.530
OK, so a feature of
language acquisition

00:52:01.530 --> 00:52:04.480
in humans which
is pretty bizarre

00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:06.860
is that adult members
of our species

00:52:06.860 --> 00:52:10.210
sit around and invest
huge amounts of energy

00:52:10.210 --> 00:52:14.570
in a one on one level to in an
intentional premeditated matter

00:52:14.570 --> 00:52:18.260
help young ones acquire the
communication of the species.

00:52:18.260 --> 00:52:21.740
We do directed
teaching of language.

00:52:21.740 --> 00:52:23.720
And this is unique.

00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:27.230
And it turns out, this is not
what is found in most cultures

00:52:27.230 --> 00:52:28.490
on this planet.

00:52:28.490 --> 00:52:31.730
In most of them, kids
pick up language purely

00:52:31.730 --> 00:52:35.690
by observation, by hearing,
by being witness to.

00:52:35.690 --> 00:52:39.510
It is a relatively recent,
Westernized invention--

00:52:39.510 --> 00:52:41.390
I don't know maybe in
the last 1,000 years

00:52:41.390 --> 00:52:43.800
or so-- where you
sit down children.

00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:48.200
And you generate simple
examples of the language, which

00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:52.370
you present in a repetitive
way, simple versions of words,

00:52:52.370 --> 00:52:55.570
of grammar, were you
direct it towards them,

00:52:55.570 --> 00:52:59.120
and were you then correct
their attempts at repeating it.

00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:01.250
That's a relatively
new invention.

00:53:01.250 --> 00:53:05.250
And bizarrely enough,
it's not entirely clear

00:53:05.250 --> 00:53:08.190
if that accelerates
language acquisition, which

00:53:08.190 --> 00:53:10.360
would be a real
drag after everyone

00:53:10.360 --> 00:53:13.490
being tortured with phonics
back when or some such thing.

00:53:13.490 --> 00:53:16.510
This is a relatively
new hominid invention.

00:53:16.510 --> 00:53:18.380
It is relatively
rare culturally.

00:53:18.380 --> 00:53:20.650
And it's not so
clear if it actually

00:53:20.650 --> 00:53:23.670
accomplishes a whole lot.

00:53:23.670 --> 00:53:27.960
Now, part of what you also
find with kids beginning to not

00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:31.580
be able to discriminate between
two different sounds in what

00:53:31.580 --> 00:53:34.090
will prove to be another
language other than the one

00:53:34.090 --> 00:53:37.246
they're learning, that begins
to be when you're doing imaging

00:53:37.246 --> 00:53:41.020
there, that Wernicke's is not
distinguishing between the two

00:53:41.020 --> 00:53:43.810
sounds in terms of its
activation pattern.

00:53:43.810 --> 00:53:46.650
That's where you're
beginning to lose the ability

00:53:46.650 --> 00:53:50.640
to hear universality
of language sounds,

00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:54.030
and instead begin to
focus in on your own.

00:53:54.030 --> 00:53:55.530
What else do you see?

00:53:55.530 --> 00:53:57.910
Second languages-- where
do second languages

00:53:57.910 --> 00:53:59.080
fit in with this?

00:53:59.080 --> 00:54:01.660
And there are all sorts
of critical periods

00:54:01.660 --> 00:54:05.200
of development with it,
as to when it comes in.

00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:06.820
One of the ones
that everybody knows

00:54:06.820 --> 00:54:11.020
is if you learn a language
any time after roughly age 12

00:54:11.020 --> 00:54:13.600
or so, most typically
you will never

00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:15.610
be able to speak it
without an accent

00:54:15.610 --> 00:54:16.980
for the rest of your life.

00:54:16.980 --> 00:54:19.920
That seems to be one of the
landmarks, exceptions, blah,

00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:21.100
blah, the usual.

00:54:21.100 --> 00:54:24.830
Nonetheless, that seems to
be, generally, the pattern.

00:54:24.830 --> 00:54:27.690
What about brain coding
for a second language?

00:54:27.690 --> 00:54:31.860
What is found is if you get a
second language before roughly

00:54:31.860 --> 00:54:36.390
six years of age, essentially if
you were growing up bilingual,

00:54:36.390 --> 00:54:41.160
both languages are coded
in very overlapping regions

00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:43.710
of Wernicke's and Broca's.

00:54:43.710 --> 00:54:45.310
How can you see that?

00:54:45.310 --> 00:54:47.935
Because you get individuals
when they have a stroke

00:54:47.935 --> 00:54:51.720
will get, for example, a
comprehension aphasia in both

00:54:51.720 --> 00:54:54.930
of the languages that they
are native speakers of,

00:54:54.930 --> 00:54:56.400
that they grew up with.

00:54:56.400 --> 00:55:00.420
Learn a language after six,
and what you typically see

00:55:00.420 --> 00:55:04.460
is the Wernicke's area that
does the second language tends

00:55:04.460 --> 00:55:06.840
to be a more peripheral area.

00:55:06.840 --> 00:55:09.910
And likewise, what's
activating a Broca's, you're

00:55:09.910 --> 00:55:12.080
not getting the center seats.

00:55:12.080 --> 00:55:14.080
You're not getting
the orchestra seats

00:55:14.080 --> 00:55:16.570
for where you're doing a second
language if it's coming in

00:55:16.570 --> 00:55:17.290
later.

00:55:17.290 --> 00:55:21.200
And, thus, you can get
the truly bizarre cases

00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:23.410
of people who get a
very selective stroke

00:55:23.410 --> 00:55:26.980
and will lose language
and not the other.

00:55:26.980 --> 00:55:28.720
So you begin to get that there.

00:55:28.720 --> 00:55:32.130
What accents are about, what the
critical period is on accents,

00:55:32.130 --> 00:55:33.040
God knows.

00:55:33.040 --> 00:55:37.280
But you have that coming in
there by around age 12 or so.

00:55:37.280 --> 00:55:42.250
Next, acquisition invention
of new languages-- and this

00:55:42.250 --> 00:55:44.770
is relevant in terms of
child acquisition of language

00:55:44.770 --> 00:55:47.020
because of what's a
truism in the field, which

00:55:47.020 --> 00:55:50.300
is new languages are
invented by kids.

00:55:50.300 --> 00:55:52.720
Adults do not invent
new languages.

00:55:52.720 --> 00:55:55.160
Adults may be able to go
to the office each day

00:55:55.160 --> 00:55:56.870
and decide whether
this or that word

00:55:56.870 --> 00:55:58.980
should be protected from
the French language.

00:55:58.980 --> 00:56:02.330
But languages are
invented by kids.

00:56:02.330 --> 00:56:06.470
And what you see with that
is a standard pattern of age

00:56:06.470 --> 00:56:09.680
distribution, of novelty,
which is not only

00:56:09.680 --> 00:56:12.450
do languages tend to
be invented by kids.

00:56:12.450 --> 00:56:15.490
But nobody a whole lot
older than them ever

00:56:15.490 --> 00:56:17.400
learns the new language.

00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:20.240
New languages are
invented by the young

00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:23.220
and have lateral and
downward transfer.

00:56:23.220 --> 00:56:25.140
This is what you see.

00:56:25.140 --> 00:56:29.390
Great example of this-- about
20 years ago in Nicaragua,

00:56:29.390 --> 00:56:32.660
where for the first time
after the revolution

00:56:32.660 --> 00:56:34.610
there, for the first
time there was anything

00:56:34.610 --> 00:56:36.950
done in the country in
the way of education

00:56:36.950 --> 00:56:39.100
for deaf children, who
otherwise were just

00:56:39.100 --> 00:56:42.140
left to sort of languish
in villages, and ignored,

00:56:42.140 --> 00:56:43.710
and not educated,
and all of that--

00:56:43.710 --> 00:56:45.500
the first attempts
to have schools

00:56:45.500 --> 00:56:47.690
explicitly for deaf children.

00:56:47.690 --> 00:56:49.570
And people there
teaching them were

00:56:49.570 --> 00:56:52.719
beginning to grow for
OK, how are we going

00:56:52.719 --> 00:56:54.010
to communicate with these kids?

00:56:54.010 --> 00:56:56.220
What's going to be
an efficient way?

00:56:56.220 --> 00:56:59.170
And worth noting, in addition
to American Sign Language,

00:56:59.170 --> 00:57:00.580
there's British Sign Language.

00:57:00.580 --> 00:57:02.240
And there's French
Sign Language.

00:57:02.240 --> 00:57:03.700
There's all different ones.

00:57:03.700 --> 00:57:06.580
And what began to emerge
after the first year

00:57:06.580 --> 00:57:09.670
or so in the school
was the kids came up

00:57:09.670 --> 00:57:11.220
with their own language.

00:57:11.220 --> 00:57:15.350
They began to generate their
own sign language, which

00:57:15.350 --> 00:57:18.360
over the subsequent generations
became more and more

00:57:18.360 --> 00:57:20.180
mature and sophisticated.

00:57:20.180 --> 00:57:22.260
And we'll see ways in
which that occurred.

00:57:22.260 --> 00:57:25.090
And this is now
Nicaraguan Sign Language.

00:57:25.090 --> 00:57:29.160
This is the sign language that
is taught to deaf individuals

00:57:29.160 --> 00:57:29.750
there.

00:57:29.750 --> 00:57:31.860
And this was invented by kids.

00:57:31.860 --> 00:57:34.149
This emerged from
the students there

00:57:34.149 --> 00:57:35.940
while the adults were
trying to figure out,

00:57:35.940 --> 00:57:39.360
and having conferences,
and meetings, about what

00:57:39.360 --> 00:57:40.780
sort of sign to use for this.

00:57:40.780 --> 00:57:43.470
And there are the kids
in the dorms generating

00:57:43.470 --> 00:57:44.670
their own language.

00:57:44.670 --> 00:57:47.070
10-year-old kids was
the average age there

00:57:47.070 --> 00:57:48.360
where this was happening.

00:57:48.360 --> 00:57:51.400
Language was
invented by new kids.

00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:55.520
And what you saw with the
Nicaraguan Sign Language was it

00:57:55.520 --> 00:57:58.770
took about three generations
worth of school kids

00:57:58.770 --> 00:58:02.440
to have a fully-formed
grammar in the language

00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:06.870
as complex of a grammar capacity
for embedded clauses, all

00:58:06.870 --> 00:58:09.630
that sort of thing, as you
would find in any other sign

00:58:09.630 --> 00:58:10.130
language.

00:58:10.130 --> 00:58:12.110
It took about three generations.

00:58:12.110 --> 00:58:14.470
And with each new
elaboration, it

00:58:14.470 --> 00:58:18.160
was whichever kids had come up
with it, and everybody younger.

00:58:18.160 --> 00:58:20.740
Even after a while,
the original generation

00:58:20.740 --> 00:58:23.340
who had invented
Nicaraguan Sign Language,

00:58:23.340 --> 00:58:25.380
that first generation,
they weren't

00:58:25.380 --> 00:58:28.330
very good at the later,
fancier versions.

00:58:28.330 --> 00:58:32.250
That same deal-- languages
are invented by the young.

00:58:32.250 --> 00:58:35.180
And languages are greatly
shaped, and changed,

00:58:35.180 --> 00:58:37.860
and modified by
the young as well.

00:58:37.860 --> 00:58:39.560
And there's not a
whole lot of people

00:58:39.560 --> 00:58:42.240
older than them who
ever pick up on it.

00:58:42.240 --> 00:58:44.880
So that's a pattern
again and again.

00:58:44.880 --> 00:58:48.570
So acquisition of language,
what's going on in the brain

00:58:48.570 --> 00:58:49.520
there?

00:58:49.520 --> 00:58:54.680
Prenatally, you already begin to
get-- OK, let's cut the brain.

00:58:58.890 --> 00:58:59.732
There you have it.

00:58:59.732 --> 00:59:01.190
There's the brain
in cross-section,

00:59:01.190 --> 00:59:02.450
cutting right through there.

00:59:02.450 --> 00:59:04.610
And what we have,
this is the left side,

00:59:04.610 --> 00:59:08.660
is thickening of what would
be Broca's, thickening

00:59:08.660 --> 00:59:10.600
of Wernicke's.

00:59:10.600 --> 00:59:14.350
It's around 12 to 16
weeks of age in a fetus

00:59:14.350 --> 00:59:18.610
that you begin to see different
patterns of gene expression

00:59:18.610 --> 00:59:22.480
around here versus there.

00:59:22.480 --> 00:59:25.100
And a couple of these are
genes that have already

00:59:25.100 --> 00:59:27.950
been identified
to have mutations

00:59:27.950 --> 00:59:31.310
in families with language
production disorders.

00:59:31.310 --> 00:59:35.950
So around then, begin to have
differential gene expression.

00:59:35.950 --> 00:59:41.700
By around 30 weeks, this part is
now thicker than on this side.

00:59:41.700 --> 00:59:44.950
You're beginning to get
the structural asymmetry.

00:59:44.950 --> 00:59:48.600
Interestingly, during the
first few years of language,

00:59:48.600 --> 00:59:51.440
you don't see
enhanced metabolism

00:59:51.440 --> 00:59:55.220
on this side relevant to that
side when kids are talking.

00:59:55.220 --> 00:59:57.120
Even amid the right
side of their face

00:59:57.120 --> 00:59:59.940
being more expressive,
it's not until a few years

00:59:59.940 --> 01:00:04.870
that you lateralize all the
metabolic activation there.

01:00:04.870 --> 01:00:06.750
Next bit of development
that's pertinent

01:00:06.750 --> 01:00:09.320
is that stuff about myelin.

01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:10.900
Myelin, you remember the axons.

01:00:10.900 --> 01:00:12.440
And you wrap them
up with myelin.

01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:15.655
And your frontal cortexes,
which are not myelinated fully

01:00:15.655 --> 01:00:17.160
yet in most of you guys.

01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:19.220
What you see developmentally
with language

01:00:19.220 --> 01:00:21.830
is something not terribly
Earth shattering,

01:00:21.830 --> 01:00:25.340
which is kids tend to
myelinate their Wernicke's

01:00:25.340 --> 01:00:28.690
area about three months before
they myelinate their Broca's

01:00:28.690 --> 01:00:29.360
area.

01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:31.970
Kids are starting to
comprehend language

01:00:31.970 --> 01:00:33.720
before they are producing it.

01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:35.880
So Wernicke's is
beginning to wire up

01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:37.530
around nine months of age.

01:00:37.530 --> 01:00:40.570
Typically, Broca's takes
a few months past that.

01:00:40.570 --> 01:00:42.940
That's the time course.

01:00:42.940 --> 01:00:47.870
OK, so intrinsic neurobiology
of language acquisition-- how

01:00:47.870 --> 01:00:51.400
about social aspects,
environmental aspects?

01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:53.250
And right off the
bat, we pick up

01:00:53.250 --> 01:00:57.180
on something we heard,
a couple of weeks

01:00:57.180 --> 01:01:00.800
ago, that whole business
about the importance of peer

01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:04.440
socialization rather
than parental influences.

01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:07.530
And that's the work of that
psychologist Judith Rich Harris

01:01:07.530 --> 01:01:10.860
arguing that peer
influences are far more

01:01:10.860 --> 01:01:13.760
important than the literature
has usually given credence to.

01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:16.470
And the area where it
is most clearly the case

01:01:16.470 --> 01:01:18.600
is language acquisition.

01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:21.890
And that was her whole
point as to why kids grow up

01:01:21.890 --> 01:01:25.050
with accents of the
community around them,

01:01:25.050 --> 01:01:27.250
rather than the absence
of their parents

01:01:27.250 --> 01:01:30.560
if the parents were not native
speakers of that language.

01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:34.230
Why do you pick up the accents
of your peers around you

01:01:34.230 --> 01:01:35.980
and those a little bit older?

01:01:35.980 --> 01:01:39.010
Because peers are
pretty important.

01:01:39.010 --> 01:01:41.190
And back to that
issue of it being

01:01:41.190 --> 01:01:43.830
a relatively new
invention for humans

01:01:43.830 --> 01:01:46.420
to try to have somebody
acquire language

01:01:46.420 --> 01:01:48.660
by sitting them
down, and instructing

01:01:48.660 --> 01:01:50.230
them, and correcting
their errors,

01:01:50.230 --> 01:01:51.940
what most of
language acquisition

01:01:51.940 --> 01:01:54.380
has been about for a
gazillion years in humans

01:01:54.380 --> 01:01:58.157
is you learn from your older
sibling, and your cousins who

01:01:58.157 --> 01:01:59.490
are a little bit older than you.

01:01:59.490 --> 01:02:00.770
And they learn
from their cousins

01:02:00.770 --> 01:02:01.920
who are a little bit older.

01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:03.850
And that's where
language is attained.

01:02:03.850 --> 01:02:06.600
And you watch the adults,
and listen to them.

01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:10.170
We're very wired to pick
up our language influences

01:02:10.170 --> 01:02:12.710
from peer groups, and
slightly older ones.

01:02:12.710 --> 01:02:16.410
So her emphasizing right off
the bat that remarkable deal.

01:02:16.410 --> 01:02:18.980
When you think about it,
it's totally amazing.

01:02:18.980 --> 01:02:22.590
Nobody winds up with the
accent of their home language.

01:02:22.590 --> 01:02:25.800
They wind up with the accent
of the community around them.

01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:27.350
For the rest of
their life, they may

01:02:27.350 --> 01:02:31.090
be incredibly good at imitating
their parents in the home

01:02:31.090 --> 01:02:31.900
accent.

01:02:31.900 --> 01:02:34.980
And, surprisingly
early, as I mentioned,

01:02:34.980 --> 01:02:38.090
they do not want to answer their
parents in the home language.

01:02:38.090 --> 01:02:40.240
They start preferring
the outside language--

01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:44.250
all this evidence of the
strong peer socialization.

01:02:44.250 --> 01:02:48.080
What's intrinsic in that
is language acquisition

01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:50.610
also involves a huge
amount of inculcation

01:02:50.610 --> 01:02:54.540
into the values of the society
that uses that language.

01:02:54.540 --> 01:02:57.920
And intrinsic in that is
kids at very young ages

01:02:57.920 --> 01:03:01.570
already getting embarrassed
about their parents' accent,

01:03:01.570 --> 01:03:04.730
and wanting to answer them
not in the home language,

01:03:04.730 --> 01:03:07.700
values built into that.

01:03:07.700 --> 01:03:10.070
Examples-- one that
we heard already back

01:03:10.070 --> 01:03:13.700
in the aggression lecture, that
whole business of languages

01:03:13.700 --> 01:03:17.780
that have a formal you class,
and an informal to and who

01:03:17.780 --> 01:03:19.300
in French, for example.

01:03:19.300 --> 01:03:21.530
And that business
that after revolutions

01:03:21.530 --> 01:03:25.290
as a value statement in terms
of that pseudo kinship stuff,

01:03:25.290 --> 01:03:28.840
everyone is supposed to use
the informal structures there.

01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:32.080
Everyone is supposed to use
the informal conjugations.

01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:35.150
Great thing in
Tolstoy's autobiography

01:03:35.150 --> 01:03:37.400
back when he was a
kid-- apparently,

01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:41.080
at one point, the family nurse,
who adored him and had raised

01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:44.480
him and all of that, one
day sort of spoke to him

01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:47.730
and used the informal
verb tense in Russian.

01:03:47.730 --> 01:03:52.980
And he threw a fit because she
was not of his social class.

01:03:52.980 --> 01:03:55.680
And how dare she
use the informal.

01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:57.990
She should be addressing
him as the young master,

01:03:57.990 --> 01:03:59.660
or whatever the
Russian conjugation

01:03:59.660 --> 01:04:05.080
equivalent was-- that one
laden, laden with social values.

01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:07.770
More examples of this--
different languages,

01:04:07.770 --> 01:04:10.760
very different notions
about relationships

01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:12.430
expressed between people.

01:04:12.430 --> 01:04:16.070
For example, in English you
can be talking to a relative

01:04:16.070 --> 01:04:19.450
and say something like
my aunt, your mother.

01:04:19.450 --> 01:04:22.564
Or you could be saying,
my aunt, your grandmother.

01:04:22.564 --> 01:04:24.810
And that's how you
communicate it.

01:04:24.810 --> 01:04:28.630
In certain languages-- for
example one in the Malayan

01:04:28.630 --> 01:04:31.660
peninsula-- what you find
is if you were saying

01:04:31.660 --> 01:04:35.430
my aunt, your mother, is a
completely different word then

01:04:35.430 --> 01:04:37.580
my aunt, your grandmother.

01:04:37.580 --> 01:04:40.100
It is not possible
to state a kinship

01:04:40.100 --> 01:04:43.670
word without it reflecting
also the person you're

01:04:43.670 --> 01:04:44.780
speaking with.

01:04:44.780 --> 01:04:48.850
You cannot talk about kinship
terms outside of the context

01:04:48.850 --> 01:04:52.880
of it being a conversation
and interaction much,

01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:57.380
much more indicative of
intertwined relations there.

01:04:57.380 --> 01:04:57.950
How is this?

01:04:57.950 --> 01:04:59.350
Here's another example.

01:04:59.350 --> 01:05:04.500
Here, you have in what would
be termed egocentric languages,

01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:07.630
like English, you refer
to directions with respect

01:05:07.630 --> 01:05:09.090
to your body.

01:05:09.090 --> 01:05:12.170
It's over there, you
say, indicating where it

01:05:12.170 --> 01:05:14.190
is with respect to your body.

01:05:14.190 --> 01:05:15.940
Where is that person standing?

01:05:15.940 --> 01:05:17.360
Just behind him.

01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:19.280
What you see in a lot
of other languages,

01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:22.050
less egocentric
ones, is directions

01:05:22.050 --> 01:05:26.040
are entirely a function
of external landmarks.

01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:28.120
And, thus, in a bunch
of aboriginal languages

01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:30.380
in Australia, you
can't say something

01:05:30.380 --> 01:05:33.190
like, oh, my right
foot is on fire.

01:05:33.190 --> 01:05:35.370
You can only say,
oh, my foot that's

01:05:35.370 --> 01:05:37.990
to the Northwest is on fire.

01:05:37.990 --> 01:05:42.710
The world is based by external
landmarks, rather than

01:05:42.710 --> 01:05:44.500
ones that are internal.

01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:47.630
Great example I heard
of this from [? Leah ?]

01:05:47.630 --> 01:05:50.325
[? Burdinksi-- ?] oh no, I
just mispronounced her name,

01:05:50.325 --> 01:05:50.980
I'm sure.

01:05:50.980 --> 01:05:53.563
And that's shameful, given that
it's a Russian name like mine.

01:05:53.563 --> 01:05:56.325
But in any case, in the
psychology department,

01:05:56.325 --> 01:05:58.380
and telling me this
great example that

01:05:58.380 --> 01:06:02.060
you get in some of these
non-ego language ones.

01:06:02.060 --> 01:06:06.760
OK, we tend to think of stories
going from left to right.

01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:09.390
If you give somebody
a bunch of tiles,

01:06:09.390 --> 01:06:12.140
which is part of frequent
IQ tests for kids,

01:06:12.140 --> 01:06:13.720
and they make a story.

01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:15.380
If you put them in
the right sequence,

01:06:15.380 --> 01:06:18.999
in English, what we do is we
put the first scene on the left.

01:06:18.999 --> 01:06:20.540
And it moves to the
right from there.

01:06:20.540 --> 01:06:23.680
Stories progress
from left to right.

01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:26.090
What you see in
these languages that

01:06:26.090 --> 01:06:31.390
are based by external cues,
is stories begin in the east,

01:06:31.390 --> 01:06:33.290
because that's
where the sun rises.

01:06:33.290 --> 01:06:35.880
So if you were
sitting facing south,

01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:37.530
and you were given
the tiles, you

01:06:37.530 --> 01:06:39.310
would put the story
starting over here,

01:06:39.310 --> 01:06:41.110
because that's where
the sun comes up.

01:06:41.110 --> 01:06:43.640
And if you were sitting,
instead, facing north,

01:06:43.640 --> 01:06:45.490
you would place
the tiles starting

01:06:45.490 --> 01:06:48.940
from the right to left, because
the only pertinent direction

01:06:48.940 --> 01:06:51.780
is nothing with respect
to where your body is,

01:06:51.780 --> 01:06:53.270
where your arms are.

01:06:53.270 --> 01:06:56.160
Directions, things,
start in the east.

01:06:56.160 --> 01:06:58.150
And that determines
things far more

01:06:58.150 --> 01:07:02.850
than your body's orientation--
classic, very non-ego-centered

01:07:02.850 --> 01:07:04.430
directionality in a language.

01:07:04.430 --> 01:07:06.680
So that is very frequent.

01:07:06.680 --> 01:07:09.390
So what begins to be
intrinsic in all of this

01:07:09.390 --> 01:07:13.040
is the notion that language
shapes the way you think.

01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:17.510
And this harks back to a grand
old theory in linguistics

01:07:17.510 --> 01:07:18.950
and language acquisition.

01:07:18.950 --> 01:07:23.450
And two guys, early in the
20th century, Sapir and Whorf.

01:07:23.450 --> 01:07:27.920
And the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis
being that language constrains

01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:30.900
thought, that your
capacity for thinking,

01:07:30.900 --> 01:07:34.310
the way in which you think,
is constrained by the language

01:07:34.310 --> 01:07:36.780
that you have been taught,
the language you speak.

01:07:36.780 --> 01:07:39.300
And that has been
debated endlessly

01:07:39.300 --> 01:07:41.580
in terms of just how
much evidence is there

01:07:41.580 --> 01:07:44.250
for that, versus how
much the style of thought

01:07:44.250 --> 01:07:45.640
shaped what the language is.

01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:47.620
This has endlessly been debated.

01:07:47.620 --> 01:07:51.750
And it's one of the hallmarks
of what linguistics is about.

01:07:51.750 --> 01:07:56.310
In the last decade, two
traditional populations

01:07:56.310 --> 01:07:58.630
in the Amazon that
were studied that

01:07:58.630 --> 01:08:01.600
are viewed as giving
really major support

01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:06.540
for a strict Sapir-Whorf notion
that your capacity for thought,

01:08:06.540 --> 01:08:11.130
the nature of your thought,
is deeply shaped, potentially

01:08:11.130 --> 01:08:13.760
deeply constrained, by language.

01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:16.800
So these two trials-- the
first is called the Paraha.

01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:21.279
And the other is called
the Murdruku, I believe.

01:08:21.279 --> 01:08:22.729
And what you have
in both of them

01:08:22.729 --> 01:08:26.100
is a very different number
system than we have,

01:08:26.100 --> 01:08:28.990
than virtually every
Western society does.

01:08:28.990 --> 01:08:32.350
In the first group, the
Paraha, their number system

01:08:32.350 --> 01:08:36.359
consists of three
numbers-- one, two,

01:08:36.359 --> 01:08:39.640
and something bigger than two.

01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:41.939
In Murdruku, it's
essentially the same thing.

01:08:41.939 --> 01:08:43.300
But it's five terms.

01:08:43.300 --> 01:08:47.840
It goes up to-- six terms, 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, and all other numbers

01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:49.779
that are bigger than five.

01:08:49.779 --> 01:08:51.779
And I don't know
completely what you

01:08:51.779 --> 01:08:54.729
suggests about how often you
have to count stuff down there.

01:08:54.729 --> 01:08:57.029
But what it suggests
is this is going

01:08:57.029 --> 01:08:59.380
to be a very different
relationship with numbers.

01:08:59.380 --> 01:09:02.229
And what they show,
studies with these folks,

01:09:02.229 --> 01:09:06.890
is doing mathematical
computations,

01:09:06.890 --> 01:09:08.450
doing estimates,
doing everything,

01:09:08.450 --> 01:09:11.729
in the second tribe
with numbers up to five,

01:09:11.729 --> 01:09:15.899
the exact same level of
accuracy as would a Westernized

01:09:15.899 --> 01:09:16.950
individual.

01:09:16.950 --> 01:09:20.930
But get above five, and
accuracy goes down the drain.

01:09:20.930 --> 01:09:26.020
Somebody in that society has a
huge amount of trouble telling

01:09:26.020 --> 01:09:27.890
the difference
between six objects

01:09:27.890 --> 01:09:30.724
and eight objects, eight
objects and 10 objects,

01:09:30.724 --> 01:09:34.040
because they all get bucketed
as, how many are there?

01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:36.970
It's the number that
means more than five.

01:09:36.970 --> 01:09:40.040
And in the first group, you
see the same exact thing

01:09:40.040 --> 01:09:42.130
for any number above three.

01:09:42.130 --> 01:09:45.700
There's a lot of trouble being
accurate distinguishing three,

01:09:45.700 --> 01:09:48.390
from four, from five, and
so on, because they all

01:09:48.390 --> 01:09:49.710
have the same term.

01:09:49.710 --> 01:09:52.920
They are that number
that is bigger than two.

01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:56.190
All of that occurring once
you get above those numbers,

01:09:56.190 --> 01:09:59.540
guesses essentially
at the chance level.

01:09:59.540 --> 01:10:02.770
So that's kind of impressive,
and very interesting.

01:10:02.770 --> 01:10:07.230
But maybe there's always
this potential counter

01:10:07.230 --> 01:10:09.160
interpretation as to
what's happening there,

01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:13.010
which is maybe these are not
terribly sharp folks there,

01:10:13.010 --> 01:10:15.070
and maybe have had
all sorts of issues

01:10:15.070 --> 01:10:18.536
with protein malnutrition,
or cerebral malaria,

01:10:18.536 --> 01:10:19.610
or God knows what.

01:10:19.610 --> 01:10:22.680
No, because in each of
these populations, each

01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:25.300
of these cultures,
they know thousands

01:10:25.300 --> 01:10:28.870
of different types of edible
plants and medicinal plants.

01:10:28.870 --> 01:10:31.840
These are enormously
sophisticated people

01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:33.110
in those realms.

01:10:33.110 --> 01:10:35.640
Numbers just aren't a big deal.

01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:39.030
And what you see is somebody
growing up in that society who

01:10:39.030 --> 01:10:42.840
has not invented the language,
but are instead acquiring it,

01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:45.184
it constrains their
ability to tell

01:10:45.184 --> 01:10:46.600
the difference
between the numbers

01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:51.460
three and four-- very
shaping in that regard.

01:10:51.460 --> 01:10:54.250
So all sorts of people
debating endlessly

01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:56.950
how much does language
shape the way you think?

01:10:56.950 --> 01:10:59.220
How much does thinking
shape the sort of language

01:10:59.220 --> 01:11:00.170
you come up with?

01:11:00.170 --> 01:11:01.950
But at the end of
the day, there's

01:11:01.950 --> 01:11:04.690
this whole
philosophical business

01:11:04.690 --> 01:11:07.900
that no matter how similar
the language is that you're

01:11:07.900 --> 01:11:10.800
using with someone else,
it's going to mean something

01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:12.190
slightly different to you.

01:11:12.190 --> 01:11:15.780
And, thus, you have the flipside
to our ethology sound bite.

01:11:15.780 --> 01:11:17.300
Ethology is
interviewing the animal,

01:11:17.300 --> 01:11:18.750
but it's its own language.

01:11:18.750 --> 01:11:20.960
Sort of the flip side, a
quote once to the effect

01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:24.047
of, if you could interview
a lion in its own language,

01:11:24.047 --> 01:11:25.880
you wouldn't have a
clue what it was talking

01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:30.632
about because communication
is so intertwined with mind,

01:11:30.632 --> 01:11:33.940
with values, with meaning,
all of that, that it would

01:11:33.940 --> 01:11:35.770
essentially be inaccessible.

01:11:35.770 --> 01:11:39.160
And you hear about people
who are multilingual.

01:11:39.160 --> 01:11:43.480
How many of you are pretty
adept at a second language?

01:11:43.480 --> 01:11:46.540
Third language?

01:11:46.540 --> 01:11:47.850
Any hands up there?

01:11:47.850 --> 01:11:49.490
Whoa, OK.

01:11:49.490 --> 01:11:51.450
So those of you who
are really comfortable

01:11:51.450 --> 01:11:54.200
in multiple
languages, do you find

01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:56.240
you have different
emotional emotive

01:11:56.240 --> 01:11:59.680
styles of communicating when
you're switching languages?

01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:03.500
Do you tend to have more
expressivity in one of them?

01:12:03.500 --> 01:12:07.180
Do you tend to be more
analytical, whatever?

01:12:07.180 --> 01:12:09.420
OK, I'm going to pretend
that there was just

01:12:09.420 --> 01:12:12.480
hundreds of faces going up and
down agreeing with that stance,

01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:14.360
because that's a
well-known fact based

01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:16.585
on years of teaching BIO150.

01:12:16.585 --> 01:12:18.970
Yeah, languages
serve different ,

01:12:18.970 --> 01:12:20.760
functions and
different emotions,

01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:23.350
and different cognitions,
very intertwined.

01:12:23.350 --> 01:12:26.430
And at a true extreme,
interviewing somebody

01:12:26.430 --> 01:12:29.720
in their own language, even
if it is the same language

01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:31.570
that you ostensibly
share with them,

01:12:31.570 --> 01:12:35.310
you're not quite going to be
speaking the same language.

01:12:35.310 --> 01:12:38.880
Shifting now over to animals--
animal communication,

01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:40.790
and in what ways
is it completely

01:12:40.790 --> 01:12:42.310
distinct from what we do?

01:12:42.310 --> 01:12:44.460
And in what ways are
there major overlaps?

01:12:44.460 --> 01:12:46.540
It's going to be the
same sort of themes

01:12:46.540 --> 01:12:48.810
as with the sex lectures,
the aggression lectures,

01:12:48.810 --> 01:12:51.540
all sorts of things that
people used to think

01:12:51.540 --> 01:12:55.510
were unique to humans
turn out to be less so.

01:12:55.510 --> 01:12:58.730
For example, other species
show the building blocks

01:12:58.730 --> 01:13:00.450
of semanticity.

01:13:00.450 --> 01:13:05.480
Semanticity, the fact
that a discrete sound

01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:09.750
can have meaning, and meaning
distinctive enough that it

01:13:09.750 --> 01:13:11.810
is separate from emotion.

01:13:11.810 --> 01:13:13.280
We've already heard
a great example

01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:14.930
of this with the
vervet monkeys who

01:13:14.930 --> 01:13:17.950
could tell the difference
between a vocalization saying,

01:13:17.950 --> 01:13:20.400
something scary up
in the air, get down,

01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:23.560
and something scary down on
the ground, get up in the tree.

01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:27.060
These are in common in terms
of the emotional content.

01:13:27.060 --> 01:13:30.880
But in terms of the semanticity,
the factual information

01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:33.650
transmitted, they're
diametrically opposite.

01:13:33.650 --> 01:13:35.490
This is what a word is.

01:13:35.490 --> 01:13:37.790
It is communicating
a stable concept

01:13:37.790 --> 01:13:39.880
that is independent of emotion.

01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:42.970
Vervet monkeys have
the starts of that.

01:13:42.970 --> 01:13:45.770
It turns out chickens
do that as well.

01:13:45.770 --> 01:13:48.600
I have no idea what
chickens emote about.

01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:51.040
But they have
different types of ones

01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:53.420
that communicate
information about what

01:13:53.420 --> 01:13:56.360
they are being menaced
by-- again, predator stuff.

01:13:56.360 --> 01:14:01.340
Vervets, not only do they have
a vocalization for scary raptor

01:14:01.340 --> 01:14:04.130
up in the sky versus scary
snake down on the ground,

01:14:04.130 --> 01:14:06.880
but they have two
vocalizations for one of them.

01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:09.880
And I forget which,
they have a synonym.

01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:12.760
They have the building
blocks of synonyms.

01:14:12.760 --> 01:14:14.080
What else?

01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:16.380
Animals and their
communication systems

01:14:16.380 --> 01:14:18.170
somehow have
incorporated the fact

01:14:18.170 --> 01:14:21.620
that facial expressions
and auditory communication

01:14:21.620 --> 01:14:23.060
go hand in hand.

01:14:23.060 --> 01:14:24.440
How can you show this?

01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:25.920
Take a rhesus monkey.

01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:28.820
And show it a film clip
of another monkey making

01:14:28.820 --> 01:14:31.220
some vocalization with
the facial expression

01:14:31.220 --> 01:14:33.900
over and over, and then
some other facial expression

01:14:33.900 --> 01:14:37.000
and emotion where they tend
to go together vocalization.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:40.450
Now pop one up there where
the monkey that is watching

01:14:40.450 --> 01:14:43.630
is giving an alarm
vocalization, and a come

01:14:43.630 --> 01:14:45.790
groom me sort of smiley face.

01:14:45.790 --> 01:14:48.920
And the monkey is
immediately oriented.

01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:50.280
And heart rate increases.

01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:53.120
It knows that facial
expression doesn't

01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:55.160
go with that vocalization.

01:14:55.160 --> 01:14:59.370
It's incorporated multi-modal
pathways of communication

01:14:59.370 --> 01:15:00.607
like that.

01:15:00.607 --> 01:15:02.190
Something else that
used to be thought

01:15:02.190 --> 01:15:05.010
to be unique to
humans-- intentionality

01:15:05.010 --> 01:15:06.590
of communication.

01:15:06.590 --> 01:15:10.370
I am making this sound not
because I am terrified,

01:15:10.370 --> 01:15:13.360
because I am happy, because
I am hungry, whatever,

01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:16.050
where I would be making
that regardless of who else

01:15:16.050 --> 01:15:16.940
is around.

01:15:16.940 --> 01:15:19.700
I am going to communicate
something only

01:15:19.700 --> 01:15:24.110
if this person is around, but
not that one-- intentionality.

01:15:24.110 --> 01:15:27.990
And it turns out, you find
that in other species as well.

01:15:27.990 --> 01:15:30.610
You see that in
vervets, for example.

01:15:30.610 --> 01:15:33.520
Vervets will give alarm
calls much more readily

01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:35.770
when their relatives
are around, then when

01:15:35.770 --> 01:15:37.490
non-relatives are around.

01:15:37.490 --> 01:15:40.920
Squirrels will do the same
thing with alarm calls.

01:15:40.920 --> 01:15:43.500
And if squirrels have been
having aggressive interactions

01:15:43.500 --> 01:15:45.070
with some other
squirrel, they are

01:15:45.070 --> 01:15:48.610
less likely to give an alarm
call when a predator is around

01:15:48.610 --> 01:15:50.540
than if it was
somebody they liked.

01:15:50.540 --> 01:15:53.220
There is intentionality
in that realm.

01:15:53.220 --> 01:15:56.320
What's implicit in that,
at least some proto

01:15:56.320 --> 01:16:00.380
building block steps
of theory of mind.

01:16:00.380 --> 01:16:01.240
So what else?

01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:03.950
What things remain
unique in human language?

01:16:03.950 --> 01:16:06.834
Dramatic displacement--
that ability

01:16:06.834 --> 01:16:09.000
to talk about things on the
other side of the globe,

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.333
and things that never happened,
and imaginary whatevers,

01:16:11.333 --> 01:16:13.350
and philosophy,
the arbitrariness,

01:16:13.350 --> 01:16:15.960
the embedded clauses,
the recursiveness.

01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:19.000
And a very important thing
about human language,

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:22.360
pretty uniquely--
the capacity to lie.

01:16:22.360 --> 01:16:25.400
And that has to do
with the arbitrariness.

01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:26.520
You are human.

01:16:26.520 --> 01:16:29.440
And you are in some
confrontational situation.

01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:31.750
And you are terrified
out of your wits.

01:16:31.750 --> 01:16:34.440
And the last thing you
would do is say, oh my,

01:16:34.440 --> 01:16:36.627
I am terrified out of my
wits, because you do not

01:16:36.627 --> 01:16:38.210
want to have the
other individual know

01:16:38.210 --> 01:16:39.420
that you are terrified.

01:16:39.420 --> 01:16:40.610
What do you do?

01:16:40.610 --> 01:16:46.520
You suppress the expression of
emotionally revealing language.

01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:50.910
Or you can even do something
like start chest thumping,

01:16:50.910 --> 01:16:54.180
and say all sorts of things
implying anything but fear--

01:16:54.180 --> 01:16:58.230
and, in fact, sort of
bullying pugnacity.

01:16:58.230 --> 01:17:00.890
And they're you're
lying as well.

01:17:00.890 --> 01:17:03.450
Humans have the
capacity to do that.

01:17:03.450 --> 01:17:06.930
A dog who is terrified
is going to be terrified.

01:17:06.930 --> 01:17:09.140
An animal that has
a strong emotion

01:17:09.140 --> 01:17:12.250
is going to give off pheromonal
signals, for example,

01:17:12.250 --> 01:17:15.210
depending on the species, that
communicates it, no matter

01:17:15.210 --> 01:17:16.960
how much that is
not the thing they

01:17:16.960 --> 01:17:18.620
want to be doing at the time.

01:17:18.620 --> 01:17:20.910
And here's a great
example of it.

01:17:20.910 --> 01:17:23.140
You take a dog,
one that's scared.

01:17:23.140 --> 01:17:24.937
And it doesn't want to
let an opponent know

01:17:24.937 --> 01:17:27.020
that it's scared if this
is some sort of dominance

01:17:27.020 --> 01:17:28.000
confrontation.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:29.580
And what it's doing
if it's scared

01:17:29.580 --> 01:17:33.300
is it's pumping out scared
pheromones-- pheromones

01:17:33.300 --> 01:17:36.190
with high levels of breakdown
products, of stress hormones.

01:17:36.190 --> 01:17:37.240
We know this already.

01:17:37.240 --> 01:17:38.390
It's pumping them out.

01:17:38.390 --> 01:17:40.650
And that's the last thing
it wants to be doing.

01:17:40.650 --> 01:17:43.780
It would love to be able
to lie and say, no, I'm

01:17:43.780 --> 01:17:44.820
not scared at all.

01:17:44.820 --> 01:17:47.340
But it can't do it
because there is not

01:17:47.340 --> 01:17:51.470
an arbitrary relationship
between being scared

01:17:51.470 --> 01:17:52.830
and how it's communicated.

01:17:52.830 --> 01:17:54.450
They are intertwined.

01:17:54.450 --> 01:17:58.240
The same phenomenon of the
scaredness is the signal of it.

01:17:58.240 --> 01:18:01.050
They can't prevent the
pheromones from coming out,

01:18:01.050 --> 01:18:02.700
in terms of shutting
down the glands.

01:18:02.700 --> 01:18:05.680
So what does a dog
do when it's scared

01:18:05.680 --> 01:18:08.360
and it's giving off all
these scared pheromones

01:18:08.360 --> 01:18:09.690
from its anal glands?

01:18:09.690 --> 01:18:12.040
It tries to shut
down the glands.

01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:14.660
It tucks its tail
between its legs.

01:18:14.660 --> 01:18:17.480
It tries to cover up
the pheromone release.

01:18:17.480 --> 01:18:19.570
And what does a dog
do when its perfectly

01:18:19.570 --> 01:18:22.670
content, and perfectly willing
to let the rest of the world

01:18:22.670 --> 01:18:24.270
know how its feeling
about things?

01:18:24.270 --> 01:18:26.980
It wants to spread those
pheromones around it.

01:18:26.980 --> 01:18:28.750
It rags its tail.

01:18:28.750 --> 01:18:30.240
Dogs can't lie.

01:18:30.240 --> 01:18:33.204
All they can do is try to put
their hand over their mouth.

01:18:33.204 --> 01:18:35.120
When they're about to
say something revealing,

01:18:35.120 --> 01:18:37.380
they tuck their tail
between their legs.

01:18:37.380 --> 01:18:41.930
So humans retain
this capacity to lie.

01:18:41.930 --> 01:18:44.745
Now, in terms of other
species and what they can do,

01:18:44.745 --> 01:18:49.540
what we transition to is a
really interesting subfield

01:18:49.540 --> 01:18:51.720
of this whole subject,
which is attempts

01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:55.020
to teach human languages
to other species--

01:18:55.020 --> 01:18:57.780
attempts to teach language
to other primates.

01:18:57.780 --> 01:19:00.430
And that has a long
and storied past,

01:19:00.430 --> 01:19:02.840
with all sorts of
disastrous outcomes

01:19:02.840 --> 01:19:06.140
and huge controversies
getting at this issue of,

01:19:06.140 --> 01:19:08.810
what sort of cognitive
aspects of language

01:19:08.810 --> 01:19:11.280
do we potentially share
with another species?

01:19:11.280 --> 01:19:13.715
OK, all of this has
been with chimps

01:19:13.715 --> 01:19:15.940
up until the last
20 years or so.

01:19:15.940 --> 01:19:19.270
And it started off
with a poor chimp

01:19:19.270 --> 01:19:23.500
named Vicki who belonged to send
researchers back in the 1930s.

01:19:23.500 --> 01:19:25.100
And I forget who and where.

01:19:25.100 --> 01:19:27.120
And what they
decided was they were

01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:32.130
going to teach Vicki to
speak English, naturally,

01:19:32.130 --> 01:19:33.066
and to speak.

01:19:33.066 --> 01:19:34.440
And how were they
going to do it?

01:19:34.440 --> 01:19:38.210
Using the then cutting edge,
just emerging principles

01:19:38.210 --> 01:19:41.850
of behaviorism, Vicki was
subject to behaviorist rules.

01:19:41.850 --> 01:19:44.630
If she wanted water,
she would have

01:19:44.630 --> 01:19:46.950
to make a sound
that vaguely sort of

01:19:46.950 --> 01:19:49.190
sounded like the word cup.

01:19:49.190 --> 01:19:53.150
She'd have to make this sort of
exhaling, barky sort of thing,

01:19:53.150 --> 01:19:56.070
which if your imagination
really ran away with you,

01:19:56.070 --> 01:19:57.820
would sound like the word cup.

01:19:57.820 --> 01:20:00.230
There were a few other
one syllable words

01:20:00.230 --> 01:20:02.030
were they wouldn't
feed her unless she

01:20:02.030 --> 01:20:05.580
made whatever sound they said
was close to the word food.

01:20:05.580 --> 01:20:09.190
This was one screwed
up chimp, in terms

01:20:09.190 --> 01:20:10.650
of seeing films of this chimp.

01:20:10.650 --> 01:20:13.760
This was one incredibly
neurotic animal.

01:20:13.760 --> 01:20:16.120
And thank God, after
only a few years,

01:20:16.120 --> 01:20:19.060
the researchers decided, you
know, this isn't working.

01:20:19.060 --> 01:20:20.900
And this poor animal
was allowed not to have

01:20:20.900 --> 01:20:22.630
to go through this anymore.

01:20:22.630 --> 01:20:24.790
Oh, this doesn't work.

01:20:24.790 --> 01:20:28.350
Soon after that, there
was another chimp

01:20:28.350 --> 01:20:30.430
that had one of these
sorts of upbringings.

01:20:30.430 --> 01:20:33.470
And this was raised by a
psychologist named Kellogg

01:20:33.470 --> 01:20:35.220
at, I believe, Yale.

01:20:35.220 --> 01:20:37.460
And what this person
was oriented to

01:20:37.460 --> 01:20:41.290
was Judith Rich Harris'
work on peer influences,

01:20:41.290 --> 01:20:44.580
even though she wasn't born yet,
the notion of peer influences.

01:20:44.580 --> 01:20:47.180
Why couldn't Vicki
learn English?

01:20:47.180 --> 01:20:49.780
Because she didn't have a peer.

01:20:49.780 --> 01:20:52.330
You need to have a chimp
grow up with a human.

01:20:52.330 --> 01:20:53.790
The two of them
growing up together

01:20:53.790 --> 01:20:56.500
with the exact same
environment and same treatment,

01:20:56.500 --> 01:20:59.840
and the human who's really
good at acquiring language,

01:20:59.840 --> 01:21:01.430
the chimp then will
have a peer, will

01:21:01.430 --> 01:21:03.804
have a role model, all of
that, and we'll pick up English

01:21:03.804 --> 01:21:04.540
as well.

01:21:04.540 --> 01:21:08.650
And, thus, the Kelloggs
raised their child, Donald.

01:21:08.650 --> 01:21:11.000
Donald was raised
with this chimp.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:12.610
And I'm forgetting
the chimp's name.

01:21:12.610 --> 01:21:16.580
But Donald fared almost
as poorly as Vicki.

01:21:16.580 --> 01:21:20.790
And they did this whole
study on the acquisition,

01:21:20.790 --> 01:21:23.200
and studies of the two,
and these whole books

01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:26.439
written about Donald and
his chimp brother there.

01:21:26.439 --> 01:21:27.980
And what was supposed
to be happening

01:21:27.980 --> 01:21:31.166
was the chimp was going to
learn English from Donald.

01:21:31.166 --> 01:21:32.540
And what you saw
developmentally,

01:21:32.540 --> 01:21:35.310
the chimp, of course,
was miles ahead of him.

01:21:35.310 --> 01:21:38.710
The chimp was climbing trees
while Donald was still cruising

01:21:38.710 --> 01:21:40.980
on the couch kind of thing.

01:21:40.980 --> 01:21:45.090
But in terms of language stuff,
it never went that direction.

01:21:45.090 --> 01:21:47.640
What wound up
happening was Donald

01:21:47.640 --> 01:21:51.040
started making vocalizations
of the chimp, at which point

01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:53.320
his parents stopped
the experiment.

01:21:53.320 --> 01:21:55.092
But this was totally nutty.

01:21:55.092 --> 01:21:56.550
They were doing
things-- like, they

01:21:56.550 --> 01:22:00.030
did this experiment on auditory
acuity in the two of them.

01:22:00.030 --> 01:22:01.750
You could see this in the book.

01:22:01.750 --> 01:22:02.590
They filmed them.

01:22:02.590 --> 01:22:05.780
There's Donald, and I believe
the chimp's name was Gua.

01:22:05.780 --> 01:22:08.070
And the two of them were
sitting there being perfectly

01:22:08.070 --> 01:22:09.430
happy sitting on the lawn.

01:22:09.430 --> 01:22:11.790
And they're were being
filmed, high speed film.

01:22:11.790 --> 01:22:13.940
And what does the
damn father do?

01:22:13.940 --> 01:22:17.350
He sneaks up behind them
with a starter's pistol

01:22:17.350 --> 01:22:21.580
and shoots it so that they can
get on film which one of them

01:22:21.580 --> 01:22:24.800
has the faster reaction time of
being scared out of their wits

01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:27.630
by their father shooting
this thing behind them.

01:22:27.630 --> 01:22:29.100
And what do you know?

01:22:29.100 --> 01:22:31.960
Gua had slightly faster
panic reaction stuff.

01:22:31.960 --> 01:22:35.620
So this was something that,
fortunately, hit a wall.

01:22:35.620 --> 01:22:40.900
And Donald, I believe, wound up
having a very interesting life.

01:22:40.900 --> 01:22:43.720
And I don't think it
was urban legends.

01:22:43.720 --> 01:22:44.970
I wish I remembered.

01:22:44.970 --> 01:22:46.620
But it made perfect
sense, given what

01:22:46.620 --> 01:22:48.580
a bizarre childhood he had.

01:22:48.580 --> 01:22:52.880
OK, soon people realized
they, or not so soon, then

01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:55.530
in the 1960s some
researchers finally

01:22:55.530 --> 01:22:57.760
realized what the
problem was with this,

01:22:57.760 --> 01:23:01.530
which is it is absurd thinking
that a chimp is going to learn

01:23:01.530 --> 01:23:05.340
how to speak a language
because they simply do not

01:23:05.340 --> 01:23:07.870
have the larynx that can do it.

01:23:07.870 --> 01:23:10.560
They do not have the
larynx that could produce

01:23:10.560 --> 01:23:12.080
discrete sounds like that.

01:23:12.080 --> 01:23:13.209
It's impossible.

01:23:13.209 --> 01:23:14.750
Not because they're
not smart enough,

01:23:14.750 --> 01:23:17.620
but they simply don't
have the anatomy to do it.

01:23:17.620 --> 01:23:19.820
And, thus, this was
a couple, University

01:23:19.820 --> 01:23:23.090
of Nevada named the
Gardeners, who came up

01:23:23.090 --> 01:23:27.190
with the brilliantly creative
idea of teaching a chimp

01:23:27.190 --> 01:23:32.090
American Sign Language to
bypass the vocal limitations,

01:23:32.090 --> 01:23:33.430
and just get at a system.

01:23:33.430 --> 01:23:35.890
Chimps have great
manual dexterity.

01:23:35.890 --> 01:23:38.240
Tap at the cognitive
aspects of language.

01:23:38.240 --> 01:23:41.280
Bypass the sound
vocals business.

01:23:41.280 --> 01:23:43.750
And, thus, came the
first sign language

01:23:43.750 --> 01:23:46.870
ape, a chimp named Washoe.

01:23:46.870 --> 01:23:51.650
Washoe was the
darling of linguists,

01:23:51.650 --> 01:23:54.640
psycholinguists a while,
because there was something so,

01:23:54.640 --> 01:23:57.730
so cool about a chimpanzee
sitting there being

01:23:57.730 --> 01:23:59.990
able to sign in sign language.

01:23:59.990 --> 01:24:03.130
Washoe, by the time she was
about a half dozen years old,

01:24:03.130 --> 01:24:06.500
had acquired about 150
different signs in English.

01:24:06.500 --> 01:24:09.020
And she could communicate
with the Gardeners with it.

01:24:09.020 --> 01:24:12.770
And people were producing
these glowing sorts

01:24:12.770 --> 01:24:14.770
of articles about them.

01:24:14.770 --> 01:24:16.940
I remember this one
guy, a science writer,

01:24:16.940 --> 01:24:20.380
who happened to
have deaf parents.

01:24:20.380 --> 01:24:23.440
So he was raised bilingual with
both English and American Sign

01:24:23.440 --> 01:24:24.050
Language.

01:24:24.050 --> 01:24:26.890
And this article about
going to visit Washoe,

01:24:26.890 --> 01:24:29.970
and the bizarrity of
speaking to a chimpanzee

01:24:29.970 --> 01:24:31.440
in his native language.

01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:33.280
And how cool is that?

01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:37.100
And Washoe was being
reported to do a hallmark

01:24:37.100 --> 01:24:38.920
feature of language
use, which is

01:24:38.920 --> 01:24:43.730
to begin to invent words,
where she combined the word

01:24:43.730 --> 01:24:46.440
water and the sign
language for bird,

01:24:46.440 --> 01:24:48.310
put them together,
to water bird.

01:24:48.310 --> 01:24:50.360
And that's what
she called ducks.

01:24:50.360 --> 01:24:51.100
Oh my God.

01:24:51.100 --> 01:24:52.990
She's made a new term.

01:24:52.990 --> 01:24:54.160
She babbled.

01:24:54.160 --> 01:24:57.310
Before going to sleep, she
would do her favorite signs

01:24:57.310 --> 01:24:59.990
to herself, and babble
herself to sleep.

01:24:59.990 --> 01:25:04.831
She used sign language to lie,
and to do all sorts of stuff

01:25:04.831 --> 01:25:06.080
she shouldn't have been doing.

01:25:06.080 --> 01:25:09.860
And Washoe lived in this
trailer on the campus there.

01:25:09.860 --> 01:25:13.567
And they often had this video
camera up at night filming her.

01:25:13.567 --> 01:25:15.150
And they would have
a low light there.

01:25:15.150 --> 01:25:18.010
And every now and then
you would see things like,

01:25:18.010 --> 01:25:19.740
there was a refrigerator there.

01:25:19.740 --> 01:25:22.740
And Washoe was not supposed
to open up the refrigerator

01:25:22.740 --> 01:25:24.390
and steal food out
of it at night.

01:25:24.390 --> 01:25:26.120
And, suddenly, the
camera is there.

01:25:26.120 --> 01:25:28.600
And the trailer is
absolutely quiet and empty.

01:25:28.600 --> 01:25:32.370
And, suddenly, you see Washoe
walking across, signing,

01:25:32.370 --> 01:25:36.710
saying, quiet, Washoe,
quiet, Washoe, and raiding

01:25:36.710 --> 01:25:40.680
the refrigerator that
way-- totally cool stuff.

01:25:40.680 --> 01:25:43.570
They brought in a second
chimp, a second chimp,

01:25:43.570 --> 01:25:46.830
to have Washoe and the chimp
start learning sign language,

01:25:46.830 --> 01:25:48.360
and start talking to each other.

01:25:48.360 --> 01:25:50.010
And a couple of
months into it, they

01:25:50.010 --> 01:25:52.350
had the first conversation
in sign language

01:25:52.350 --> 01:25:54.660
ever by another species.

01:25:54.660 --> 01:25:56.820
The two chimps were
sitting there, and facing

01:25:56.820 --> 01:25:58.310
in opposite directions.

01:25:58.310 --> 01:26:01.830
And they both made use of what
in every one of these projects

01:26:01.830 --> 01:26:04.800
was the first word that
any chimp ever mastered,

01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:08.810
which was tickle, because
chimps love to be tickled.

01:26:08.810 --> 01:26:10.830
And the first sentence
they ever mastered

01:26:10.830 --> 01:26:14.220
would always be
tickle me, tickle me.

01:26:14.220 --> 01:26:17.920
So there's the two of them,
sitting Washoe and Bowie

01:26:17.920 --> 01:26:19.300
I believe his name was.

01:26:19.300 --> 01:26:23.850
And Washoe says, tickle me.

01:26:23.850 --> 01:26:26.540
And Bowie says, tickle me.

01:26:26.540 --> 01:26:30.000
And Washoe, tickle
me, me, me, me, me.

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.060
And Bowie says, tickle
me, tickle me, tickle me.

01:26:32.060 --> 01:26:34.130
And, finally, the two of
them get up and walk off

01:26:34.130 --> 01:26:35.700
in opposite directions.

01:26:35.700 --> 01:26:39.300
There you have failed detente
in the very first conversation

01:26:39.300 --> 01:26:39.800
there.

01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:42.700
So my God, they're even
talking to each other.

01:26:42.700 --> 01:26:45.260
This is totally cool.

01:26:45.260 --> 01:26:47.860
Meanwhile, a guy at the
University of Pennsylvania

01:26:47.860 --> 01:26:51.000
named David Premack had
his chimp named Sarah.

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:54.120
And he was very irritated
about the imprecision

01:26:54.120 --> 01:26:55.280
of sign language.

01:26:55.280 --> 01:27:00.940
He was teaching Sarah
a symbolic language

01:27:00.940 --> 01:27:03.570
pattern of different
shaped magnetic tiles,

01:27:03.570 --> 01:27:07.920
and showing very rigorously
that Sarah could do if-then type

01:27:07.920 --> 01:27:11.020
clauses, could begin
to do embedded clauses,

01:27:11.020 --> 01:27:13.430
saying things like,
he would put up

01:27:13.430 --> 01:27:18.810
the sign saying, if the
red ball is in the bucket,

01:27:18.810 --> 01:27:24.120
go hoot crazily in joy.

01:27:24.120 --> 01:27:26.490
And Sarah would be
able to do this, and be

01:27:26.490 --> 01:27:29.860
able to construct these as
well-- nothing very much

01:27:29.860 --> 01:27:31.640
resembling the
fluidity of language,

01:27:31.640 --> 01:27:36.220
but nonetheless showing really
sophisticated structure to it.

01:27:36.220 --> 01:27:38.010
So these guys were
rolling along.

01:27:38.010 --> 01:27:39.810
And everybody loved this.

01:27:39.810 --> 01:27:41.970
And this was the
greatest stuff ever,

01:27:41.970 --> 01:27:44.680
chimps speaking
American Sign Language.

01:27:44.680 --> 01:27:48.530
And you could hang out
with them, and tickle them.

01:27:48.530 --> 01:27:51.140
And they'd never tickle
you back, apparently.

01:27:51.140 --> 01:27:55.210
But showing interviewing an
animal in its own language,

01:27:55.210 --> 01:27:58.640
none of that reciprocity of
tickling stuff with a human.

01:27:58.640 --> 01:28:01.940
But then, then,
along came the ape

01:28:01.940 --> 01:28:04.230
to end all apes
when it came to sign

01:28:04.230 --> 01:28:08.340
language, Koko,
Koko the gorilla.

01:28:08.340 --> 01:28:12.830
Koko the gorilla started off her
linguistic life here on campus.

01:28:12.830 --> 01:28:16.250
Koko was originally a gorilla
up in the San Francisco Zoo.

01:28:16.250 --> 01:28:19.980
And a graduate student, by
now I can't remember how

01:28:19.980 --> 01:28:22.990
many decades ago, named Penny
Patterson in the psychology

01:28:22.990 --> 01:28:25.770
department decided that
for a bunch of reasons

01:28:25.770 --> 01:28:28.280
gorillas were going to
be a lot more focused.

01:28:28.280 --> 01:28:31.515
Compared to gorillas,
chimps all have ADD.

01:28:31.515 --> 01:28:33.390
And Koko was going
to be the one.

01:28:33.390 --> 01:28:35.310
And she managed to
get a loan of Koko

01:28:35.310 --> 01:28:37.660
from the San Francisco Zoo.

01:28:37.660 --> 01:28:41.130
And apparently during that
era, like half the days

01:28:41.130 --> 01:28:42.880
you could be going
around campus and there

01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:45.540
would be Koko going by
on a bicycle with Penny

01:28:45.540 --> 01:28:47.305
Patterson or some such thing.

01:28:47.305 --> 01:28:51.110
So Koko is this baby growing up
here on campus, totally cool.

01:28:51.110 --> 01:28:54.240
Koko begins to learn
American Sign Language.

01:28:54.240 --> 01:28:58.510
And that was clear was this
was the ape of all time when

01:28:58.510 --> 01:29:00.650
it came to learning
American Sign Language.

01:29:00.650 --> 01:29:02.600
Koko was amazing.

01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:04.480
Koko was learning stuff.

01:29:04.480 --> 01:29:07.130
Patterson was reporting the
most astonishing things.

01:29:07.130 --> 01:29:09.900
Koko could report dreams.

01:29:09.900 --> 01:29:12.440
Koko could gossip,
could gossip as

01:29:12.440 --> 01:29:14.810
in there would be two
people on the project

01:29:14.810 --> 01:29:17.900
who, like, had a fight in
front of her in the morning.

01:29:17.900 --> 01:29:21.430
And later in the day, she could
tell one of the other humans

01:29:21.430 --> 01:29:25.390
that the two of them were having
some fight thing or whatever.

01:29:25.390 --> 01:29:28.840
Koko could gossip in
American Sign Language.

01:29:28.840 --> 01:29:30.550
Koko could do anything.

01:29:30.550 --> 01:29:33.300
Koko could philosophize.

01:29:33.300 --> 01:29:36.840
Koko could lie like
crazy, of course,

01:29:36.840 --> 01:29:38.560
because all of these
chimps and apes

01:29:38.560 --> 01:29:40.370
immediately began
lying like crazy.

01:29:40.370 --> 01:29:42.840
Here's one of the things
she was reported as doing.

01:29:42.840 --> 01:29:44.690
So Koko is left
alone in this room.

01:29:44.690 --> 01:29:47.940
And there's a
potted plant there.

01:29:47.940 --> 01:29:49.090
And nobody's around.

01:29:49.090 --> 01:29:50.910
And Koko being a gorilla,
what does she do?

01:29:50.910 --> 01:29:51.570
She looks around.

01:29:51.570 --> 01:29:52.445
There's nobody there.

01:29:52.445 --> 01:29:54.520
So she eats the plant.

01:29:54.520 --> 01:29:58.190
So after a while, in
comes Patterson, and says,

01:29:58.190 --> 01:30:00.620
what happened, in sign
language, to the plant?

01:30:00.620 --> 01:30:02.050
Where's the plant?

01:30:02.050 --> 01:30:05.240
And Koko, who has
been caught red-handed

01:30:05.240 --> 01:30:09.220
here, Koko says, Bill ate it.

01:30:09.220 --> 01:30:11.910
Bill, the poor bastard grad
student on the project,

01:30:11.910 --> 01:30:13.850
oh, blame the grad student.

01:30:13.850 --> 01:30:17.980
So Patterson says,
don't tell me that.

01:30:17.980 --> 01:30:18.990
Bill's not a gorilla.

01:30:18.990 --> 01:30:20.640
Humans don't eat plants.

01:30:20.640 --> 01:30:22.240
Gorillas only eat plants.

01:30:22.240 --> 01:30:27.130
And Koko sits there and
says, some other gorilla,

01:30:27.130 --> 01:30:28.710
some other gorilla.

01:30:28.710 --> 01:30:30.210
So this was amazing.

01:30:30.210 --> 01:30:31.940
Koko was just the best.

01:30:31.940 --> 01:30:37.950
So, suddenly, Koko was like
double dating with Madonna,

01:30:37.950 --> 01:30:42.020
and endorsing [INAUDIBLE],
and aerobic exercises,

01:30:42.020 --> 01:30:44.620
and the Koko diet, and
things of that sort.

01:30:44.620 --> 01:30:45.990
And it was totally great.

01:30:45.990 --> 01:30:48.610
And this was the
best gorilla ever.

01:30:48.610 --> 01:30:50.080
And this was the best ape.

01:30:50.080 --> 01:30:52.020
And they brought
in this male who

01:30:52.020 --> 01:30:54.200
was supposed to,
like, knock up Koko

01:30:54.200 --> 01:30:56.820
so that she could have a
baby and teach her baby sign

01:30:56.820 --> 01:30:59.840
language, a multi-generational
gorilla teaching

01:30:59.840 --> 01:31:01.440
philosophy to their children.

01:31:01.440 --> 01:31:02.840
And all of this was great.

01:31:02.840 --> 01:31:07.540
And then around 1980
all of it got ruined.

01:31:07.540 --> 01:31:12.130
And it got ruined by a guy at
Columbia named Herb Terrace.

01:31:12.130 --> 01:31:14.890
Terrace had been another
one of the ones starting

01:31:14.890 --> 01:31:18.020
one of the sign
language chimp projects.

01:31:18.020 --> 01:31:20.820
And he started with
a chimp who was

01:31:20.820 --> 01:31:24.770
going to disprove Noam Chomsky,
who argued that there was

01:31:24.770 --> 01:31:27.390
no way anything that these
chimps and gorillas could do

01:31:27.390 --> 01:31:29.350
would actually
count as language.

01:31:29.350 --> 01:31:31.300
He was going to prove him wrong.

01:31:31.300 --> 01:31:34.690
With his chimp who,
he named Nim Chimpsky,

01:31:34.690 --> 01:31:36.220
to disprove Noam Chomsky.

01:31:36.220 --> 01:31:38.070
So there was Nim Chimpsky.

01:31:38.070 --> 01:31:42.740
And Nim Chimpsky starts
learning American Sign Language,

01:31:42.740 --> 01:31:44.030
like all the other ones.

01:31:44.030 --> 01:31:46.540
And Nim Chimpsky,
as opposed to, like,

01:31:46.540 --> 01:31:49.300
Washoe, who's living out there
in the American West, and

01:31:49.300 --> 01:31:51.450
manifest destiny
and all of that,

01:31:51.450 --> 01:31:53.980
Nim Chimpsky lived in a
townhouse up on the west side

01:31:53.980 --> 01:31:58.240
of Manhattan, and was
a regular favorite

01:31:58.240 --> 01:32:00.872
at Lincoln Center, and
Zabar's and all of that.

01:32:00.872 --> 01:32:02.580
And the person who
got the bagel probably

01:32:02.580 --> 01:32:04.870
knows what I'm referring
to, but nobody else does.

01:32:04.870 --> 01:32:07.120
And Nim was just
growing up there,

01:32:07.120 --> 01:32:08.280
and learning sign language.

01:32:08.280 --> 01:32:09.500
And Nim was great.

01:32:09.500 --> 01:32:11.650
And Nim was terrific,
and learning just as fast

01:32:11.650 --> 01:32:12.500
as the other ones.

01:32:12.500 --> 01:32:15.590
And, actually, the summer
after my freshman year,

01:32:15.590 --> 01:32:19.610
I spent the summer working with
Nim, which was incredible fun,

01:32:19.610 --> 01:32:22.610
and tickling him, and
him not tickling me back.

01:32:22.610 --> 01:32:25.900
And it was all so exciting,
and getting to do this

01:32:25.900 --> 01:32:27.882
all day long with a chimp.

01:32:27.882 --> 01:32:30.160
And moving on, and
then Terrace and crew

01:32:30.160 --> 01:32:31.520
beginning to expand on this.

01:32:31.520 --> 01:32:34.640
And then, suddenly,
about three years later,

01:32:34.640 --> 01:32:38.320
out comes this big
landmark paper in Science

01:32:38.320 --> 01:32:40.100
by Terrace and some
of the colleagues

01:32:40.100 --> 01:32:43.610
there basically
saying, you know what?

01:32:43.610 --> 01:32:45.250
Nim is totally cool.

01:32:45.250 --> 01:32:48.262
And he is a blast to
spend a long weekend with,

01:32:48.262 --> 01:32:49.220
and that sort of thing.

01:32:49.220 --> 01:32:52.200
But he's not learning language.

01:32:52.200 --> 01:32:54.020
This really doesn't count.

01:32:54.020 --> 01:32:55.060
And you know what?

01:32:55.060 --> 01:32:57.480
None of the other
ones are either.

01:32:57.480 --> 01:33:02.190
And what you had was the
first real hard-assed analysis

01:33:02.190 --> 01:33:04.040
of what these animals
were producing.

01:33:04.040 --> 01:33:07.860
And what Terrace demonstrated
in this paper in great detail

01:33:07.860 --> 01:33:12.380
was nothing Nim was doing fit
the criteria for language.

01:33:12.380 --> 01:33:15.140
Nim was not inventing words.

01:33:15.140 --> 01:33:18.260
Nim was not getting
word ordering correct.

01:33:18.260 --> 01:33:21.330
Word ordering was basically
at the random level.

01:33:21.330 --> 01:33:24.520
Me eat, and eat me,
50% chance of either

01:33:24.520 --> 01:33:26.580
when expressing the same notion.

01:33:26.580 --> 01:33:28.950
Nim was failing to
do something that

01:33:28.950 --> 01:33:31.410
was very fundamental
to language,

01:33:31.410 --> 01:33:35.830
which was the more words in your
string, the more meaning to it.

01:33:35.830 --> 01:33:38.100
And what I have on the
handout at the very top

01:33:38.100 --> 01:33:40.820
was some famous quote
from Nim who was just

01:33:40.820 --> 01:33:43.170
babbling on
something incoherent,

01:33:43.170 --> 01:33:45.160
suggesting like a
Broca's aphasia,

01:33:45.160 --> 01:33:46.450
except that he was fine.

01:33:46.450 --> 01:33:49.340
As the utterances
got longer, they

01:33:49.340 --> 01:33:51.930
didn't contain more information.

01:33:51.930 --> 01:33:55.710
Moreover, the utterances
were not spontaneous.

01:33:55.710 --> 01:33:58.940
Language is not about
answering questions.

01:33:58.940 --> 01:34:01.830
Language is about
choosing to communicate.

01:34:01.830 --> 01:34:04.450
Nim was not generating
any of this.

01:34:04.450 --> 01:34:07.280
He was responding to,
if you answer this,

01:34:07.280 --> 01:34:10.277
you will get a fruit loop,
which is what he mainly ate.

01:34:10.277 --> 01:34:12.110
And, thus, most of the
people on the project

01:34:12.110 --> 01:34:15.330
were constantly stealing
his fruit loops from him.

01:34:15.330 --> 01:34:17.450
So this looked pretty bad.

01:34:17.450 --> 01:34:19.250
And what Terrace
then proceeded to do

01:34:19.250 --> 01:34:22.270
was the same analysis on
all the other projects.

01:34:22.270 --> 01:34:25.310
And none of the chimps
were doing anything.

01:34:25.310 --> 01:34:27.700
All of them were failing
these same criteria

01:34:27.700 --> 01:34:30.700
of accurate word
ordering, expanded

01:34:30.700 --> 01:34:33.780
meaning with longer utterances,
spontaneous, all of that.

01:34:33.780 --> 01:34:38.050
Washoe, oh, coming up,
the duck is a water bird.

01:34:38.050 --> 01:34:42.800
Washoe was saying, water, bird.

01:34:42.800 --> 01:34:44.990
No, it had not just
neologistically come

01:34:44.990 --> 01:34:48.330
up-- if that's the word--
with a new word for duck

01:34:48.330 --> 01:34:49.885
in American Sign Language.

01:34:49.885 --> 01:34:50.760
It wasn't doing that.

01:34:50.760 --> 01:34:52.390
The word ordering made no sense.

01:34:52.390 --> 01:34:53.780
It was completely random.

01:34:53.780 --> 01:34:57.100
Terrace rips apart
the whole literature.

01:34:57.100 --> 01:35:00.780
So out of that emerges the
great, bloodied prizefight

01:35:00.780 --> 01:35:04.097
of 1983 between Terrace
and Penny Patterson.

01:35:04.097 --> 01:35:05.680
Penny Patterson, who
had by that point

01:35:05.680 --> 01:35:08.380
had stolen Koko from
the San Francisco Zoo--

01:35:08.380 --> 01:35:09.850
and you think I'm kidding.

01:35:09.850 --> 01:35:12.740
She had been promised Koko for
only a certain number of years.

01:35:12.740 --> 01:35:14.906
And then, of course, she
was going to give him back.

01:35:14.906 --> 01:35:17.830
And when it was time for her
to give him back, she said,

01:35:17.830 --> 01:35:20.940
I'm not giving him back because
he has human values now.

01:35:20.940 --> 01:35:23.620
And it would be unfair for
him to live with a gorilla.

01:35:23.620 --> 01:35:28.320
So that was just on the edge
of being a lawsuit built around

01:35:28.320 --> 01:35:30.460
whether or not Koko
could be emancipated

01:35:30.460 --> 01:35:32.530
along the lines of
having human values,

01:35:32.530 --> 01:35:35.110
because she had
been, like, skating

01:35:35.110 --> 01:35:38.790
on Lake Lagunita when it was
frozen, or things like that.

01:35:38.790 --> 01:35:41.760
And the San Francisco Zoo,
seeing a public relations

01:35:41.760 --> 01:35:44.760
disaster on the horizon,
decided, what the hell?

01:35:44.760 --> 01:35:48.310
Let's give Koko, let's
give this $60,000 gorilla

01:35:48.310 --> 01:35:50.570
to Penny Patterson,
who by that point

01:35:50.570 --> 01:35:53.520
had pretty much had her
association with Stanford cut,

01:35:53.520 --> 01:35:56.340
and by then was
up in the Woodside

01:35:56.340 --> 01:36:00.180
Hills at a large estate paid
for by gorilla enthusiasts,

01:36:00.180 --> 01:36:02.640
and hanging out there with Koko.

01:36:02.640 --> 01:36:06.450
So Patterson winds up being
the strongest defender

01:36:06.450 --> 01:36:10.100
down to the end that this
is real language that Coco

01:36:10.100 --> 01:36:11.020
is doing.

01:36:11.020 --> 01:36:14.610
And Terrace, going completely
after it-- and one problem

01:36:14.610 --> 01:36:17.720
at that point was there were
no actual data that had ever

01:36:17.720 --> 01:36:19.340
been published by Patterson.

01:36:19.340 --> 01:36:23.100
All there were, were some
several heartwarming films

01:36:23.100 --> 01:36:26.670
of Koko, Koko and
global warming,

01:36:26.670 --> 01:36:30.080
and Koko and the trade deficit,
and Koko and this or that.

01:36:30.080 --> 01:36:31.194
And there were no data.

01:36:31.194 --> 01:36:32.860
Scientists couldn't
make any sense of it

01:36:32.860 --> 01:36:34.580
because there were no numbers.

01:36:34.580 --> 01:36:37.270
There was no anything
you can actually analyze.

01:36:37.270 --> 01:36:38.970
And when you look at the films.

01:36:38.970 --> 01:36:41.060
And they would be pitiful.

01:36:41.060 --> 01:36:42.540
They would be pitiful.

01:36:42.540 --> 01:36:44.580
Koko would be sitting
there, for one thing,

01:36:44.580 --> 01:36:48.040
would never be generating
spontaneous utterances.

01:36:48.040 --> 01:36:51.270
Koko would be sitting there
having the same word order

01:36:51.270 --> 01:36:53.430
randomness as all the chimps.

01:36:53.430 --> 01:36:55.915
Koko would be having--
and part of the problem

01:36:55.915 --> 01:37:00.780
was Patterson kept
enabling Koko.

01:37:00.780 --> 01:37:02.890
She would ask Koko, what
do you call this thing?

01:37:02.890 --> 01:37:05.880
And Koko would come up with
a completely wrong sign.

01:37:05.880 --> 01:37:10.280
And Patterson would say,
oh, stop kidding around.

01:37:10.280 --> 01:37:14.300
And then Patterson would
show her the next one.

01:37:14.300 --> 01:37:16.580
And Koko would get
it completely wrong.

01:37:16.580 --> 01:37:21.630
And Patterson would say,
oh, you funny gorilla.

01:37:21.630 --> 01:37:23.900
And then-- I'm really serious.

01:37:23.900 --> 01:37:24.951
And I mean it this time.

01:37:24.951 --> 01:37:26.450
And so when she
gets it wrong again.

01:37:26.450 --> 01:37:29.090
And, oh, Koko, is
being so ironic.

01:37:29.090 --> 01:37:30.270
What?

01:37:30.270 --> 01:37:31.790
What are you talking about?

01:37:31.790 --> 01:37:34.570
She's going on like that
in these films here.

01:37:34.570 --> 01:37:37.680
And as you look closely
using the sort of criteria

01:37:37.680 --> 01:37:40.910
that Terrace was using,
your socks new more

01:37:40.910 --> 01:37:43.530
American Sign Language
than this gorilla did.

01:37:43.530 --> 01:37:45.850
it's showing none
of the spontaneity,

01:37:45.850 --> 01:37:48.600
none of the word ordering,
none of any of that stuff.

01:37:48.600 --> 01:37:50.110
So out came the knives.

01:37:50.110 --> 01:37:51.880
And here were the basic stances.

01:37:51.880 --> 01:37:54.370
Terrace's stance was
Patterson wouldn't

01:37:54.370 --> 01:37:59.000
know a controlled experiment
if it hit her over the head.

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.390
Patterson's response
was, Terrace

01:38:01.390 --> 01:38:04.740
was this cold, affectless
fish who had driven Nim

01:38:04.740 --> 01:38:06.990
into virtual autism.

01:38:06.990 --> 01:38:09.250
And this guy Terrace
was not someone

01:38:09.250 --> 01:38:12.710
who you would want to sort
of cozy up and on his lap

01:38:12.710 --> 01:38:15.562
and have him tell you
bedtime stories or whatever.

01:38:15.562 --> 01:38:19.320
And another feature that
Patterson pointed out very,

01:38:19.320 --> 01:38:23.650
very accurately was Nim had
no continuity of teachers.

01:38:23.650 --> 01:38:27.240
Nim had all sorts of people
who knew three and a half

01:38:27.240 --> 01:38:30.830
more words of sign language than
he did-- like me, for example--

01:38:30.830 --> 01:38:33.610
who would show up for a
summer, and then disappear.

01:38:33.610 --> 01:38:36.220
He was going through 20, 30
different teachers a year.

01:38:36.220 --> 01:38:40.300
Oh, that's not a very good
setting for learning stuff.

01:38:40.300 --> 01:38:41.830
That's not ideal.

01:38:41.830 --> 01:38:44.200
Language is not
just about language.

01:38:44.200 --> 01:38:46.570
It's about the
emotional relationships.

01:38:46.570 --> 01:38:49.270
And Nim ultimately wound up
being a pretty screwed up

01:38:49.270 --> 01:38:52.740
chimp in terms of like
nobody stable in his life

01:38:52.740 --> 01:38:54.690
except for this cold
fish Terrace who

01:38:54.690 --> 01:38:56.410
basically didn't like him.

01:38:56.410 --> 01:38:59.430
So it's going back and
forth, and these accusations.

01:38:59.430 --> 01:39:03.582
And Patterson coming out
with just incredible stuff,

01:39:03.582 --> 01:39:05.290
and Terrace going after her.

01:39:05.290 --> 01:39:09.950
And then things
got really dirty,

01:39:09.950 --> 01:39:12.670
Patterson beginning to
suggest that maybe Nim

01:39:12.670 --> 01:39:16.240
wasn't playing with a full deck
compared to the other-- oh,

01:39:16.240 --> 01:39:20.300
so Terrace got the stupidest
chimp in the entire literature

01:39:20.300 --> 01:39:23.320
there, and did the best
analysis on his inadequacies,

01:39:23.320 --> 01:39:27.260
and is trying to take down the
whole field-- totally messy,

01:39:27.260 --> 01:39:29.340
messy sort of conflict there.

01:39:29.340 --> 01:39:31.420
And pretty much the
whole field collapsed

01:39:31.420 --> 01:39:33.320
in the aftermath of it.

01:39:33.320 --> 01:39:35.460
Patterson is still up in
the hills of Woodside.

01:39:35.460 --> 01:39:37.210
Although I hear rumors
she's about to move

01:39:37.210 --> 01:39:39.700
to Hawaii with Koko
to a large estate

01:39:39.700 --> 01:39:42.630
that she's gotten
somebody to give her.

01:39:42.630 --> 01:39:48.066
She sends out things like
newsletters talking about Koko

01:39:48.066 --> 01:39:51.710
sends greetings for world
peace, and things of that sort.

01:39:51.710 --> 01:39:52.950
I met her once.

01:39:52.950 --> 01:39:56.045
And she wanted to talk
about this gorilla Michael

01:39:56.045 --> 01:39:58.950
was brought in who was
supposed to mate with her.

01:39:58.950 --> 01:40:01.570
But they brought him in
when he was too young.

01:40:01.570 --> 01:40:04.940
And they did a kibbutz brother
and sister deal instead,

01:40:04.940 --> 01:40:07.090
and just did folk
songs together.

01:40:07.090 --> 01:40:08.367
And Michael wasn't working.

01:40:08.367 --> 01:40:09.450
He wasn't mating with her.

01:40:09.450 --> 01:40:11.980
So they eventually brought
in this big, larger male.

01:40:11.980 --> 01:40:14.320
And Michael promptly
died of heart disease,

01:40:14.320 --> 01:40:17.820
which I thought probably had
a major stress component.

01:40:17.820 --> 01:40:19.510
And that seemed
perfectly legitimate,

01:40:19.510 --> 01:40:20.610
and was talking with that.

01:40:20.610 --> 01:40:23.140
And then was
informed that October

01:40:23.140 --> 01:40:26.070
is going to be really tough,
because the end of October

01:40:26.070 --> 01:40:27.750
is Michael's birthday.

01:40:27.750 --> 01:40:30.415
And Koko is going to have
a really hard-- saying,

01:40:30.415 --> 01:40:32.348
is anybody else hearing this?

01:40:32.348 --> 01:40:33.764
Am I the only one
hearing this who

01:40:33.764 --> 01:40:35.090
thinks something is off here?

01:40:35.090 --> 01:40:36.750
They have continued there.

01:40:36.750 --> 01:40:39.940
And Terrace pretty much took
down the rest of the field.

01:40:39.940 --> 01:40:42.020
In the aftermath, and
the remnants of it,

01:40:42.020 --> 01:40:45.060
there remains one chimp
who I think legitimately

01:40:45.060 --> 01:40:48.370
qualifies as using
something beginning

01:40:48.370 --> 01:40:50.380
to resemble true language.

01:40:50.380 --> 01:40:53.300
And this is a bonobo
chimp named Kanzi.

01:40:53.300 --> 01:40:55.630
And Kanzi, they are
doing everything right.

01:40:55.630 --> 01:40:59.390
It is clear that Kanzi
is incredibly smart.

01:40:59.390 --> 01:41:02.270
They are doing all
sorts of data analysis.

01:41:02.270 --> 01:41:04.320
And Kanzi is learning stuff.

01:41:04.320 --> 01:41:06.490
Kanzi is doing embedded clauses.

01:41:06.490 --> 01:41:09.920
Kanzi does if-then stuff,
logical progressions.

01:41:09.920 --> 01:41:12.040
Kanzi is able to do a
whole bunch of things.

01:41:12.040 --> 01:41:15.230
Kanzi can do analogy.

01:41:15.230 --> 01:41:19.790
Small ball is to small
bucket, as big ball is to--

01:41:19.790 --> 01:41:22.580
and she will
indicate big bucket.

01:41:22.580 --> 01:41:24.680
She can do analogies like that.

01:41:24.680 --> 01:41:27.540
And most intriguingly,
not only is Kanzi

01:41:27.540 --> 01:41:30.870
generating language, and
spontaneous and all of that,

01:41:30.870 --> 01:41:34.640
is that when Kanzi makes
mistakes identifying things,

01:41:34.640 --> 01:41:37.650
they tend to be within
semantic categories.

01:41:37.650 --> 01:41:40.650
She accidentally comes up
with the sign for apple

01:41:40.650 --> 01:41:42.610
when she means to say orange.

01:41:42.610 --> 01:41:44.830
She doesn't accidentally
come up with the sign

01:41:44.830 --> 01:41:47.930
for existentialism when
she means to say orange.

01:41:47.930 --> 01:41:51.410
It's semantic categories,
exactly the sort of stuff

01:41:51.410 --> 01:41:52.250
you need.

01:41:52.250 --> 01:41:55.822
So at this stage, most of that
field went down in flames.

01:41:55.822 --> 01:41:58.280
At one point, people were making
a big deal out of the fact

01:41:58.280 --> 01:42:01.490
that there's not a whole lot
of gorillas left on Earth.

01:42:01.490 --> 01:42:04.040
And when, supposedly,
Koko and Michael

01:42:04.040 --> 01:42:06.870
were able to be talking their
hearts out with each other,

01:42:06.870 --> 01:42:10.410
when you calculated those two
gorillas, and the total number

01:42:10.410 --> 01:42:13.680
of gorillas on Earth, and how
many people speak American Sign

01:42:13.680 --> 01:42:16.280
Language, and how many
people on Earth there are,

01:42:16.280 --> 01:42:18.990
a greater percentage
of Earth's gorillas

01:42:18.990 --> 01:42:21.970
were speaking American Sign
Language than Earth's humans.

01:42:21.970 --> 01:42:24.130
Like, that was stuff
coming out at that time.

01:42:24.130 --> 01:42:26.270
So the entire field
has collapsed.

01:42:26.270 --> 01:42:28.200
Kanzi remains
about the only hope

01:42:28.200 --> 01:42:30.040
for making sense of
anything going on

01:42:30.040 --> 01:42:33.982
with this-- really appealing,
seductive stuff, not

01:42:33.982 --> 01:42:34.940
a whole lot of science.

01:42:34.940 --> 01:42:37.850
OK, so what we will
pick up on on Wednesday

01:42:37.850 --> 01:42:41.383
is the genetics evolution
of language, and then--

01:42:42.150 --> 01:42:45.540
