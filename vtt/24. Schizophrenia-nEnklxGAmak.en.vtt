Stanford University.

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:13.440
Variety of announcements,
tomorrow, office hours

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.580
are shifted because
at 4:30, there's

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.220
a really interesting
lecture over at Clark.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.700
This guy is one of the
experts on the whole notion

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.570
that there are brain
metabolic abnormalities

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.080
in sociopathic humans,
violent criminals.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.050
He's got the distinction
of having the world's only

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:34.460
portable MRI.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.720
He has a big old Winnebago
with an MRI machine.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.560
And he drives all
around the country

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.640
from one maximum security
prison to another,

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.030
trying to look at aspects of
frontal cortical dysfunction

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.500
in extremely
violent individuals.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.500
I have no idea if he's
a good lecturer or not,

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.770
the material is going to
be really interesting.

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.670
So that's something
that probably should

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.760
be caught Friday,
again, is not going

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.430
to be videotape,
but just audiotape

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:02.600
for a number of reasons.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:08.970
Finally, over next
year, I will be doing,

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.780
if anyone is interested,
some directed readings

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.770
with people that are--
that will be essentially

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.690
more of an exploration of some
of the topics in the course

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:19.320
here.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.600
So if you are interested, do
not send me anything whatsoever

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.230
until it's the summer.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:30.650
At that point, CV, transcript,
anything I need to know,

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.070
but it will be posted
on the coursework,

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.680
so as to more details about it.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.980
So we pick up with the
homestretch here of language.

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.550
And what we got to just on
the edge of two days ago

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.620
is the now begin to look at
the genetics of language use.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.810
In general, there's the
usual types of techniques

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.350
for behavior genetics.

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.280
The first is looking
for covariance

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.140
of certain language
abnormalities

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.030
in certain families.

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.820
And the evidence for that is
clear with Williams syndrome,

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.280
with the selective
language impairment.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.340
Those tend to run
in families and they

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.170
tend to show classical
Mendelian inheritance,

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.130
very readily thought
of as genetically

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:15.890
influenced disorders.

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.660
Then, going to our
usual deal of looking

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.360
at adopted individuals, twins,
identical twins separated

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.700
at birth, that
whole armamentarium

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.620
of behavioral genetics
stuff, what does that show?

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.400
There's a fair degree
of heritability

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.700
of things like vocabulary
complexity, ability to spell,

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.230
skill at phonology,
things of that sort.

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.470
In general, the
evidence is pretty

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.266
poor for a strong genetic
load on dyslexias,

00:02:46.266 --> 00:02:49.520
on learning disorders
of that type.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.770
Of course, the
modern version of it

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.400
all is to start looking
at the actual genes,

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.270
the molecular biology of
language disorders, of language

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:59.290
in general.

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.180
First thing that
comes up is this gene

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.030
that has been at the center of
the whole field for years now,

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.890
a gene called FOXP2.

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.510
And it was originally
identified as having a mutation

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.050
in a family that had a very
specific linguistic problem

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.830
running through it,
language generation speech.

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:23.630
This family had severe
problems with it,

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.220
classic looking for
a genetic marker,

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.410
and eventually narrowing
down to the gene

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:34.340
itself, turning out to be this
mysterious gene FOXP2, which

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.430
turned out to be a
transcription factor,

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.600
and a mutation in
it in this family.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.590
What immediately became
clear is this theme

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.060
over and over again
with language,

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.610
in so far as there's a
problem in this family,

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.700
is it at the cognitive
level of what language

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.940
is about symbolically or is
it just getting your lips

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.970
and tongues and articulating
and that much more

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.250
mechanical level.

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.370
It initially looked
like it was much more

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.180
the latter in this family.

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.120
It is apparently more
of a mixture of both,

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.600
just to make things
really confusing.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.930
What you see is it
is preferentially

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.140
expressed in that
part of the brain

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.410
we heard about the other
day, the basal ganglia.

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.100
That area that's playing a
role in gesturing when you're

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.800
speaking, playing a
role in facial prosody,

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.340
that sort of stuff, motoric
stuff, and the fact that it was

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.790
found so heavily
expressed in there

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:32.370
was part of what got people
to think what's fundamentally

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.250
wrong with this family is motor
aspects of language production.

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.400
Again, it's gotten
messier since then

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.510
because these folks
have a variety

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:45.870
of cognitive impairments
in the realm of language.

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.700
So, of course, immediately,
what we need to be asking

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:52.260
is what's FOXP2 doing
in other species.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.400
Does it occur in other species?

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.050
And it turns out that it
is all over the place.

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.790
You find FOXP2 in
birds and mammals

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:03.990
and all sorts of
things, large and small.

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.560
It is very, very widespread.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.970
But, importantly, a
different version than you

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:11.330
find in humans.

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.450
It is immensely
conserved, which is

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:18.460
to say you see the
same version of FOXP2

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.340
ranging from apes to birds,
everything in between.

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.350
Nothing has changed
with that evolutionarily

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.555
in a long, long time.

00:05:27.555 --> 00:05:28.935
So what does it do?

00:05:28.935 --> 00:05:33.280
A handful of studies in animals
where the gene has been knocked

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.730
out, it has been removed,
where you now have

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:38.460
mice that do not have the gene.

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:42.250
And what you see is there
is less of vocalization

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:44.650
and simpler vocalization.

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:46.230
And that's back
to our whole world

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:50.240
of that subsonic
vocalizations that you

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.052
can't hear when
mice are giggling

00:05:52.052 --> 00:05:53.010
and that sort of thing.

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:56.490
Knock out this gene, and
there's less vocalizing

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:59.370
and there's less
complexity to it.

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:02.840
So we're just doing something
or other that looks plausible.

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.870
And it's expressed
in motoric parts

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:08.570
of the brain preferentially
in these other species.

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:10.740
So this super
conservative version

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.940
of this gene, everybody
else has the same version.

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.190
And then you look
at the human version

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:19.030
and there's a bunch
of differences

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:22.650
and they emerged very
recently, best estimates

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:25.580
are the last couple
of 100,000 years.

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.150
Each one of the
changes extremely

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:32.320
positively selected for,
whatever this gene is about,

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:35.150
once it sort of went
on the human path,

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:40.130
it changed real fast under
major selective advantageous

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:40.910
conditions.

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:43.310
And thus, we've got a
real different version

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:45.320
from everyone else.

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:47.380
The next interesting
thing about it,

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:51.280
in so far as it is a
transcription factor, when

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:54.770
you look at the genes that
it regulates-- so this is now

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:58.560
taking her step further, our
old genetic network deal,

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:01.560
when you look downstream,
what genes it regulates,

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:04.800
they tend to be
fairly differentiated

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.890
from other primates and
to have differentiated

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:10.360
as a result of
positive selection.

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:13.300
So this is a whole
cluster of genes

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:16.090
that evolution was doing
some pretty stringent things

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:20.900
on in hominids in the last
couple of 100,000 years.

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:24.920
Now, what you do is one of the
all-time cool studies, which

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:27.620
was last year,
which you take mice

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:30.980
and you knock out
their FOXP2 gene.

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:35.490
And now, you stick
in the human version.

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:40.410
And, amazingly, what happens
is once these animals mature,

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:44.414
they speak just
like Mickey Mouse.

00:07:44.414 --> 00:07:45.330
People were listening.

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:48.200
What you wind up seeing
is-- it's probably

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:50.210
the Disney people probably
are working on it,

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:51.793
and that's going to
be the end of life

00:07:51.793 --> 00:07:53.740
as we know it when they
let those ones lose.

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:56.870
What you get when you
overexpress-- when you express

00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:59.810
the human FOXP2 in
a mouse is a mouse

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:04.620
with more vocalizations
and more complex ones.

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:09.520
Whoa, that is mighty interesting
area of lots and lots of work

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:12.320
these days, trying to figure
out what this transcription

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:13.540
factor is about.

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:17.560
But, clearly, just
this screaming imprint

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:20.290
of major league selection
that has gone on

00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:23.120
for the human version
and for the genes

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:26.030
that it regulates,
fairly recently, it

00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:29.500
is no surprise that this
gene is central to such

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:32.650
a different unique
thing that we're doing.

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:35.434
More evidence for genetic
components of the language,

00:08:35.434 --> 00:08:37.919
and this one is a
very indirect one

00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:40.293
with this totally
interesting phenomenon that

00:08:40.293 --> 00:08:43.120
has been shown in lots and
lots of different places

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:44.950
on the globe.

00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:48.510
So you get some circumstance
where a whole bunch of people

00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:50.945
are brought together
from different cultures,

00:08:50.945 --> 00:08:53.840
with different language
groups, and why they're

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:55.940
having to deal with each other.

00:08:55.940 --> 00:09:01.630
Classic version is you get,
for example, slave populations

00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:03.680
brought from different
places in West Africa

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:05.600
to some of the
Caribbean islands.

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:08.450
You have, on some of
the Hawaiian Islands,

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:11.720
early in the last century,
people from all over Asia

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:15.220
are brought over to worth
the plantations there,

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:16.550
the fields, whatever.

00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:18.300
What you have in
these cases, there's

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:21.160
a whole bunch of people
thrown together who

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:23.700
have languages from
every which way

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:25.700
who don't understand each other.

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:27.480
And what always
emerges, what has

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:30.600
been extremely
well-documented, is some sort

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:34.660
of fragmentary
communication system that

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:37.950
is made up of bits and pieces
of all the relevant languages,

00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:41.260
which everybody can kind of
limp through and begin to be

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.110
understood with each other.

00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:46.946
And what that is wounds up being
called is a pidgin language.

00:09:46.946 --> 00:09:51.480
Pidgin, very simplistic version
that shows virtually nothing

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:55.350
in the way of complex
grammar, and it's basically

00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:57.490
a vehicle for
getting individuals

00:09:57.490 --> 00:09:59.380
who almost always,
in these cases,

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:03.450
are societally pretty under
the foot of powers that

00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:06.660
be to deal with each other,
to work with each other,

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:10.530
working out this proto
proto communication system

00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:13.670
with fragments of each language.

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:15.300
That's not surprising.

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:19.730
What is totally cool is what
happens next over the next one

00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:24.320
to two generations, which
is this pidgin thing,

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:27.960
this committee glued
together amalgamation

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:29.870
of fragments of
different languages

00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:32.680
within a generation
or two has evolved

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:35.050
into a real language,
which is then

00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:37.420
known as a creole language.

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:39.730
Creole languages
are languages that

00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:43.020
are a couple of generations
descended from pidgin.

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:47.800
And what you see is it winds
up being a real language.

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:51.450
That's fine, that's fine,
given that, two days ago, we're

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:53.220
hearing that it was
possible for kids

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:56.130
to come up and invent
Nicaragua in sign language

00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:58.170
within a generation.

00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:00.100
So you start with
this pidgin thing,

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:01.820
and within a couple
of generations,

00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:04.470
it turns into a real
language, fits the rules,

00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:05.710
grammar, all of that.

00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:08.470
Here is the thing
that is so interesting

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:13.330
about this phenomenon, which
is all of the creoles have

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:17.010
the same grammatical structure.

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:18.500
What is that about?

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:21.160
Creoles from all
over the planet that

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:23.850
were built upon all
sorts of differing

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:27.660
hodgepodge of the original
languages in the pidgin, Creole

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:33.170
languages all have a similar
grammatical structure.

00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:36.570
Easy explanation, easy
boring one, which is it's

00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:40.440
very simple grammatical
structures and this

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:42.050
is a language that's
just getting off

00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:43.490
its feet in each case.

00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:47.940
No, in all these cases it
is grammatical structures

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:50.200
that are not necessarily
the simplest.

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:53.050
It's not just some
baby step languages.

00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:56.030
It's languages that
all seem to come up

00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:58.280
with the same graphical
structures there.

00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:01.100
And what this has given
rise to is the notion

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:06.030
that there is a default
grammar built into humans.

00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:09.310
Let humans go running with
a whole bunch of fragments

00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:12.120
in different languages
and, not surprisingly, we

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:15.100
were able to turn it into
a real communicative system

00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:16.880
within a generation or two.

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:19.620
And when pulling
language out of thin air,

00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:23.140
humans always tend to
come up with the same sort

00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:26.010
of grammatical structures
that are not necessarily

00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:29.220
the simplest, argument there
being there is an innate,

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:34.270
there is a hard wire, there is
an ancient pattern of grammar

00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:36.710
that humans use when they
come up with a language.

00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:38.920
So totally interesting.

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:41.480
What you find, also,
with the sign languages,

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:44.820
as they get invented,
Nicaraguan sign language,

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:46.630
it went through a
first generation

00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:49.660
of being pidgin, and soon
turned into a signing

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:51.080
equivalent of creole.

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:54.300
And it has some of the same
grammatical structures.

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:58.370
Even when humans are defaulting
into a new language that's

00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:01.730
purely gestural, it shows
some of these constraints

00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:04.520
that you see with
the creole languages.

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:06.670
Other features of this
that come through,

00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:10.260
apparently, there's like
24 different ways that you

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:14.240
can put together objects,
and subjects, and rejects,

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:18.200
the participles, and whatever
it is, grammatical structures.

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:20.200
This guy, Joseph
Greenberg, linguist,

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:22.580
who was here at Stanford
until a few years ago when

00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:25.870
he died, apparently,
incredible titan in the field,

00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:27.210
he did some of this research.

00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:29.600
There's 24 possible
different ways

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:32.500
languages can do this
object subject business,

00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:36.540
and all across the earth,
all across the 6000 languages

00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:40.120
there, you only see
15 of them used.

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:43.420
And the vast majority
of grammars on earth

00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:45.600
only use four of them.

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:47.830
So the argument there
winds up being this

00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:50.450
is a pretty nonrandom skew.

00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:55.750
Again, we're seeing some kind
of prepared learning default

00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:59.260
grammars, this very
imprecise sense of there's

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.050
something genetic
floating around here.

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:04.590
So that complementary
to the whole world

00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:06.390
instead of looking
at things like FOXP2

00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:10.100
and this mutations, the usual
two very different approaches.

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:12.730
That whole pidgin
to creole transition

00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:17.870
is really, really interesting
and it really has this feel

00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:21.920
in the undercurrents of it that
there is a basic human grammar

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:24.040
that floats around
there, a notion

00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:27.400
that Chomsky has pushed
for a long, long time.

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:31.020
Jumping one box further
back, ecological factors

00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:32.280
and language.

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:35.120
I'm going to touch on that only
briefly, but what you've got

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:39.400
is something similar to a theme
we heard a couple of weeks ago,

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:43.030
which is possibly not something
we heard a couple weeks ago

00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:44.420
and we'll instead
hear on Friday.

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:48.940
But what you see is
diverse ecosystems,

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:51.950
very biodiverse ecosystems.

00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:54.790
Rain forest ones,
for example, produce

00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:58.545
cultures which have a great
deal of diversity in them.

00:14:58.545 --> 00:15:00.520
What we're going
to see on Friday,

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:02.500
the version of
that, which I'm now

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:06.380
thinking I did mention before,
is that polytheistic cultures

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:09.480
are the things you tend to
see coming out of rain forest

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:12.530
settings, that notion that if
there's hundreds, if there's

00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:15.700
a thousand different types of
edible plants in your world,

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:17.850
it doesn't take a great
leap to decide there's

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:21.530
a whole lot of different spurred
things in the world going

00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:22.120
on there.

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:25.460
Polytheism, a very
similar theme,

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:28.790
great work done a few years ago,
a guy named William Sutherland

00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:31.700
from the University of Dundee,
I think, where what he showed

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:34.850
was looking all over
the planet, looking

00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:37.480
at the biodiversity
in different regions

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:41.170
on the planet, the more
ecological diversity,

00:15:41.170 --> 00:15:44.740
the more linguistic diversity
you would find in that region.

00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:47.190
The more different
languages, which, of course,

00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:50.760
thus translates down into
small groups, small numbers

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:53.880
of speakers, this is an
interesting phenomenon,

00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:56.490
which it's not completely clear
to me what to make of that.

00:15:56.490 --> 00:15:59.400
But ecosystems that
are very diverse

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:04.140
generate an abundance
of theistic notions

00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:07.970
and at above expected
rates and also produces

00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:11.190
a whole lot more languages,
something on the diversity

00:16:11.190 --> 00:16:12.070
there.

00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:14.850
What his work then showed
is about everything else

00:16:14.850 --> 00:16:17.290
I'm going to say in
this area, which is just

00:16:17.290 --> 00:16:22.250
totally depressing stuff, which
is linguistic diversity is

00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:25.480
going down the tubes
faster than biodiversity.

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:28.270
He shows that the rate
of language extinction

00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:32.510
proportionately is faster
than the rate of extinction

00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:35.210
of various species, plants, etc.

00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:38.870
In these rain forest
ecosystems, totally grim,

00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:40.610
depressing picture.

00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:43.730
What seems to be the case,
given where things are heading,

00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:46.630
is in the next century,
in this century,

00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:50.300
90% of Earth's languages
will go extinct.

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:53.090
The vast majority of
humans on this planet

00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:55.230
speak less than 10
different languages

00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:57.500
out of the 6,000 existing ones.

00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:58.850
How's this for depressing?

00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:02.190
There's a couple of hundred
different languages that

00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:07.859
are Inuit, and Northwest
Native American,

00:17:07.859 --> 00:17:11.000
and some other
population as well.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.980
And currently, only of
5% of those languages

00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:18.230
have speakers who
are not elderly.

00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:19.810
That's real depressing.

00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:23.250
Also, and something that
strikes me as extraordinary

00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:26.359
is, in each one of those
cases, somewhere along the way,

00:17:26.359 --> 00:17:28.890
there's going to be
somebody in old age

00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:32.330
who's the last person on earth
who understands their language.

00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:34.910
There's not a single
other person alive

00:17:34.910 --> 00:17:37.840
who will be able to talk in
their mother tongue with them.

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:40.560
Language is disappearing
left and right,

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:43.390
along with, of course,
cultural diversity

00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:45.650
going down the
tubes, the process

00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:47.540
of turning the whole
world into a lowest

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:50.340
common denominator of
McDonald's culture, blah, blah.

00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:53.530
Along with that comes
a huge, huge loss

00:17:53.530 --> 00:17:55.620
of language diversity.

00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:58.300
Finally, jumping
to our last box,

00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:00.460
if we're talking about
ecological factors,

00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:02.310
thinking about
things like genes,

00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:04.560
thinking about things
like highly, highly

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:08.060
driven positive selection
for genes like FOXP2

00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:11.450
in humans, of course, we have to
talk about the evolutionary end

00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:12.590
of things.

00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:16.260
So evolution of language
and humans, general notion

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:21.160
is click languages, which you
tend to see in hunter gatherers

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:23.970
in Africa, that that might
have been the earliest

00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:26.990
forms, the most ancient
types of languages on Earth.

00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:31.570
And what you also see is
hunter gatherers are probably

00:18:31.570 --> 00:18:34.340
the most ancient sort of
populations of humans that

00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:38.190
live in Africa, with waves
of agriculturalists coming

00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:41.020
from North Africa, the
Middle East, at later points,

00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:43.940
pastoralists coming from
around there as well.

00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:47.740
The original populations in
Africa were hunter gatherers.

00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:51.370
And they have high frequencies
of these click languages.

00:18:51.370 --> 00:18:54.760
That might be the starting
point for human language.

00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:57.750
Interestingly, though, you
also see click languages

00:18:57.750 --> 00:19:01.090
among a lot of aboriginal
groups in Australia.

00:19:01.090 --> 00:19:02.730
What does that tell you?

00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:04.590
Those became separately.

00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:07.990
There was a huge gulf
of time between leaving

00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:11.750
Africa and the first populations
winding up in Australia,

00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:13.580
convergent evolution.

00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:18.200
For some reason, click languages
is a very fundamental way

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:21.510
that people come up with
communication systems.

00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:24.970
So selection issues
often run in with

00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:29.260
our social biological notions
of language advantages,

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:31.760
it's easy to see what
the advantages are

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:33.390
of having a language system.

00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:37.590
It is easier to store,
to archive, knowledge,

00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:38.450
information.

00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:41.240
It is easier to
coordinate hunts.

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:45.490
It is easier to figure out
what we did the last time there

00:19:45.490 --> 00:19:48.860
was a famine, figuring out
things like that, all of those

00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:50.600
facilitated by language.

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:54.070
In the memorable words of
Steve Pinker from Harvard,

00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:56.900
"Language is how we
outsmart plants."

00:19:56.900 --> 00:20:01.820
Language allows us to do all
sorts of organizational stuff.

00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:05.010
Language evolution is
all about sequence.

00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:07.810
We don't say a words
simultaneously.

00:20:07.810 --> 00:20:08.980
It's all sequences.

00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:10.980
And a number of
people have emphasized

00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:14.760
that's what the construction
of tools are about also.

00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:20.170
The whole process of careful
logical sequential transitions

00:20:20.170 --> 00:20:24.130
of steps almost certainly
tool use and language use

00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:28.120
is sequential processes
emerging in parallel.

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:33.130
Finally, obviously, you see all
sorts of room for cooperation

00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:37.270
with kin selection, cooperation
with reciprocal altruism being

00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:38.970
enhanced with communication.

00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:42.380
But very importantly, for
our game theory world,

00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:44.770
what language also
allows you to do

00:20:44.770 --> 00:20:48.590
is lie, that whole
business from two days ago.

00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:51.980
In human language, there's
that arbitrariness.

00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:55.690
There's a dissociation between
the message and the messenger.

00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:57.560
It's not like dogs
that have to put

00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:00.560
the lid on their fear pheromones
by tucking their tale.

00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:03.590
What you have is
the capacity to lie.

00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:06.540
And, of course, running off
from that, a whole world

00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:09.350
of evolutionary strategizing.

00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:13.730
Pertinent to that, there's a
huge, huge disproportionate

00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:17.420
share of neurons in the
motor system devoted

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:20.930
to facial expressions,
and mouth coordination,

00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:22.890
and all that kind of world.

00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:25.630
A really good thing
if you plan to lie

00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:28.020
is to be able to
have good control

00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:30.220
over your facial expressions.

00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:33.070
Finally, formal
game theory models

00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:35.870
showing when you have pairs
of individuals playing

00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:38.470
against each other,
when you introduce,

00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:41.880
when you allow the
emergence of communication

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:44.160
between two of the
players versus not

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:47.900
in the other group, you
immediately, no surprise,

00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:49.640
have been getting
a big advantage.

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:53.150
If you allow them
semanticity, to have words

00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:56.310
that they can communicate,
that is advantageous,

00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:58.000
that improves outcome.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.630
Even better is if you allow
semanticity and structure,

00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:05.380
syntax, grammar, so
that they can have

00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:07.490
more complex communication.

00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:09.230
All of those wind
up being things

00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:13.390
that facilitate winning
in game theory settings.

00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:15.680
Finally, interesting
parallelism,

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:18.460
back to that
biodiversity stuff, which

00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:21.320
is, when you look at all those
different possible grammatical

00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:24.510
structures, the 24
of them, 15 of which

00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:26.690
is the total of what
appears on Earth,

00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:30.370
the rarest of the
grammatical structures

00:22:30.370 --> 00:22:34.940
are the ones that are
closest to extinction.

00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:37.510
The rarest not in terms
of the number of people

00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:40.530
speaking it within a
population, but the structures

00:22:40.530 --> 00:22:44.010
that have occurred the fewest
number of times in cultures

00:22:44.010 --> 00:22:46.290
across the planet
are the ones that

00:22:46.290 --> 00:22:48.450
are in cultures where
the languages are

00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:52.570
most readily to be a lost,
some sort of connection there.

00:22:52.570 --> 00:22:54.736
And thus, you've
got some sort of

00:22:54.736 --> 00:22:57.390
weird grammatical
imperialism that

00:22:57.390 --> 00:22:59.130
has emerged over the years.

00:22:59.130 --> 00:23:02.770
Again, what strikes me as a
totally depressing number,

00:23:02.770 --> 00:23:08.280
90% of Earth's languages will
disappear in the next century.

00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:09.830
So now we jump.

00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:11.810
We jump to our next
topic, which was

00:23:11.810 --> 00:23:14.170
our first psychiatric disease.

00:23:14.170 --> 00:23:16.850
And to remind you
from two days ago,

00:23:16.850 --> 00:23:18.780
we're not going to have
a depression lecture.

00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:21.280
The depression chapter
in the zebra's book

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:26.260
will tell all the same stuff in
much better, more clear terms,

00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:27.800
I say, proving my point.

00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:31.400
And what you should do is
read it with as much attention

00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:33.690
to it as if it has
been a lecture subject.

00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:37.200
It is an important
subject, enough hints.

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:38.240
So check that one out.

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:41.640
What we focus on today
though is schizophrenia.

00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:44.400
And we're going to take
our same old strategy,

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:47.360
starting off with what
is the disease look like.

00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:50.270
And as you will see, all
sorts of surprises in there,

00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:52.520
and then what goes
on in the brain

00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:56.700
just before early development,
prenatal, genes, evolution,

00:23:56.700 --> 00:23:57.762
the whole deal there.

00:23:57.762 --> 00:23:59.935
We know this drill once again.

00:23:59.935 --> 00:24:03.010
So starting off, making
sense of schizophrenia,

00:24:03.010 --> 00:24:04.720
as a bunch of
behaviorists, you've

00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:07.270
got a challenge right
off the bat, which

00:24:07.270 --> 00:24:11.290
is lots of people use the word
schizophrenic in an every day

00:24:11.290 --> 00:24:13.990
sense that has no
resemblance whatsoever

00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:15.760
to its actual technical use.

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:18.940
Schizophrenic, or schizian--
we all know that one.

00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:22.660
We've thought, my God, I am
having such a schizi day.

00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:25.910
I overslept, I missed my
first class, it was terrible.

00:24:25.910 --> 00:24:27.790
I totally screwed up,
but then I found out

00:24:27.790 --> 00:24:29.474
I got this great
grade on a midterm,

00:24:29.474 --> 00:24:31.140
but then I had this
fight with a friend,

00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:33.181
but then in the afternoon,
and then this crashed,

00:24:33.181 --> 00:24:34.000
and, blah, blah.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.190
God, what a schizoid
day I'm having.

00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:40.430
No resemblance to how
the term's actually used.

00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:43.570
That's not any sort of
real term in psychiatry.

00:24:43.570 --> 00:24:46.440
Whatever the schizi
days are that we all

00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:48.630
experience now and
then, schizophrenia

00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:50.030
is something else.

00:24:50.030 --> 00:24:53.020
On the most technical
level, schizophrenia

00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:57.020
is a disease of people where,
when you start talking to them,

00:24:57.020 --> 00:24:58.880
within two or three
sentences, you

00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:02.090
realize there's something
strange with their thinking.

00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:04.360
They're not thinking normally.

00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:06.540
They're not
communicating normally.

00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:10.740
On the most fundamental level,
that's what the disease is.

00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:14.830
Obviously, far more precise
than that, schizophrenia,

00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:17.200
disease of thought
disorder, disease

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:19.730
of inappropriate
emotion, disease

00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:23.170
of inappropriate attribution
of things, and what you'll see

00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:28.020
is this is not just some sort
of generic craziness in the way

00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:30.180
that that word means
nothing whatsoever.

00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:33.950
There are typical structures
to the ways in which things

00:25:33.950 --> 00:25:36.910
are not working right in the
behavior of schizophrenics,

00:25:36.910 --> 00:25:39.200
which we'll hear about in a bit.

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:41.050
Part of what begins
to bring that across

00:25:41.050 --> 00:25:43.900
is the obvious fact
that there's no way

00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:46.640
that schizophrenia
is just one disease,

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:48.980
because there's all
sorts of subtypes.

00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:51.730
It is a bunch of
heterogeneous diseases.

00:25:51.730 --> 00:25:55.030
You have a subtype
paranoid schizophrenia,

00:25:55.030 --> 00:25:58.630
where what it's all about
is thought disorder built

00:25:58.630 --> 00:26:00.572
around a sense of persecution.

00:26:00.572 --> 00:26:03.220
You have catatonic
schizophrenia,

00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:05.550
where the person is
in a frozen state,

00:26:05.550 --> 00:26:07.990
immobile for long
periods of time.

00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:10.630
You have schizoaffective
disorders,

00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:13.620
which is kind of a mixture of
schizophrenia and depression

00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:14.510
disorders.

00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:16.040
It's not just one disease.

00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:19.200
So the whole array of
behavioral symptoms

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:21.500
we're going to look at
now, remember, some of them

00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:23.920
are more common in different
subtypes than others.

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:26.880
This is just the
first broad overpass.

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:29.280
So beginning to make
sense of the disease, what

00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:32.080
it is, above all
else, is a disease

00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:37.400
of cognitive abnormalities, of
abnormal sequential thought.

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:41.890
And the term that's given
for it is loose associations.

00:26:41.890 --> 00:26:45.990
All of us can tell a story where
we have a pretty good ability

00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:49.330
to put it sequentially and
have the facts go in a way

00:26:49.330 --> 00:26:52.080
where it will make sense
to any other listener.

00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:55.900
You do not see this
in schizophrenics.

00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:59.060
Sequential thinking
is greatly impaired.

00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:03.030
And instead of having logical
sequences of information

00:27:03.030 --> 00:27:06.920
that they give, things
tangent all over the place,

00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:10.720
bouncing around all over,
where, in retrospect, you

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:13.040
can kind of see how
they might have gotten

00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:16.050
from A to Z, although most
people would have gone

00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:19.660
from A to B at that point,
the tangential thinking

00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:24.070
being another term for it,
the loose associations.

00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:26.430
So what do you wind
up seeing there?

00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:29.120
You get schizophrenics,
for example,

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:31.690
who get terribly
confused in a sentence,

00:27:31.690 --> 00:27:34.280
whether when they are
hearing about boxers,

00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:37.650
they are unable to keep
straight within one sentence

00:27:37.650 --> 00:27:40.590
to separate out whether
they're talking about a dog

00:27:40.590 --> 00:27:43.150
or they're talking
about an occupation.

00:27:43.150 --> 00:27:46.540
Because they slip back
and forth between the two.

00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:50.200
Confusion between
being a caddy, a caddy,

00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:55.830
someone who a golf whatever,
and a Cadillac, short term

00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:56.780
for that.

00:27:56.780 --> 00:27:59.960
All sorts of ways in
which they can't hold on

00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:01.510
to the sequential logic.

00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:04.190
And, instead, there's
just this tangenting,

00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:07.330
getting caught up in
the loose associations.

00:28:07.330 --> 00:28:10.100
You're talking about a boxer,
if you were a schizophrenic,

00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:11.920
you were talking about
a particular boxer,

00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:14.970
you follow that sport
whatever, and, suddenly,

00:28:14.970 --> 00:28:16.680
you are expressing
an opinion about how

00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:20.600
that person would do in a
ring against a St. Bernard.

00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:22.590
And you're often
talking about dogs

00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:26.500
from there, just getting
caught by a loose association

00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:29.590
between the sound of the word
and its multiple meanings,

00:28:29.590 --> 00:28:33.930
going off the tracks on that,
so the loose associations.

00:28:33.930 --> 00:28:36.730
Next, you have a
trouble, consistent one,

00:28:36.730 --> 00:28:38.720
with abstraction.

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:41.370
All of us have a pretty
good intuitive sense,

00:28:41.370 --> 00:28:43.220
when someone is
telling us a story,

00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:47.290
is this meant to be
literal reporting of events

00:28:47.290 --> 00:28:51.070
in a sequential way, is
this meant to be a parable,

00:28:51.070 --> 00:28:54.420
is this meant to be a
somewhat secondhand,

00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:56.120
through the grapevine story.

00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:59.680
We have a very good
sense of how concrete

00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:03.110
or how abstract the information
that we're getting is.

00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:06.040
Schizophrenics are
terrible at that.

00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:10.830
They have no intuition to get
the right level of abstraction.

00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:14.230
And schizophrenics always
skew in the same direction,

00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:18.200
which is to interpret
things far more concretely

00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:19.800
than is actually the case.

00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:23.100
And that's the term that's used
in the business, concreteness

00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:27.690
of thought, which is having a
lot of trouble doing the more

00:29:27.690 --> 00:29:29.990
abstract process
of seeing things

00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:33.580
on a metaphorical level,
things of that sort.

00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:35.290
So here, here's the
standard sort of test

00:29:35.290 --> 00:29:37.831
you would give to someone if
you think they're schizophrenic.

00:29:37.831 --> 00:29:39.530
You give them an
association task.

00:29:39.530 --> 00:29:41.390
And you say something
like, OK, can you

00:29:41.390 --> 00:29:42.930
tell me what do
these things have

00:29:42.930 --> 00:29:47.050
in common, an apple, an
orange, and a banana.

00:29:47.050 --> 00:29:52.020
And they'll say all of them
are multi-syllabic words.

00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:54.020
You'll say, OK, well,
that's great, that's true.

00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:56.550
But anything else
they have in common?

00:29:56.550 --> 00:30:00.020
All of them have letters that
involved closed loops, just

00:30:00.020 --> 00:30:03.640
getting caught up in the
most concrete possible level

00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:07.900
of interpretations of it,
not able to step back and do

00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:09.920
any sort of abstracting.

00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:12.520
You see this in all
sorts of other ways.

00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:16.580
Therapist role, meet the patient
and say something like so

00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:18.560
what's on your mind
today, and they'll

00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:22.990
say my hair in this very
literal sort of way.

00:30:22.990 --> 00:30:26.400
Or you'll say can I take your
picture, holding a camera,

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:29.230
and they'll say, I don't
have a picture to give you,

00:30:29.230 --> 00:30:31.440
this very literal sense again.

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:34.190
Or things like you would
sit down a schizophrenic

00:30:34.190 --> 00:30:36.660
with a piece of paper
and a pen and say, just

00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:38.270
as part of what
we're doing here,

00:30:38.270 --> 00:30:43.405
can you write a sentence
for me, any sentence.

00:30:43.405 --> 00:30:44.780
And then you look
at what they've

00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:48.564
written which is a sentence
for me, any sentence.

00:30:48.564 --> 00:30:50.480
And then you say, no,
no, no, actually, that's

00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:51.320
not what I mean.

00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:53.620
I mean can you come
up with a sentence.

00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:56.660
And when you've thought of
that sentence, write it.

00:30:56.660 --> 00:30:59.860
And they'll write the word
it because they can't get out

00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:04.320
of the concreteness of saying
could you write a sentence, can

00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:07.360
you write colon a sentence.

00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:10.920
They're caught up in the
concrete level of that.

00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:12.940
A way that that
always pops up, one

00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:15.560
of the classic types
of tests that's done,

00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:17.780
is called proverb tests.

00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:21.290
Proverbs, by definition,
they are metaphorical.

00:31:21.290 --> 00:31:23.470
They are parables,
they are abstract.

00:31:23.470 --> 00:31:26.130
And we all know
intuitively that when

00:31:26.130 --> 00:31:28.850
you're talking about birds
of a feather flock together,

00:31:28.850 --> 00:31:33.210
you're doing something symbolic
about the well-known homogamy

00:31:33.210 --> 00:31:37.760
of lips with people who
they choose to marry

00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:38.796
and the similarities.

00:31:38.796 --> 00:31:40.420
Yes, birds of a
feather flock together,

00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:43.430
it's talking about like
tend to assort with like.

00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:46.310
Give proverbs to
schizophrenics and they

00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:49.170
can't get out of the
most concrete level

00:31:49.170 --> 00:31:50.630
of interpretation of it.

00:31:50.630 --> 00:31:52.700
So you're sitting down
and you say, OK, tell me

00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:53.810
what this means.

00:31:53.810 --> 00:31:56.350
A rolling stone gathers no moss.

00:31:56.350 --> 00:31:59.200
And we all know that that's
people are on the move,

00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:00.870
don't make an
emotional connections,

00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:02.250
there is a detachment.

00:32:02.250 --> 00:32:09.590
And they're often saying stones,
stones rolling down hills,

00:32:09.590 --> 00:32:12.150
it's very hard for
plants to grow on them.

00:32:12.150 --> 00:32:15.420
It's very hard because the
surface tends to be smooth.

00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:17.340
And then on top of
it, if it's rolling,

00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:20.080
you've got like this angular
motion that move to it.

00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:23.210
So it's very hard for
moss to grow on stones.

00:32:23.210 --> 00:32:25.640
In fact, I don't think
I've ever seen that happen.

00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:27.130
And I've seen many stones.

00:32:27.130 --> 00:32:30.390
And on the most
concrete possible level,

00:32:30.390 --> 00:32:34.520
incapable of pulling it back
to the level of abstraction.

00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:37.400
Consistent, consistent
feature of this.

00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:39.450
Here, friend of mine
who's a psychiatrist

00:32:39.450 --> 00:32:43.120
came up with what has to be one
of the all-time great proverb

00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:44.910
tests for figuring
out if someone

00:32:44.910 --> 00:32:47.630
has the remotest tendency
towards schizophrenic

00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:48.810
concreteness.

00:32:48.810 --> 00:32:53.260
There was a abstract
phrase, a proverb,

00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:56.740
that was very popular, that was
very prevalent in the United

00:32:56.740 --> 00:32:58.520
States during World War II.

00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:03.250
It was up on posters and all the
post offices, places like that.

00:33:03.250 --> 00:33:07.840
And it was a way of abstractly
telling people be careful

00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:11.000
the information you put in
letters that you are sending

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.300
off to loved ones
who are off at war

00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:16.420
because it may inadvertently
wind up in the wrong hands

00:33:16.420 --> 00:33:19.830
and could carry information
that could be extremely damaging

00:33:19.830 --> 00:33:21.320
to the war effort.

00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:23.420
Do people know what it is?

00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:26.380
Loose lips sink ships,
loose lips sink ships,

00:33:26.380 --> 00:33:28.240
wonderfully abstract notion.

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:31.080
Try sitting down a
schizophrenic and saying

00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:35.980
what does it mean when you
say loose lips sink ships.

00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:38.010
And, suddenly,
there's this imagery

00:33:38.010 --> 00:33:41.150
of ships being capsized
by big lips coming out

00:33:41.150 --> 00:33:43.110
of the water and
things of that sort

00:33:43.110 --> 00:33:45.780
because it can only be
dealt with on the very

00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:47.860
concrete level.

00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:48.820
What else?

00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:53.510
More symptomatology, delusions,
belief in things that cannot

00:33:53.510 --> 00:33:56.700
be, belief in having
participated in historical

00:33:56.700 --> 00:33:58.560
events that cannot be.

00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:01.330
You're sitting there
interviewing a schizophrenic

00:34:01.330 --> 00:34:03.020
and they suddenly
say have you heard

00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:04.590
of the Great Wall of China.

00:34:04.590 --> 00:34:07.010
And you will say, well,
yes, in fact, I have.

00:34:07.010 --> 00:34:11.239
And they'll say
my idea, my idea.

00:34:11.239 --> 00:34:13.219
The generals came to
me at night with a map

00:34:13.219 --> 00:34:15.550
and I said this
is where it goes.

00:34:15.550 --> 00:34:17.219
This is probably
not what happened.

00:34:17.219 --> 00:34:19.639
Delusional thought,
inserting yourself,

00:34:19.639 --> 00:34:22.630
conversations with people
who no longer exist.

00:34:22.630 --> 00:34:25.659
Related to that is
the paranoia, which,

00:34:25.659 --> 00:34:29.350
of course, is most florid
in paranoid schizophrenia,

00:34:29.350 --> 00:34:30.620
but it is a frequent theme.

00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:34.110
What do apples, oranges,
and bananas have in common?

00:34:34.110 --> 00:34:36.750
They're all wired for sound.

00:34:36.750 --> 00:34:39.040
If the fruit is
listening to you,

00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:41.770
this makes for a rather
disquieting life.

00:34:41.770 --> 00:34:43.440
And almost certainly,
it has something

00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:47.290
to do with if the world is
making so little sense to you,

00:34:47.290 --> 00:34:50.710
it is a world that
is very threatening.

00:34:50.710 --> 00:34:53.770
Along with that, most
famously, perhaps,

00:34:53.770 --> 00:34:58.180
with schizophrenia, is
you get hallucinations.

00:34:58.180 --> 00:35:00.780
Those are the defining features.

00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:03.610
Somebody is trying to figure
out if somebody in an emergency

00:35:03.610 --> 00:35:07.400
room has come in with some sort
of schizophrenic type disorder

00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:10.480
and hear that the
person is hearing voices

00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:14.880
and that pretty much
nails down the diagnosis.

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:18.070
For reasons that are
very poorly understood,

00:35:18.070 --> 00:35:22.780
the vast majority of
hallucinations are auditory.

00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:25.240
However, there's all sorts
of notions with that.

00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:29.060
And one great theory coming from
our own Patrick House, given

00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:32.610
two years ago, which is you get
auditory hallucinations more

00:35:32.610 --> 00:35:34.640
often than visual
ones because we're

00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:37.330
more accustomed to
visual stuff in the world

00:35:37.330 --> 00:35:41.120
having fragmented visions or
seeing it across two mirrors,

00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:42.910
reflections, things
of that sort.

00:35:42.910 --> 00:35:46.820
We are more vulnerable towards
sounds not making sense.

00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:49.610
Vast majority of
hallucinations in schizophrenia

00:35:49.610 --> 00:35:51.880
are auditory hallucinations.

00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:54.780
When we see in a little while
what the neurochemistry is

00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:58.390
of hallucinations, by all
logic, what they should be

00:35:58.390 --> 00:36:03.910
is just random splatters of
noise, and random visual dots,

00:36:03.910 --> 00:36:04.880
and all of that.

00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:07.070
Instead, they're structured.

00:36:07.070 --> 00:36:08.630
They have content.

00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:12.440
People hear voices,
rather than random sound.

00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:15.490
People see very
structured hallucinations,

00:36:15.490 --> 00:36:19.290
sufficiently so that
researchers can even do studies

00:36:19.290 --> 00:36:22.590
as to which are the most common
voices heard by schizophrenics.

00:36:22.590 --> 00:36:25.320
And, no surprise,
in Western cultures,

00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:28.410
forever and ever, the number
one voice on the hit parade

00:36:28.410 --> 00:36:32.660
is that of Jesus, the number two
voice, Satan, the number three,

00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:34.580
typically, whoever
is the head of state

00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:36.210
in the country at that point.

00:36:36.210 --> 00:36:40.260
It's structure to that extent
that you can publish papers

00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:42.800
about what the
hallucinations are like.

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:46.540
There's all sorts of
structure underneath.

00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:49.120
It is not just
disordered thought,

00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:52.620
it's loose associations,
and tangenting,

00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:56.750
and concreteness, and
structured hallucinations.

00:36:56.750 --> 00:36:58.140
What else?

00:36:58.140 --> 00:37:02.020
Another feature of the
schizophrenic symptoms

00:37:02.020 --> 00:37:04.630
is social withdrawal.

00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:06.960
And schizophrenia,
everybody thinks

00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:09.480
of as a disease of
abnormal thought,

00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:13.170
it is a disease of abnormal
social affiliation.

00:37:13.170 --> 00:37:15.770
You look at a-- you
look at a schizophrenic

00:37:15.770 --> 00:37:19.480
in some village in who
knows where in the Amazon,

00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:24.030
or in Bloomington, Indiana, and
this is going to be someone who

00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:27.980
is somewhat ostracized and
socially disconnected, very

00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:28.720
much alone.

00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:32.930
It is not just the disease
of disordered thought.

00:37:32.930 --> 00:37:35.010
More and more
people are realizing

00:37:35.010 --> 00:37:38.970
the core with schizophrenia
is the disordered thought.

00:37:38.970 --> 00:37:40.950
The standard view
has always been

00:37:40.950 --> 00:37:44.170
to hone in on the most florid
feature of the disease.

00:37:44.170 --> 00:37:46.870
Schizophrenia is the disease
where you hallucinate,

00:37:46.870 --> 00:37:48.560
where you hear voices.

00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:53.060
And the vast majority of the
neuropharmacology research

00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:54.880
that's been done out
there on the disease

00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:58.220
is meant to go and cure
the hallucinations.

00:37:58.220 --> 00:38:01.750
But far less responsive
to any of the drugs

00:38:01.750 --> 00:38:04.800
are the tangenting
thought, the concreteness,

00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:06.280
the loose associations.

00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:07.910
More and more
people are thinking

00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:12.680
that that's really at the core
of what the disease is about.

00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:15.260
Couple more features
of it, which

00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:19.610
is the whole world of
the social withdrawal.

00:38:19.610 --> 00:38:21.310
Apathy, what we're
beginning to see

00:38:21.310 --> 00:38:24.720
is a dichotomy in the
business, positive symptoms

00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:28.920
in schizophrenia, paranoia,
loose thoughts hallucination,

00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:29.800
all of that.

00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:32.400
Negative symptoms
of schizophrenia,

00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:35.040
the absence of
social connectedness,

00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:40.460
the absence of affect, a
very flat expressive style.

00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:44.270
Physiologically,
you see some damping

00:38:44.270 --> 00:38:48.010
of autonomic nervous systems in
schizophrenics, so the positive

00:38:48.010 --> 00:38:51.160
and the negative
symptoms of the disease.

00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:55.850
Last a couple of features
of it, one is the notion

00:38:55.850 --> 00:38:57.360
that, of course,
schizophrenia has

00:38:57.360 --> 00:38:59.210
something to do with violence.

00:38:59.210 --> 00:39:03.640
Everybody knows that there is
the scenario lurking out there

00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:05.970
that occurs endless
number of times which

00:39:05.970 --> 00:39:10.350
is you have some psychiatrically
unstable individual turning out

00:39:10.350 --> 00:39:12.680
to have schizophrenia who
winds up doing something

00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:17.140
horribly violent, the danger
of schizophrenics cracking

00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:18.360
and going postal.

00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:21.000
And every now and then,
something like that happens.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.340
20 years ago, there was
a horrifying incident

00:39:23.340 --> 00:39:24.370
at Berkeley.

00:39:24.370 --> 00:39:28.400
A student there who was
schizophrenic and probably

00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:30.850
should not have been there at
the point because he was not

00:39:30.850 --> 00:39:33.570
well-medicated,
something cracked and he

00:39:33.570 --> 00:39:35.660
took a bunch of
Berkeley students,

00:39:35.660 --> 00:39:38.120
women, hostage in
a bar at Berkeley,

00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:42.430
did all sorts of horrific
sexually abusive things there

00:39:42.430 --> 00:39:46.370
before he killed himself
after killing a few of them.

00:39:46.370 --> 00:39:48.860
This is what happens
when something like that

00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:50.590
occurs with a schizophrenic.

00:39:50.590 --> 00:39:52.980
Oh, my God, so we've
got all these people

00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:56.260
running around where that
could be happening any second.

00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:59.760
Schizophrenics are
far less dangerous

00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:02.800
than are normal
individuals in society.

00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:06.830
The rates of violence
are extremely low,

00:40:06.830 --> 00:40:10.310
with one exception,
which is schizophrenics

00:40:10.310 --> 00:40:13.490
being violent and
damaging themselves.

00:40:13.490 --> 00:40:17.020
Self-injury, a huge
feature of schizophrenia,

00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:20.010
part of the delusions, part
of the thought disorder,

00:40:20.010 --> 00:40:23.010
part of the despair, when
every now and then your head

00:40:23.010 --> 00:40:25.600
clears enough to see what
the rest of it is like.

00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:28.500
And there are even
studies as to which

00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:32.050
are the most popular places
in the body that are mutilated

00:40:32.050 --> 00:40:33.210
in schizophrenics.

00:40:33.210 --> 00:40:37.180
Genitals are top on the list,
and going down from there.

00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:40.650
Horrific thing that happened,
also about 20 years ago,

00:40:40.650 --> 00:40:42.900
Columbia Medical
School, and this

00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:44.680
was an individual,
a student there,

00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:47.450
with a history of a lot of
psychiatric instability,

00:40:47.450 --> 00:40:51.080
and schizophrenia, and somewhat
well-controlled with meds.

00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:52.850
And somewhere in
the third year when

00:40:52.850 --> 00:40:56.680
starting the clinical rotations,
the various stressors of it,

00:40:56.680 --> 00:40:58.199
the person kind of unravelled.

00:40:58.199 --> 00:41:00.490
Probably should not have been
there in the first place,

00:41:00.490 --> 00:41:02.770
but, nonetheless, had
a schizophrenic break

00:41:02.770 --> 00:41:06.360
and had withdrawn from med
school and was sitting at home.

00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:08.970
Part of his paranoia,
part of his delusions

00:41:08.970 --> 00:41:11.880
were that he was
satanically possessed.

00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:15.440
And, specifically, the way
Satan was driving him to madness

00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:19.010
was with obsessive
sexual thoughts.

00:41:19.010 --> 00:41:22.400
So being a relatively
well-trained endocrinologist,

00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:25.050
because we know better than
him at this point how it works,

00:41:25.050 --> 00:41:27.890
he decides how do I make
those thoughts go away,

00:41:27.890 --> 00:41:30.190
let me get rid of
my testosterone.

00:41:30.190 --> 00:41:32.800
So he castrated himself.

00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:36.150
But at least being well-trained
in one domain of endocrinology,

00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:37.750
he knew that other
fact we've had

00:41:37.750 --> 00:41:40.860
in here which is that
the adrenal glands also

00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:43.230
make a certain degree
of testosterone.

00:41:43.230 --> 00:41:46.680
And he proceeded to try to
adrenalectomize himself.

00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:49.410
He sterilized with some alcohol.

00:41:49.410 --> 00:41:52.420
He made an incision
with anesthetic.

00:41:52.420 --> 00:41:54.350
He had a mirror
there, angled to be

00:41:54.350 --> 00:41:55.730
able to see what he was doing.

00:41:55.730 --> 00:41:58.820
And at one point, he hit a blood
vessel, which started bleeding.

00:41:58.820 --> 00:42:02.030
And he went to the ER at
Columbia Presbyterian,

00:42:02.030 --> 00:42:06.450
going in there, not saying
to his former classmates,

00:42:06.450 --> 00:42:10.070
oh, my God, guys, can you
help me, look what I've done.

00:42:10.070 --> 00:42:13.557
Saying instead, hi, guys, I'm
trying to take out my adrenals

00:42:13.557 --> 00:42:15.140
and I'm having a
problem here with it,

00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:16.840
can you give me a hand.

00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:19.420
This is very disordered thought.

00:42:19.420 --> 00:42:21.750
This is a very
elegant version of it

00:42:21.750 --> 00:42:26.230
schizophrenic self-injury,
schizophrenic suicide,

00:42:26.230 --> 00:42:28.490
is anything but clean.

00:42:28.490 --> 00:42:30.930
Number one on the list,
genitals, number two

00:42:30.930 --> 00:42:33.680
for women, female
schizophrenics, breasts, number

00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:36.320
three, thighs, on it goes.

00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:39.630
This brings up another
feature of the disease, which

00:42:39.630 --> 00:42:43.620
is, back in the 1960s, when
all sorts of laudable things

00:42:43.620 --> 00:42:46.130
happened along certain
cultural lines,

00:42:46.130 --> 00:42:49.210
there amid that was
one horrifically

00:42:49.210 --> 00:42:51.810
damaging idiotic
thing that emerged

00:42:51.810 --> 00:42:58.070
in psychiatry at the
time, which was a minority

00:42:58.070 --> 00:43:01.320
view in psychiatry, a
lunatic fringe view,

00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:06.970
that, basically,
schizophrenia is not so bad.

00:43:06.970 --> 00:43:11.260
Schizophrenia has all
sorts of hidden blessings.

00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:13.990
And soon, it had
frameworks of things

00:43:13.990 --> 00:43:16.890
like schizophrenia is
the disease of being

00:43:16.890 --> 00:43:18.980
healthy in a crazy world.

00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:22.600
Schizophrenia is the disease of
having insights into life that

00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:23.924
other people can't.

00:43:23.924 --> 00:43:25.715
And psychiatrists at
the time, one of them,

00:43:25.715 --> 00:43:28.310
a man named Ronald
Laing, who became famous

00:43:28.310 --> 00:43:31.160
for this, for arguing
it's not a disease,

00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:34.440
we shouldn't be medicating,
we shouldn't be hospitalizing,

00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:36.780
it's a bunch of blessings.

00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:38.850
And it is even
continued to this day.

00:43:38.850 --> 00:43:41.900
The quote that I put on the
top of the handout, Andrew

00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:45.430
Wild, who is one of the gurus of
sort of complementary medicine,

00:43:45.430 --> 00:43:49.880
and you'll see an absolutely
ridiculous statement

00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:53.040
there along the lines
of the hidden blessings

00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:54.360
of schizophrenia.

00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:56.940
There were movies at
that time, King of Hearts

00:43:56.940 --> 00:44:01.410
was one, very popular
one about somebody having

00:44:01.410 --> 00:44:05.840
to hide from the police or who
knows what, and the asylum,

00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:08.130
and eventually releasing
the schizophrenics who

00:44:08.130 --> 00:44:10.850
were so much saner than
the other people around,

00:44:10.850 --> 00:44:11.660
and heartwarming.

00:44:11.660 --> 00:44:16.440
And all you need to do is be
schizophrenic or know someone

00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:19.650
who is or have a family
member and you will see

00:44:19.650 --> 00:44:21.710
there are no hidden blessings.

00:44:21.710 --> 00:44:24.870
This is not a disease
of hidden compensations

00:44:24.870 --> 00:44:26.790
and more insight into the world.

00:44:26.790 --> 00:44:31.320
This is one of the most horrific
ways that biology can go wrong.

00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:33.350
And one of the best
demonstrations of it

00:44:33.350 --> 00:44:37.020
is half of schizophrenics
attempt suicide.

00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:40.990
And the more often you
have periods of remission,

00:44:40.990 --> 00:44:44.090
the more likely you
are to commit suicide.

00:44:44.090 --> 00:44:46.140
What's the significance of that?

00:44:46.140 --> 00:44:48.650
The more often you
have periods where

00:44:48.650 --> 00:44:51.420
you're clear-headed enough
to see what your life is

00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:53.780
like the rest of the
time, the more likely

00:44:53.780 --> 00:44:55.990
you are to try to kill yourself.

00:44:55.990 --> 00:45:00.530
A disease with no hidden
blessings whatsoever.

00:45:00.530 --> 00:45:03.800
Other features of it,
there's an aging component,

00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:05.230
two different forms.

00:45:05.230 --> 00:45:08.820
First one is as schizophrenics
become older, elderly,

00:45:08.820 --> 00:45:12.830
what you see is the positive
symptoms tend to disappear.

00:45:12.830 --> 00:45:15.540
The hallucinations get
damp, the delusions,

00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:18.970
the loose associations, and
the negative symptomatology

00:45:18.970 --> 00:45:22.990
is what comes to the forefront,
this world of just flat affect

00:45:22.990 --> 00:45:24.650
and withdrawal.

00:45:24.650 --> 00:45:27.370
The other age feature of
it we will hear about it

00:45:27.370 --> 00:45:30.380
in a bit, which is
real defining, which

00:45:30.380 --> 00:45:32.590
is schizophrenia
is a disease where,

00:45:32.590 --> 00:45:34.800
in the vast majority
of the sufferers,

00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:38.720
it has late adolescence,
early adulthood onset.

00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:41.790
It is a disease of
18 year olds who

00:45:41.790 --> 00:45:44.260
come down with a diagnosis
for the first time.

00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:47.180
If you make it to age 30
without schizophrenia,

00:45:47.180 --> 00:45:49.950
you have virtually no
chance of ever having it.

00:45:49.950 --> 00:45:52.966
It is a disease of
adolescent onset.

00:45:52.966 --> 00:45:54.340
And this is going
to fit with two

00:45:54.340 --> 00:45:56.030
things we'll be talking about.

00:45:56.030 --> 00:45:58.940
One is the
epidemiological evidence

00:45:58.940 --> 00:46:01.930
showing that what
schizophrenic attacks-- what

00:46:01.930 --> 00:46:04.930
schizophrenic breaks typically
are at the very beginning

00:46:04.930 --> 00:46:07.750
are in response to
major stressors.

00:46:07.750 --> 00:46:10.410
These are individuals
who have always

00:46:10.410 --> 00:46:13.770
been a little bit odd,
who, in elementary school,

00:46:13.770 --> 00:46:17.900
had imaginary playmates far
later than most other kids did,

00:46:17.900 --> 00:46:20.600
who had all sorts of
periods where they seemed

00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:23.930
not to be paying attention and
lost in their own thoughts, who

00:46:23.930 --> 00:46:27.360
had trouble making
friends, but they were OK.

00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:29.260
They were sort of hanging on.

00:46:29.260 --> 00:46:32.150
And then it was
late in high school

00:46:32.150 --> 00:46:36.720
when they had the car accident,
or the first boyfriend was

00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:39.100
so horrible to them,
or the parent died,

00:46:39.100 --> 00:46:43.710
or whatever the crisis was,
and this person who was just

00:46:43.710 --> 00:46:47.020
sort of holding on, that's
where the dip occurs,

00:46:47.020 --> 00:46:48.750
and that's where it crashes.

00:46:48.750 --> 00:46:51.980
Schizophrenia as an
adolescent onset disease

00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:56.440
where stress plays a
major precipitating role.

00:46:56.440 --> 00:46:59.100
The other piece that
we'll see is the fact

00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:02.070
that schizophrenia almost
certainly is heavily

00:47:02.070 --> 00:47:04.360
anchored in the frontal cortex.

00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:07.870
Frontal cortex, you
remember the frontal cortex.

00:47:07.870 --> 00:47:10.080
Frontal cortex, which
is not fully mature

00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:16.080
until age 25 or so, the last
big burst of frontal maturation,

00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:18.360
late adolescence
or early adulthood,

00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:20.050
we'll see there's
lots of reasons

00:47:20.050 --> 00:47:22.810
to think that schizophrenia
is a disease where,

00:47:22.810 --> 00:47:27.310
around late adolescence,
a fragile, vulnerable

00:47:27.310 --> 00:47:30.700
frontal cortex gets kicked
once too hard with something

00:47:30.700 --> 00:47:31.210
or other.

00:47:31.210 --> 00:47:33.900
And that's one where
the problems emerge.

00:47:33.900 --> 00:47:35.710
A couple of other
features, demography

00:47:35.710 --> 00:47:38.810
in every culture ever
looked at on Earth, 1% to 2%

00:47:38.810 --> 00:47:40.990
of the population
comes down with it,

00:47:40.990 --> 00:47:44.130
no gender differences,
no social economic status

00:47:44.130 --> 00:47:46.720
differences in terms of
who becomes a friend.

00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:50.540
But once you are, there
is the not very surprising

00:47:50.540 --> 00:47:53.410
downward socioeconomic
spiral, which

00:47:53.410 --> 00:47:56.250
is, no surprise, people
who are schizophrenic

00:47:56.250 --> 00:47:59.840
do not make very good CEOs
of large corporations.

00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:01.470
These are the street people.

00:48:01.470 --> 00:48:02.780
These are the homeless.

00:48:02.780 --> 00:48:06.160
The majority of people living
on streets in this country

00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:09.940
are individuals who are
schizophrenic, not alcoholic.

00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:12.780
That is the far more
common thing that you see.

00:48:12.780 --> 00:48:16.510
So a disease of complete
collapse into some of the least

00:48:16.510 --> 00:48:20.260
cared for sort of strata
of society, that is part

00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:22.640
of the demographics as well.

00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:24.686
So that's what the
disease looks like.

00:48:24.686 --> 00:48:26.810
And if you're really thinking
about these symptoms,

00:48:26.810 --> 00:48:29.010
at this point, you
should be jumping out

00:48:29.010 --> 00:48:30.910
of your chair
because of something

00:48:30.910 --> 00:48:35.750
really disturbing about
this collection of symptoms.

00:48:35.750 --> 00:48:37.540
So what is schizophrenia?

00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:41.310
It's a disease of
thinking abnormally.

00:48:41.310 --> 00:48:45.730
This is a disease of thinking
differently from everyone else.

00:48:45.730 --> 00:48:49.160
This is a disease of thinking,
in a way, that everyone

00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:51.240
else thinks isn't right.

00:48:51.240 --> 00:48:55.140
And, suddenly, we are skating on
thin ice of this transitioning

00:48:55.140 --> 00:48:59.550
from a world of neuropsychiatric
disorders and medicine

00:48:59.550 --> 00:49:03.630
into a world of all sorts
of hidden agendas of abuse.

00:49:03.630 --> 00:49:06.400
And psychiatry has
been hand in hand

00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:10.330
in bed with all sorts of
ideologues over the decades,

00:49:10.330 --> 00:49:14.260
over the years, and willing
to hand out diagnoses

00:49:14.260 --> 00:49:17.170
of schizophrenia to
political dissidents,

00:49:17.170 --> 00:49:19.180
to people you want
to get rid of.

00:49:19.180 --> 00:49:23.070
And this is a totally
loaded, loaded diagnosis,

00:49:23.070 --> 00:49:25.620
when, most
fundamentally, this is

00:49:25.620 --> 00:49:27.990
a disease of
everybody else thinks

00:49:27.990 --> 00:49:29.470
you're not thinking normally.

00:49:29.470 --> 00:49:31.270
Because, some of the
time, that describes

00:49:31.270 --> 00:49:34.620
a florid psychiatric disease
that destroys your life.

00:49:34.620 --> 00:49:36.740
And some of the time,
it describes people

00:49:36.740 --> 00:49:38.420
who are just a pain in the ass.

00:49:38.420 --> 00:49:40.050
And some of the
time, it describes

00:49:40.050 --> 00:49:42.630
people who are going to
transform the world by thinking

00:49:42.630 --> 00:49:43.720
differently.

00:49:43.720 --> 00:49:47.000
How can you possibly
approach this disease

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:49.980
in an objective way
rather than it having just

00:49:49.980 --> 00:49:52.460
shot through with ideology?

00:49:52.460 --> 00:49:54.747
And one of the ways in
which this can happen,

00:49:54.747 --> 00:49:56.830
one of the ways where you
get some grounding in it

00:49:56.830 --> 00:50:01.240
is to look at what the disease
appears like in other cultures,

00:50:01.240 --> 00:50:03.910
because you begin to
see the commonalities.

00:50:03.910 --> 00:50:06.260
And this begins to impress
you with the notion

00:50:06.260 --> 00:50:09.500
that there is, in fact, a
core set of dysfunctions

00:50:09.500 --> 00:50:10.740
to the disease.

00:50:10.740 --> 00:50:13.000
So let me tell you
about the one case

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:16.712
of cross-cultural schizophrenia
I have ever been exposed to.

00:50:16.712 --> 00:50:18.920
And I was going to bring
slides, but I couldn't quite

00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:20.440
figure out how to scan them.

00:50:20.440 --> 00:50:22.380
So maybe eight
years from now, I'll

00:50:22.380 --> 00:50:24.260
get together for
that technology.

00:50:24.260 --> 00:50:28.550
But it has to do with the time
I spent in Africa and my nearest

00:50:28.550 --> 00:50:29.330
neighbors.

00:50:29.330 --> 00:50:33.100
Nearest neighbors there are
from a tribe called the Maasai.

00:50:33.100 --> 00:50:35.240
These are nomadic pastoralists.

00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:38.660
And these are not
the folks next door.

00:50:38.660 --> 00:50:40.980
This is as different
of a culture

00:50:40.980 --> 00:50:43.180
as you could find
on this planet.

00:50:43.180 --> 00:50:47.320
Men, around puberty,
boys around puberty

00:50:47.320 --> 00:50:50.220
become warriors, spend the
next 10 years in their warrior

00:50:50.220 --> 00:50:53.260
clans, as we've heard about,
pillaging the neighbors,

00:50:53.260 --> 00:50:56.150
getting killed in
return around age 25.

00:50:56.150 --> 00:50:59.240
As elders, they settle down
and marry their first wife,

00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:00.880
typically a 13 year old.

00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:03.990
And, well, as soon as
they can, add on more.

00:51:03.990 --> 00:51:06.660
This is a culture with,
up until recently,

00:51:06.660 --> 00:51:08.900
a life expectancy in the 30s.

00:51:08.900 --> 00:51:13.520
This is a culture where people
believe in all sorts of things

00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:15.530
that we would view
as being paranormal.

00:51:15.530 --> 00:51:19.260
This is a culture in which
people celebrate events

00:51:19.260 --> 00:51:22.050
by drinking tureens
of cow blood.

00:51:22.050 --> 00:51:25.510
This is a very different
bunch of folks.

00:51:25.510 --> 00:51:27.770
Let me tell you about
the one schizophrenic

00:51:27.770 --> 00:51:29.830
Maasai who I've ever seen.

00:51:29.830 --> 00:51:32.340
And this was about 25 years ago.

00:51:32.340 --> 00:51:37.320
And I was in my camp, which was
a few miles away from this one

00:51:37.320 --> 00:51:38.820
village where I
knew a lot of folks,

00:51:38.820 --> 00:51:40.540
and just sitting there
minding my own business.

00:51:40.540 --> 00:51:41.914
And I had this
one woman in there

00:51:41.914 --> 00:51:46.420
who was my-- closest friend
or whatever in the village.

00:51:46.420 --> 00:51:49.590
And I suddenly see
she is running up

00:51:49.590 --> 00:51:51.500
the mountain with a
bunch of the other women

00:51:51.500 --> 00:51:55.070
from the village in this
completely agitated state.

00:51:55.070 --> 00:51:59.720
They come roaring into my camp,
totally flummoxed and just

00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:02.040
like completely agitated.

00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:05.670
These are people who do not
get agitated over things very

00:52:05.670 --> 00:52:06.430
readily.

00:52:06.430 --> 00:52:08.370
These are people who,
as a puberty right,

00:52:08.370 --> 00:52:11.430
have to go out and kill a
lion or don't come back.

00:52:11.430 --> 00:52:14.430
So when Maasai are getting
all crazed about something,

00:52:14.430 --> 00:52:16.530
this is something worth
paying attention to.

00:52:16.530 --> 00:52:19.300
They're totally crazed and
they're saying somebody

00:52:19.300 --> 00:52:21.870
in the village has done
something very wrong

00:52:21.870 --> 00:52:23.800
and I need to come
and help them.

00:52:23.800 --> 00:52:26.427
It turns out what they wanted
me to do was bring my car.

00:52:26.427 --> 00:52:28.510
That's the way in which I
was going to be helpful.

00:52:28.510 --> 00:52:30.570
So they impressed
me into doing this.

00:52:30.570 --> 00:52:32.540
And we all pile into
the car and started

00:52:32.540 --> 00:52:35.180
driving down and heading
towards the village.

00:52:35.180 --> 00:52:37.220
And as we're getting
there, I'm beginning

00:52:37.220 --> 00:52:39.400
to get some information.

00:52:39.400 --> 00:52:42.680
And what I see is
them telling me

00:52:42.680 --> 00:52:44.980
about a woman in
the village who's

00:52:44.980 --> 00:52:47.790
done something
wildly inappropriate

00:52:47.790 --> 00:52:49.930
and they've had it with her.

00:52:49.930 --> 00:52:52.640
Now, I had been around that
area for about four years,

00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:55.590
at that point, knew most of
the people in that village.

00:52:55.590 --> 00:52:58.810
And this was someone who
I had never encountered.

00:52:58.810 --> 00:53:03.260
A-ha, socially isolated,
living in the back of some hut

00:53:03.260 --> 00:53:07.450
at the far corner of the
village, a first sort of hint.

00:53:07.450 --> 00:53:09.790
So they're describing
to me that she has

00:53:09.790 --> 00:53:11.530
done something inappropriate.

00:53:11.530 --> 00:53:14.310
She has killed a goat.

00:53:14.310 --> 00:53:15.500
You don't do that.

00:53:15.500 --> 00:53:17.790
You don't do that
if you are a woman.

00:53:17.790 --> 00:53:20.030
You don't do that if
it is not a ceremony.

00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:21.950
You don't do it the
way she has done it.

00:53:21.950 --> 00:53:24.800
She has grabbed
somebody's goat and ripped

00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:28.480
its throat open with her teeth
and was now there with a goat.

00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:31.000
And everybody had
had it with her.

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:33.090
So we're driving there
and I'm listening to this,

00:53:33.090 --> 00:53:36.960
and I'm saying, whoa, this
sounds like a psychotic break.

00:53:36.960 --> 00:53:38.720
This is going to be cool.

00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:40.470
This is going to be
really interesting.

00:53:40.470 --> 00:53:43.510
I wonder what it'll be
like to talk to the family

00:53:43.510 --> 00:53:45.660
and find out what the
symptoms have been.

00:53:45.660 --> 00:53:47.920
Or I wonder if she's
going to have any insight.

00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:50.450
It's going to be fascinating
to talk to her about this.

00:53:50.450 --> 00:53:52.200
So I get into the
village, and this person

00:53:52.200 --> 00:53:54.960
I was now planning to have some
good heart to hearts with about

00:53:54.960 --> 00:54:00.950
their tangential thinking, out
comes this huge naked woman

00:54:00.950 --> 00:54:05.400
with a goat in her mouth by the
throat, covered in goat blood,

00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:07.410
and goat urine, and goat shit.

00:54:07.410 --> 00:54:10.730
And this woman gives this
howling yell, charges

00:54:10.730 --> 00:54:12.950
across the village, knocks
me over, and attempts

00:54:12.950 --> 00:54:13.670
to strangle me.

00:54:16.950 --> 00:54:24.550
I'm a normal kind of
guy, normal fantasy life.

00:54:24.550 --> 00:54:28.095
Never once in the darkest
recesses of my mind

00:54:28.095 --> 00:54:31.079
did this strike me as
something that was appealing.

00:54:31.079 --> 00:54:32.620
I'm lying there,
she's throttling me.

00:54:32.620 --> 00:54:35.570
I'm thinking this is how
I'm going to wind up dying.

00:54:35.570 --> 00:54:37.290
My poor parents
are going to have

00:54:37.290 --> 00:54:40.020
to deal with the stigma of this
for the rest of their lives,

00:54:40.020 --> 00:54:42.070
that this is-- he's
done in by someone

00:54:42.070 --> 00:54:44.194
with a goat in her
mouth, and thinking that.

00:54:44.194 --> 00:54:46.610
So, fortunately, everybody
else was much more clear-headed

00:54:46.610 --> 00:54:47.900
and they pull her off me.

00:54:47.900 --> 00:54:50.570
And what they proceed to do
is push her into my Jeep.

00:54:50.570 --> 00:54:54.040
And they pile on top of
her and they say let's go.

00:54:54.040 --> 00:54:58.200
So I collect myself and leap in
and we head off driving there.

00:54:58.200 --> 00:55:02.100
And this woman was floridly
out of control of there.

00:55:02.100 --> 00:55:05.440
But we're driving somewhere.

00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:06.510
Where are we driving?

00:55:06.510 --> 00:55:09.330
We're driving to the nearest
government clinic, which

00:55:09.330 --> 00:55:12.050
was about 25 miles
away and consisted

00:55:12.050 --> 00:55:14.180
of a wood shack
and a nurse there,

00:55:14.180 --> 00:55:16.460
a government nurse, who
as a result of this three

00:55:16.460 --> 00:55:19.200
weeks of training, gave
out malarial medication

00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:21.460
for anything you came
to complain about.

00:55:21.460 --> 00:55:23.400
And what they were
going to do was

00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:26.320
they wanted to get rid of her.

00:55:26.320 --> 00:55:28.875
So we go driving and we
eventually get to this clinic.

00:55:28.875 --> 00:55:32.190
Well, what they proceed to
do is push her into the hut

00:55:32.190 --> 00:55:34.680
and hammer the door closed.

00:55:34.680 --> 00:55:36.180
So I'm sitting
there, at this point,

00:55:36.180 --> 00:55:39.680
saying, OK, well,
we've containment.

00:55:39.680 --> 00:55:41.540
So what do we now?

00:55:41.540 --> 00:55:43.500
Do we-- do we talk to her?

00:55:43.500 --> 00:55:45.864
Does the nurse talk to-- do
we go and get the family?

00:55:45.864 --> 00:55:47.530
What are you-- so I
turned to my friends

00:55:47.530 --> 00:55:48.988
there and say so
what do we do now.

00:55:48.988 --> 00:55:51.460
And they say let's get
the hell out of here,

00:55:51.460 --> 00:55:53.170
showing an important thing.

00:55:53.170 --> 00:55:55.950
Even in a culture as
different from ours,

00:55:55.950 --> 00:55:59.320
nobody has a whole lot of
tolerance for the mentally ill.

00:55:59.320 --> 00:56:01.210
Let's get out of here.

00:56:01.210 --> 00:56:03.690
So they persuade me to go.

00:56:03.690 --> 00:56:06.960
We get into the vehicle and
start the long drive back.

00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:09.710
After a while, the
car's aired out a bit

00:56:09.710 --> 00:56:11.600
and everybody's
calming down a bit.

00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:14.220
And I decide this was wonderful.

00:56:14.220 --> 00:56:16.500
What a marvelous
opportunity to learn

00:56:16.500 --> 00:56:19.710
about some cross-cultural
psychiatry or whatever.

00:56:19.710 --> 00:56:22.230
So I turned to my friend
who's sitting next to me there

00:56:22.230 --> 00:56:26.000
and I say so what do you think
was wrong with that woman.

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:27.550
And she looks at
me as I'm an idiot.

00:56:27.550 --> 00:56:29.410
She says she's crazy.

00:56:29.410 --> 00:56:31.072
And I said, well,
how do you know.

00:56:31.072 --> 00:56:31.770
How do you know?

00:56:31.770 --> 00:56:34.170
And she said she hears voices.

00:56:34.170 --> 00:56:37.060
And I say, ha, you
guys hear voices.

00:56:37.060 --> 00:56:39.510
Maasai hear voices,
they do trance dancing

00:56:39.510 --> 00:56:42.550
before they do sort of these
around the clock cattle runs.

00:56:42.550 --> 00:56:45.190
They hear voices of
ghosts, that sort of thing.

00:56:45.190 --> 00:56:48.670
I say to her what's the
big deal, you hear voices.

00:56:48.670 --> 00:56:50.810
And she says, no, no,
no, it's different.

00:56:50.810 --> 00:56:54.060
Then I say, well, what
else was she doing wrong.

00:56:54.060 --> 00:56:56.300
And she says she killed a goat.

00:56:56.300 --> 00:56:58.620
And I say you guys kill goats.

00:56:58.620 --> 00:57:01.640
But, again, this
wasn't how it's done.

00:57:01.640 --> 00:57:04.600
There is an old longstanding
belief among Maasai men

00:57:04.600 --> 00:57:08.520
that it is very bad luck to
have women observe eating meat,

00:57:08.520 --> 00:57:11.770
so they get to go off on their
own and eat all the goat meat.

00:57:11.770 --> 00:57:13.690
And it's done in a
certain ritualized way.

00:57:13.690 --> 00:57:16.360
You do not kill a goat
if you are a woman,

00:57:16.360 --> 00:57:18.520
if you are a naked,
yelling banshee

00:57:18.520 --> 00:57:21.960
of a woman in the middle of the
village with your bare hands

00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:22.770
and teeth.

00:57:22.770 --> 00:57:24.230
You don't do this.

00:57:24.230 --> 00:57:26.560
So I'm sitting there
and I'm saying, well,

00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:29.390
do you know this-- it's
kind of hard for me

00:57:29.390 --> 00:57:31.190
to tell the difference here.

00:57:31.190 --> 00:57:33.860
And she says, in
the sense, idiot,

00:57:33.860 --> 00:57:38.250
she hears voices
at the wrong time.

00:57:38.250 --> 00:57:41.500
And that's the core,
ultimately, of the objectivity

00:57:41.500 --> 00:57:43.220
that's needed in this disease.

00:57:43.220 --> 00:57:47.030
In order to understand what
counts as abnormal thought,

00:57:47.030 --> 00:57:49.640
you first have
the huge challenge

00:57:49.640 --> 00:57:51.840
of understanding all
the different ways

00:57:51.840 --> 00:57:54.350
that normal thought
can manifest itself.

00:57:54.350 --> 00:57:58.860
And that is a classic problem in
training psychiatrists sitting

00:57:58.860 --> 00:58:01.480
in some inner city
clinic recognizing

00:58:01.480 --> 00:58:03.820
that the amount of
cultural variety there,

00:58:03.820 --> 00:58:06.670
or the different ways in
which you can be normal,

00:58:06.670 --> 00:58:09.780
is extraordinary and
extraordinarily challenging

00:58:09.780 --> 00:58:10.660
at times.

00:58:10.660 --> 00:58:12.875
You are on very
thin ice deciding

00:58:12.875 --> 00:58:15.910
you know what counts
as abnormal thinking

00:58:15.910 --> 00:58:18.030
before you have
a very wide sense

00:58:18.030 --> 00:58:21.760
of what can count as normal.

00:58:21.760 --> 00:58:24.380
So now let's take a
five minute break.

00:58:24.380 --> 00:58:28.340
And all sorts of very
accomplished artists

00:58:28.340 --> 00:58:31.190
over the years who've turned
out to be schizophrenic.

00:58:31.190 --> 00:58:34.440
And schizophrenia is not what
made their creativity possible,

00:58:34.440 --> 00:58:37.180
schizophrenia is what
destroyed their careers.

00:58:37.180 --> 00:58:40.670
Other question is so what
happened to that woman.

00:58:40.670 --> 00:58:44.820
And this was shortly before I
was coming back to the states.

00:58:44.820 --> 00:58:47.447
And it was about nine months
later that I went back there.

00:58:47.447 --> 00:58:49.030
And some point, when
seeing my friend,

00:58:49.030 --> 00:58:51.470
saying whatever
happened to that woman.

00:58:51.470 --> 00:58:55.110
And her response
was, oh, she died.

00:58:55.110 --> 00:58:58.870
Maasai do not like to
stay indoors, she died.

00:58:58.870 --> 00:59:01.710
That's all I ever
found out, once again,

00:59:01.710 --> 00:59:04.490
as different to the culture
on Earth as you can imagine.

00:59:04.490 --> 00:59:09.510
And they are no more tolerant
of the mentally ill than we are.

00:59:09.510 --> 00:59:11.940
So now, beginning the
neurochemistry of it,

00:59:11.940 --> 00:59:13.950
what's going on in
the brain, what's

00:59:13.950 --> 00:59:15.600
going on with brain chemistry?

00:59:15.600 --> 00:59:17.240
And for decades
and decades, there

00:59:17.240 --> 00:59:20.790
has been one dominant model
for schizophrenia, which

00:59:20.790 --> 00:59:25.610
is the dopamine hypothesis,
the notion that somewhere

00:59:25.610 --> 00:59:27.660
in the brain, stay
tuned, there is

00:59:27.660 --> 00:59:32.020
an excess of dopamine
winding up in the synapses.

00:59:32.020 --> 00:59:34.070
What's the evidence for it?

00:59:34.070 --> 00:59:36.420
First off, you do
things like look

00:59:36.420 --> 00:59:41.030
at levels of dopamine breakdown
products in the bloodstream,

00:59:41.030 --> 00:59:43.270
in the urine, in the
cerebral spinal fluid,

00:59:43.270 --> 00:59:47.220
tending to be elevated
in schizophrenics.

00:59:47.220 --> 00:59:50.970
Next, what you see is
the most important fact

00:59:50.970 --> 00:59:53.940
which is all of the
classic drugs that

00:59:53.940 --> 00:59:58.630
work with schizophrenia
block dopamine receptors.

00:59:58.630 --> 01:00:00.940
Anti-psychotic
drugs, neuroleptics,

01:00:00.940 --> 01:00:04.590
Haldol, Thorazine, when,
at some exciting moment

01:00:04.590 --> 01:00:09.000
in the made for TV movie,
where the person has gone mad

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.530
in the ER and someone
yells for a syringe,

01:00:11.530 --> 01:00:13.920
they're yelling for a syringe
of something that will

01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:16.610
block the dopamine receptors.

01:00:16.610 --> 01:00:21.530
If you give schizophrenics
dopamine or some drug that

01:00:21.530 --> 01:00:24.550
activates dopamine
receptors, their symptoms

01:00:24.550 --> 01:00:27.080
get worse, which kind
of makes you wonder who

01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:28.560
approved that kind of study.

01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:30.510
That doesn't sound very logical.

01:00:30.510 --> 01:00:33.720
You look post-mortem at the
brains of schizophrenics

01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:37.470
and there's elevated levels
of dopamine receptors

01:00:37.470 --> 01:00:40.100
in the frontal cortex.

01:00:40.100 --> 01:00:43.650
So we have a whole bunch of
ways that things can go wrong.

01:00:43.650 --> 01:00:46.670
We can have too much
dopamine coming out,

01:00:46.670 --> 01:00:48.010
for some reason or other.

01:00:48.010 --> 01:00:50.700
We can have too many
dopamine receptors,

01:00:50.700 --> 01:00:52.320
enhanced sensitivity.

01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:55.550
We know another possible
way, which is dopamine

01:00:55.550 --> 01:00:58.630
is then broken down
by this is enzyme.

01:00:58.630 --> 01:01:01.580
And if this enzyme
isn't working very well,

01:01:01.580 --> 01:01:03.580
levels are going to accumulate.

01:01:03.580 --> 01:01:06.200
And there's a bit of
evidence of abnormalities

01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:09.810
of this enzyme in
some individuals.

01:01:09.810 --> 01:01:11.630
So one additional
interesting piece

01:01:11.630 --> 01:01:13.960
of evidence for this
dopamine hypothesis,

01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:15.777
which seemed absolutely
clear by now,

01:01:15.777 --> 01:01:17.360
you have somebody
who's schizophrenic,

01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:20.160
you give them a drug that
blocks dopamine receptors

01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:23.190
and thus decreases the
dopaminergic signaling,

01:01:23.190 --> 01:01:25.030
and they start getting better.

01:01:25.030 --> 01:01:27.260
What's your
hypothesis have to be?

01:01:27.260 --> 01:01:29.810
I bet you they had
too much dopamine.

01:01:29.810 --> 01:01:32.580
This is shown in
another interesting way.

01:01:32.580 --> 01:01:35.000
18 counties over in
the brain from where

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:36.853
dopamine's got something
to do with this,

01:01:36.853 --> 01:01:39.100
dopamine serves another role.

01:01:39.100 --> 01:01:42.790
In a motor system related
to the basal ganglia, all

01:01:42.790 --> 01:01:46.810
of that, involved in fine motor
control, a part of the brain

01:01:46.810 --> 01:01:48.820
called the substantia nigra.

01:01:48.820 --> 01:01:51.020
And if you get a little
bit of damage there,

01:01:51.020 --> 01:01:53.340
I think I mentioned
a couple extras ago,

01:01:53.340 --> 01:01:55.610
you get the tremor of old age.

01:01:55.610 --> 01:01:57.740
If you get a lot
of damage there,

01:01:57.740 --> 01:02:00.300
you got yourself
Parkinson's disease.

01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:02.210
And what occurs
in Parkinson's is

01:02:02.210 --> 01:02:06.760
90% of the neurons in
the substantia nigra die.

01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:09.420
And people are even
beginning to understand why.

01:02:09.420 --> 01:02:11.860
These are dopaminergic neurons.

01:02:11.860 --> 01:02:15.620
Parkinson's is a disease
of losing all the dopamine

01:02:15.620 --> 01:02:18.330
signaling in this
part of the brain.

01:02:18.330 --> 01:02:20.570
People began to figure
this out in the early '60s.

01:02:20.570 --> 01:02:23.790
And out of that came one of
the first drug treatments

01:02:23.790 --> 01:02:25.610
for any neurological disease.

01:02:25.610 --> 01:02:26.930
What's the strategy?

01:02:26.930 --> 01:02:28.800
These are people
who have too little

01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:31.230
dopamine in this
part of the brain.

01:02:31.230 --> 01:02:33.559
Give them replacement dopamine.

01:02:33.559 --> 01:02:35.600
Turns out it's hard to
get dopamine in the brain,

01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:38.330
so you would give
people one step earlier

01:02:38.330 --> 01:02:42.125
in the biosynthesis
a drug called L-DOPA.

01:02:42.125 --> 01:02:44.940
L-DOPA, which then gets
converted into dopamine,

01:02:44.940 --> 01:02:47.800
and this was miraculous.

01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:50.200
All sorts of people
who were just

01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:53.240
paralysed with their
Parkinson's, L-DOPE

01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:55.070
suddenly liberated them.

01:02:55.070 --> 01:02:58.675
There's a movie 15
years ago or so,

01:02:58.675 --> 01:03:01.390
called Awakenings
with Robin Williams,

01:03:01.390 --> 01:03:03.470
which was based on a
book by Oliver Sacks,

01:03:03.470 --> 01:03:05.590
based on his own
work, which had to do

01:03:05.590 --> 01:03:09.380
with this rare disease that
emerged after World War I,

01:03:09.380 --> 01:03:12.840
having something to do with
the influenza pandemic, then

01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:16.440
a post-encephalitic
paralysis, which became

01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:19.260
known as stiff man syndrome.

01:03:19.260 --> 01:03:22.010
And people who were
essentially frozen in place,

01:03:22.010 --> 01:03:25.320
and what we now know is it's
an autoimmune disorder that

01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:27.660
targets something with
the dopamine system.

01:03:27.660 --> 01:03:31.240
Sacks was a medical resident at
the time, was-- at that point,

01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:34.260
the L-DOPA stuff was just
coming out with Parkinson's.

01:03:34.260 --> 01:03:36.850
And Sacks was the one
who had the insight

01:03:36.850 --> 01:03:39.860
to say I bet the
stiff man syndrome is

01:03:39.860 --> 01:03:43.970
a case of the most extreme
severe Parkinson's that you

01:03:43.970 --> 01:03:45.010
could possibly get.

01:03:45.010 --> 01:03:47.600
And, thus, he was the first
one to try L-DOPA on people

01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:51.690
with the syndrome, and thus
you had miraculous awakenings,

01:03:51.690 --> 01:03:55.060
people moving voluntarily for
the first time in decades,

01:03:55.060 --> 01:03:57.490
totally amazing.

01:03:57.490 --> 01:03:59.320
But then, you have a downside.

01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:01.360
And the downside
that we know sort

01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:03.000
of the structure
of by now, you've

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:06.970
got a problem with dopamine
in the substantia nigra,

01:04:06.970 --> 01:04:09.210
lower than normal levels.

01:04:09.210 --> 01:04:12.330
Everywhere else in the brain,
you've got normal levels.

01:04:12.330 --> 01:04:14.510
So you're trying to
fix up this depletion,

01:04:14.510 --> 01:04:16.780
you give the person L-DOPA.

01:04:16.780 --> 01:04:20.120
But you're not spritzing it
into their substantia nigra,

01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:22.900
you're putting it in their
stomach or their bloodstream.

01:04:22.900 --> 01:04:27.070
You are raising dopamine
levels in the substantia nigra

01:04:27.070 --> 01:04:29.580
and things get better,
but you're also raising it

01:04:29.580 --> 01:04:31.880
everywhere else in the brain.

01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:36.140
And what you wind up seeing
is if you give a Parkinsonian

01:04:36.140 --> 01:04:40.420
patient too much L-DOPA,
they become psychotic.

01:04:40.420 --> 01:04:43.960
They are indistinguishable
from a schizophrenic.

01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:46.670
And what was shown in the
movie was this character

01:04:46.670 --> 01:04:48.580
played by Robert
De Niro wound up

01:04:48.580 --> 01:04:53.110
having this florid paranoid
psychosis from the L-DOPA,

01:04:53.110 --> 01:04:55.170
so, oh, that being
more evidence,

01:04:55.170 --> 01:04:58.070
you give a drug that
raises dopamine levels

01:04:58.070 --> 01:04:59.970
throughout the
brain and somebody

01:04:59.970 --> 01:05:02.170
starts acting schizophrenic.

01:05:02.170 --> 01:05:06.020
You give somebody a drug that
causes very rapid dumping

01:05:06.020 --> 01:05:08.790
of dopamine, and
they will transiently

01:05:08.790 --> 01:05:10.110
appear schizophrenic.

01:05:10.110 --> 01:05:11.090
What's the drug?

01:05:11.090 --> 01:05:13.110
That's what amphetamines do.

01:05:13.110 --> 01:05:17.060
And you get somebody coming to
an ER who is loose associations

01:05:17.060 --> 01:05:19.350
and hallucinating
delusions and all of that,

01:05:19.350 --> 01:05:22.900
and most clinicians cannot tell
whether this was somebody with

01:05:22.900 --> 01:05:25.270
an amphetamine psychosis
or schizophrenia.

01:05:25.270 --> 01:05:26.620
Pump their stomach out.

01:05:26.620 --> 01:05:28.950
If they suddenly start
making more sense,

01:05:28.950 --> 01:05:31.060
it was probably
the amphetamines.

01:05:31.060 --> 01:05:33.000
So this being more evidence.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:36.260
Now, you should be thinking
what about the flip side.

01:05:36.260 --> 01:05:39.030
So you have schizophrenics,
where you give them

01:05:39.030 --> 01:05:43.070
these neuroleptic drugs to
block dopamine receptors

01:05:43.070 --> 01:05:44.794
in the frontal cortex,
as it turns out.

01:05:44.794 --> 01:05:46.710
But you're not injecting
it straight in there,

01:05:46.710 --> 01:05:47.835
you're putting in the guts.

01:05:47.835 --> 01:05:50.120
And, now, you've got
too much dopamine here.

01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:53.000
You lower its levels,
but everywhere else it

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.410
gets a little lower than
normal-- not dopamine levels,

01:05:55.410 --> 01:05:56.910
but dopamine signaling.

01:05:56.910 --> 01:05:59.840
And, suddenly, you should
generate this prediction

01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:02.430
that if you over
medicate schizophrenics,

01:06:02.430 --> 01:06:05.370
they should start looking as if
they have Parkinson's disease.

01:06:05.370 --> 01:06:07.930
And that's exactly
what you see as well,

01:06:07.930 --> 01:06:12.010
a disorder called tardive
dyskinesia, kinetics,

01:06:12.010 --> 01:06:14.240
body movement
dyskinesia, abnormal one.

01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:17.810
And these are individuals
who look Parkinsonian.

01:06:17.810 --> 01:06:20.920
Go into a state hospital,
go into the back ward,

01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:22.500
and find somebody
sitting there who

01:06:22.500 --> 01:06:25.625
is tremoring like this all over
their body the entire time.

01:06:25.625 --> 01:06:27.000
And that's somebody
who was going

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:30.830
to have been taking these
drugs for 20, 25 years or so.

01:06:30.830 --> 01:06:33.840
So, collectively, this
winds up telling you

01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:36.460
all these different ways
of suggesting the problem

01:06:36.460 --> 01:06:41.760
is that there is too much
dopamine in this disease.

01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:43.990
However, just to
make life miserable,

01:06:43.990 --> 01:06:46.850
there is at least one
anti-schizophrenic drug

01:06:46.850 --> 01:06:51.820
out there which what it does is
it increases dopamine signaling

01:06:51.820 --> 01:06:53.560
and people get better.

01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:57.260
Bummer, nobody knows what to
make of this at this point.

01:06:57.260 --> 01:06:59.850
So what's the excess
dopamine doing in there?

01:06:59.850 --> 01:07:02.220
It's not having anything
to do with movement stuff.

01:07:02.220 --> 01:07:03.570
That's substantia nigra.

01:07:03.570 --> 01:07:05.950
It's not having anything
to do with pleasure.

01:07:05.950 --> 01:07:08.370
That's dopamine in different
parts of the brain.

01:07:08.370 --> 01:07:11.040
The best evidence
is this is dopamine

01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:13.240
functioning in the
frontal cortex,

01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:16.760
stimulating normal
executive function.

01:07:16.760 --> 01:07:19.060
And what you've got
is a frontal cortex

01:07:19.060 --> 01:07:21.240
that is not making a
whole lot of sense.

01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:23.650
Loose associations,
that seems to be

01:07:23.650 --> 01:07:27.070
where the dopamine
problem is played out.

01:07:27.070 --> 01:07:29.530
Next neurotransmitter
that's been implicated,

01:07:29.530 --> 01:07:33.590
serotonin, look at the chemical
structure of serotonin,

01:07:33.590 --> 01:07:36.030
and then look at the
chemical structure of all

01:07:36.030 --> 01:07:40.770
of the major hallucinogens,
LSD, mescaline, psilocybin,

01:07:40.770 --> 01:07:43.860
they are all structurally
almost identical.

01:07:43.860 --> 01:07:48.570
And all of those hallucinogens
fit into serotonin receptors

01:07:48.570 --> 01:07:50.650
and activate them.

01:07:50.650 --> 01:07:53.550
What is a hallucination
induced by a drug?

01:07:53.550 --> 01:07:55.340
You've got some
serotonin synapse

01:07:55.340 --> 01:07:57.220
where nothing's happening.

01:07:57.220 --> 01:07:58.930
The pre-synaptic
neuron hasn't had

01:07:58.930 --> 01:08:00.640
anything interesting
to say in weeks,

01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:02.420
it hasn't released
any serotonin.

01:08:02.420 --> 01:08:05.780
But, now, there's something that
kind of looks like serotonin

01:08:05.780 --> 01:08:09.530
percolating its way into the
synapse, where it could then

01:08:09.530 --> 01:08:12.200
bind to the serotonin receptors.

01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:14.200
And as far as this
neuron thinks,

01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:16.340
it just got a
message from there.

01:08:16.340 --> 01:08:18.200
And it didn't come from there.

01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:20.880
This neuron is hearing voices.

01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:24.149
And the fact that that's how the
hallucinogens work immediately

01:08:24.149 --> 01:08:26.380
generated all
sorts of hypotheses

01:08:26.380 --> 01:08:29.970
that there are abnormalities
in serotonin in schizophrenia

01:08:29.970 --> 01:08:33.930
as well having something to
do with the hallucinations.

01:08:33.930 --> 01:08:36.680
Next, the
neurotransmitter glutamate

01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:38.260
has also been implicated.

01:08:38.260 --> 01:08:40.140
What's the evidence there?

01:08:40.140 --> 01:08:43.060
When you take a drug
that wildly stimulates

01:08:43.060 --> 01:08:45.830
one subtype of
glutamate receptor,

01:08:45.830 --> 01:08:49.470
you begin to look a bit
like a schizophrenic.

01:08:49.470 --> 01:08:50.630
What's the drug?

01:08:50.630 --> 01:08:53.880
PCP, angel dust, phencyclidine.

01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:57.029
That stimulates a subtype
of glutamate receptors.

01:08:57.029 --> 01:08:59.580
And a lot of people
have argued this

01:08:59.580 --> 01:09:02.700
has enough resemblance to
what schizophrenia looks like

01:09:02.700 --> 01:09:05.439
that there has to be a
glutamate problem going on

01:09:05.439 --> 01:09:06.430
in the disease.

01:09:06.430 --> 01:09:08.740
Very, very little
bits of evidence

01:09:08.740 --> 01:09:11.930
for that, the one thing
that has been shown in rats

01:09:11.930 --> 01:09:16.029
is when you stimulate
the brain with PCP,

01:09:16.029 --> 01:09:19.220
what you get is an increased
levels of receptors

01:09:19.220 --> 01:09:22.680
for serotonin in some
interesting parts of the brain,

01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:25.720
some kind of connection
running around there.

01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:30.060
So very, very solid implication
of dopamine, some serotonin

01:09:30.060 --> 01:09:32.529
thrown in there,
glutamate, eleventy other

01:09:32.529 --> 01:09:34.830
neurotransmitters that
people are thinking about,

01:09:34.830 --> 01:09:36.439
but these are the main ones.

01:09:36.439 --> 01:09:39.180
And, overwhelmingly,
the dominant hypothesis

01:09:39.180 --> 01:09:41.670
remains the dopamine hypothesis.

01:09:41.670 --> 01:09:43.800
What about brain metabolism?

01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:45.910
What's going on in the
brain, for example,

01:09:45.910 --> 01:09:48.250
during a hallucination?

01:09:48.250 --> 01:09:51.529
And what you essentially
get is wild activation

01:09:51.529 --> 01:09:55.340
of everywhere in the brain
and you are hallucinating.

01:09:55.340 --> 01:09:59.420
You get wild activation, people
who are in imaging studies

01:09:59.420 --> 01:10:01.910
have taken these
drugs voluntarily,

01:10:01.910 --> 01:10:04.630
you get wild activation
in the cortex,

01:10:04.630 --> 01:10:06.700
except for, say,
the first couple

01:10:06.700 --> 01:10:09.950
layers of the visual cortex,
or the first couple of layers

01:10:09.950 --> 01:10:11.420
of the auditory cortex.

01:10:11.420 --> 01:10:12.860
What's that about?

01:10:12.860 --> 01:10:16.380
The cortex is seeing
things and hearing things

01:10:16.380 --> 01:10:18.930
that did not come in from
the outside world, that

01:10:18.930 --> 01:10:22.190
never stimulated the
primary sensory cortex.

01:10:22.190 --> 01:10:24.840
Otherwise, during
hallucinations,

01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:28.340
you see extremely high
levels of metabolism

01:10:28.340 --> 01:10:30.390
throughout the brain.

01:10:30.390 --> 01:10:32.320
The next interesting
thing in that realm,

01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:34.910
you give schizophrenics
some standard declarative

01:10:34.910 --> 01:10:38.570
memory tasks and metabolism
in the hippocampus

01:10:38.570 --> 01:10:42.410
does not increase as much
as in other individuals.

01:10:42.410 --> 01:10:45.170
So that brings us to structural
features of the disease.

01:10:45.170 --> 01:10:46.116
Yeah?

01:10:46.116 --> 01:10:48.954
Does the brain--
while hallucinating,

01:10:48.954 --> 01:10:52.280
does the brain work
somewhat like when dreaming?

01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:52.970
Good question.

01:10:52.970 --> 01:10:55.490
Does the brain, in terms
of patterns of activation,

01:10:55.490 --> 01:10:57.500
look somewhat like
during dreaming?

01:10:57.500 --> 01:10:58.320
Yeah.

01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:02.040
It's not the primary sensory
cortex regions that activate.

01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:04.660
Frontal cortex is
relatively quiet.

01:11:04.660 --> 01:11:07.700
And the rest of the
brain is going like mad,

01:11:07.700 --> 01:11:10.050
and certainly makes sense.

01:11:10.050 --> 01:11:12.660
So structural stuff,
there's all sorts

01:11:12.660 --> 01:11:16.650
of structural abnormalities in
the brains of schizophrenics.

01:11:16.650 --> 01:11:18.360
How do you learn this though?

01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:21.970
Very difficult, because, for
the first couple of decades

01:11:21.970 --> 01:11:26.130
in the field, it was all
post-mortem analysis, which

01:11:26.130 --> 01:11:28.224
is you take out the
brain of a schizophrenic

01:11:28.224 --> 01:11:29.640
and you go and
look at it, and you

01:11:29.640 --> 01:11:31.370
see if there's anything weird.

01:11:31.370 --> 01:11:33.250
So what's the
problems with that?

01:11:33.250 --> 01:11:35.640
All sorts of things,
which is to try

01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:39.290
to do post-mortem studies on
human brains, different brain

01:11:39.290 --> 01:11:40.970
sit for different
lengths of time

01:11:40.970 --> 01:11:43.340
before they're
autopsied and removed.

01:11:43.340 --> 01:11:45.660
So that's a huge
piece of variability.

01:11:45.660 --> 01:11:50.020
Moreover, you can get
post-mortem artifacts,

01:11:50.020 --> 01:11:51.670
which is to say
you're pulling out

01:11:51.670 --> 01:11:54.390
the brain and somebody
squeezes it too hard

01:11:54.390 --> 01:11:56.710
and squishes something
in here and it's not

01:11:56.710 --> 01:12:00.580
going to look normal afterward,
reflecting the handling of it.

01:12:00.580 --> 01:12:03.550
And out of that has
come this whole world

01:12:03.550 --> 01:12:05.930
of neuropsychiatry
types were what they

01:12:05.930 --> 01:12:08.800
live for are rapid autopsies.

01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:10.750
And a whole bunch
of medical centers

01:12:10.750 --> 01:12:12.920
have rapid autopsy
teams connected

01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:15.460
with their Alzheimer's
folk, connected

01:12:15.460 --> 01:12:17.230
with some of the
psychiatric diseases,

01:12:17.230 --> 01:12:20.130
where their idea is to
get in there as fast

01:12:20.130 --> 01:12:22.940
as possible with
patients who have

01:12:22.940 --> 01:12:25.730
or whose family have
given permission for that

01:12:25.730 --> 01:12:28.254
and get the brain out
as fast as you can.

01:12:28.254 --> 01:12:29.670
And I remember, a
few years ago, I

01:12:29.670 --> 01:12:31.830
was down to Duke
Medical Center, and they

01:12:31.830 --> 01:12:34.940
had one of these rapid
autopsy SWAT teams.

01:12:34.940 --> 01:12:37.600
And they were bragging about
how they were getting brains out

01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:40.190
in under 30 minutes from death.

01:12:40.190 --> 01:12:44.880
So that solves a whole lot
of the post-mortem rotting

01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:46.900
away lag time.

01:12:46.900 --> 01:12:48.950
So all of those wind
up being problems.

01:12:48.950 --> 01:12:51.160
More confounds,
very often you're

01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:54.430
trying to understand the brains
of schizophrenics who have died

01:12:54.430 --> 01:12:56.690
who are older, who are elderly.

01:12:56.690 --> 01:12:58.850
And the confound there
is schizophrenics

01:12:58.850 --> 01:13:00.920
have horrible diets.

01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:04.040
You are seeing perhaps
the brain consequences

01:13:04.040 --> 01:13:07.120
of malnutrition all those
years, rather than seeing

01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:11.540
the consequences of
the disease itself.

01:13:11.540 --> 01:13:14.390
Another problem that you've
got is you get someone

01:13:14.390 --> 01:13:16.790
who's schizophrenic,
and, almost certainly,

01:13:16.790 --> 01:13:19.910
what they have been doing
for a long time is taking

01:13:19.910 --> 01:13:21.850
drugs for their schizophrenia.

01:13:21.850 --> 01:13:24.790
And if you see something
different in the brain,

01:13:24.790 --> 01:13:26.470
maybe it's due to
the schizophrenia

01:13:26.470 --> 01:13:28.750
or maybe it's due to
the effect of the drugs.

01:13:28.750 --> 01:13:31.060
And what that has generated
is the other thing

01:13:31.060 --> 01:13:33.860
that people in this
business kill for, which

01:13:33.860 --> 01:13:36.510
is unmedicated schizophrenics.

01:13:36.510 --> 01:13:39.520
And researchers
love these people,

01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:41.360
they can't get enough of them.

01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:43.500
This is the teenager
who is brought

01:13:43.500 --> 01:13:46.060
in for the first diagnosis.

01:13:46.060 --> 01:13:49.970
And the family is no doubt
thinking finally we're

01:13:49.970 --> 01:13:50.930
going to get some help.

01:13:50.930 --> 01:13:53.050
And all the researcher
physician there is thinking

01:13:53.050 --> 01:13:55.050
is they want to
centrifuge this kid

01:13:55.050 --> 01:13:57.550
and do research
and find that out,

01:13:57.550 --> 01:14:00.280
getting unmedicated
schizophrenics.

01:14:00.280 --> 01:14:04.270
Finally, a big boon in the
field has been brain imaging.

01:14:04.270 --> 01:14:06.980
So instead of trying to figure
out the normal size of things

01:14:06.980 --> 01:14:08.710
after you've taken
the brain out,

01:14:08.710 --> 01:14:11.390
you could image
the brain in situ,

01:14:11.390 --> 01:14:13.520
while the person is still alive.

01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:16.890
So given all of those
methodological constraints,

01:14:16.890 --> 01:14:19.830
there's a number of
things that have come up.

01:14:19.830 --> 01:14:21.450
Here's a cross-section
of the brain,

01:14:21.450 --> 01:14:24.340
although I'm realizing this is
a cross-section of a rat brain.

01:14:24.340 --> 01:14:27.220
And it also is a amusing face.

01:14:27.220 --> 01:14:29.750
And what you have
are these things

01:14:29.750 --> 01:14:32.590
that run through the brain
called the ventricles.

01:14:32.590 --> 01:14:35.600
They are these caverns
running through, filled

01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:37.540
with cerebral spinal fluid.

01:14:37.540 --> 01:14:42.890
What you see in schizophrenia is
enlargement of the ventricles.

01:14:42.890 --> 01:14:44.210
So the ventricles enlarge.

01:14:44.210 --> 01:14:46.320
The skull isn't going
anywhere, and, thus,

01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:47.990
if the ventricles
are getting bigger,

01:14:47.990 --> 01:14:50.130
something else has to
be getting smaller.

01:14:50.130 --> 01:14:54.070
There is contraction
compression of the cortex.

01:14:54.070 --> 01:14:58.040
So you get cortical
compression in schizophrenics.

01:14:58.040 --> 01:15:01.630
You get it particularly
so in the frontal cortex.

01:15:01.630 --> 01:15:04.340
A-ha, that's kind
of interesting.

01:15:04.340 --> 01:15:08.240
Meanwhile, over in the
hippocampus, what you have,

01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:12.110
normally, are these very
characteristic cell fields,

01:15:12.110 --> 01:15:14.380
where-- I just drew
them wrong, where

01:15:14.380 --> 01:15:17.160
neurons that are called
pyramidal neurons that,

01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:19.355
shockingly, are
pyramidally shaped.

01:15:20.010 --> 01:15:22.360
And what they have is
they're organized in layers.

01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:24.560
And they send all
of their projections

01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:28.670
off to the next cell layer that
happens to be diamond shaped.

01:15:28.670 --> 01:15:30.180
And that's how it works.

01:15:30.180 --> 01:15:32.910
You look in the brains of
schizophrenics post-mortem

01:15:32.910 --> 01:15:35.830
and there's fewer
hippocampal neurons.

01:15:35.830 --> 01:15:41.580
And there's some of them
are facing the wrong way.

01:15:41.580 --> 01:15:42.790
They've been flipped over.

01:15:42.790 --> 01:15:45.600
They're sending projections
where they're not supposed to.

01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:49.060
This is not going to make for
a whole lot of solid sequential

01:15:49.060 --> 01:15:51.030
thought if you've
got neurons pointing

01:15:51.030 --> 01:15:52.320
in the wrong direction.

01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:54.940
So that's popped up
in the literature.

01:15:54.940 --> 01:15:57.910
Then, of course,
frontal cortex, where

01:15:57.910 --> 01:16:02.410
what's been seen as, in
some studies, fewer neurons,

01:16:02.410 --> 01:16:05.930
in some studies, fewer
glia, in some studies,

01:16:05.930 --> 01:16:12.410
fewer of both, what you see is,
also, lower levels of a protein

01:16:12.410 --> 01:16:13.240
called reelin.

01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:18.490
And what reelin has to do
is with cortical maturation.

01:16:18.490 --> 01:16:21.120
There's lower levels of
it in the frontal cortex

01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:22.170
of schizophrenics.

01:16:22.170 --> 01:16:25.460
All of this begins to fit
in this picture of you're

01:16:25.460 --> 01:16:30.190
not getting a normal final
burst of frontal maturation

01:16:30.190 --> 01:16:32.350
late adolescence,
early adulthood.

01:16:32.350 --> 01:16:35.430
You're seeing a lot
of problems there.

01:16:35.430 --> 01:16:36.820
What else?

01:16:36.820 --> 01:16:39.430
You also see a couple
of other minor things.

01:16:39.430 --> 01:16:41.710
The thalamus tends
to be atrophied.

01:16:41.710 --> 01:16:43.640
Nobody really knows
what's going on.

01:16:43.640 --> 01:16:45.970
The sense is
hippocampus pointing

01:16:45.970 --> 01:16:48.450
in the wrong direction,
frontal cortex, that's

01:16:48.450 --> 01:16:51.800
getting compressed, because
it's got fewer neurons perhaps.

01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:55.500
This is not going to
make for a normal brain.

01:16:55.500 --> 01:17:00.110
So now switching one box
back, what about the genetics?

01:17:00.110 --> 01:17:02.212
And you'll notice this is
one of our first topics

01:17:02.212 --> 01:17:03.920
where there's nothing
been happening here

01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:07.790
in terms of endocrine effects,
acute releasers not terribly

01:17:07.790 --> 01:17:09.570
pertinent to this field.

01:17:09.570 --> 01:17:11.010
So what about genetics?

01:17:11.010 --> 01:17:14.890
Going back to all of our classic
behavior genetics approaches,

01:17:14.890 --> 01:17:17.130
this has been the
psychiatric disease

01:17:17.130 --> 01:17:18.900
where there was
the first evidence

01:17:18.900 --> 01:17:21.520
for a genetic component to it.

01:17:21.520 --> 01:17:24.990
The twin studies, the
Kety adoption studies

01:17:24.990 --> 01:17:27.850
that we've heard all about,
and what they have suggested

01:17:27.850 --> 01:17:32.090
was about 50% heritability
for schizophrenia.

01:17:32.090 --> 01:17:35.340
And you are all over now
what heritability means

01:17:35.340 --> 01:17:36.410
and what it doesn't mean.

01:17:36.410 --> 01:17:40.630
What you see within families is
if you have an individual who

01:17:40.630 --> 01:17:43.720
has schizophrenia and they
have an identical twin,

01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:47.140
the twin has a 50%
chance of the disease.

01:17:47.140 --> 01:17:50.110
If they have a full
sibling, about 25%

01:17:50.110 --> 01:17:53.710
chance of a disease,
half sibling, about 12%.

01:17:53.710 --> 01:17:57.630
Take a random person off
the street, 1% to 2%,

01:17:57.630 --> 01:18:00.970
so there is a
large genetic load.

01:18:00.970 --> 01:18:05.870
What you also see is in a
higher than expected number

01:18:05.870 --> 01:18:08.520
of close relatives
of schizophrenics

01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:11.380
are mild versions
of thought disorder.

01:18:11.380 --> 01:18:13.050
And that's going to
come in on Friday

01:18:13.050 --> 01:18:14.890
in a very interesting way.

01:18:14.890 --> 01:18:16.650
What this is saying
right off the bat,

01:18:16.650 --> 01:18:20.490
it is not saying that all
relatives of schizophrenics

01:18:20.490 --> 01:18:23.300
have these abnormalities,
but they are occurring

01:18:23.300 --> 01:18:26.000
at a higher than expected rate.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:30.030
So that's old classical
behavior genetics.

01:18:30.030 --> 01:18:33.560
Now, jumping forward a
decade's worth of technology,

01:18:33.560 --> 01:18:36.960
how about molecular approaches
the version of just getting

01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:38.530
genetic markers?

01:18:38.530 --> 01:18:41.650
Not identifying the gene itself,
but you remember this approach

01:18:41.650 --> 01:18:45.210
by now where you are
finding a stretch of DNA.

01:18:45.210 --> 01:18:47.250
And inside that
stretch is a gene

01:18:47.250 --> 01:18:49.400
that is very pertinent
to whatever it is,

01:18:49.400 --> 01:18:52.930
and the folks with the disease
have a different version

01:18:52.930 --> 01:18:53.990
than the other folks.

01:18:53.990 --> 01:18:56.760
But you don't know what
the gene is or where it is.

01:18:56.760 --> 01:19:00.950
So using this marker technique,
some of the first disease gene

01:19:00.950 --> 01:19:03.910
markers came out in the
mid '80s, late '80s,

01:19:03.910 --> 01:19:05.160
for schizophrenia.

01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:07.190
And these were landmark studies.

01:19:07.190 --> 01:19:10.340
And everybody was incredibly
excited about them.

01:19:10.340 --> 01:19:12.700
And these were really,
really important.

01:19:12.700 --> 01:19:16.200
And there was a problem,
which is somebody

01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:19.910
would isolate a marker
for schizophrenia

01:19:19.910 --> 01:19:22.320
in an Amish population.

01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:25.190
People love studying the
Amish for things like this

01:19:25.190 --> 01:19:27.380
because they've
got big families,

01:19:27.380 --> 01:19:30.080
because they don't have a
whole lot of substance abuse,

01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:32.220
because they have very
healthy lifestyles,

01:19:32.220 --> 01:19:35.800
and, most importantly,
because men, Amish men who

01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:37.990
say they are the father
of somebody or other

01:19:37.990 --> 01:19:40.360
are probably the father
of the somebody or other.

01:19:40.360 --> 01:19:43.306
There's not a lot of
messing around going on.

01:19:43.306 --> 01:19:44.430
And that's kind of helpful.

01:19:44.430 --> 01:19:46.297
You're trying to
understand genetics.

01:19:46.297 --> 01:19:48.380
And if you don't even have
the right person pegged

01:19:48.380 --> 01:19:51.010
as the father, that's going
to make for some messy data.

01:19:51.010 --> 01:19:55.840
People love the Amish, people
love inbred Icelandic fishing

01:19:55.840 --> 01:19:56.900
villages.

01:19:56.900 --> 01:19:58.670
These are all the
folks who get studied.

01:19:58.670 --> 01:20:00.460
And in those years,
out came some

01:20:00.460 --> 01:20:02.550
of the first genetic markers.

01:20:02.550 --> 01:20:05.260
And the problem was
each of the studies

01:20:05.260 --> 01:20:07.470
was getting a different marker.

01:20:07.470 --> 01:20:10.600
And nobody was coming
up with any replication,

01:20:10.600 --> 01:20:13.200
a complete
uninformative mess that

01:20:13.200 --> 01:20:16.400
was a major disappointment
in the field.

01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:20.240
So very little happened in terms
of the genetic marker approach.

01:20:20.240 --> 01:20:23.250
So we had to wait another
decade or two, and, now,

01:20:23.250 --> 01:20:25.350
our current more
modern version, which

01:20:25.350 --> 01:20:29.390
is forget a genetic marker,
what about actual genes?

01:20:29.390 --> 01:20:31.860
Are there are genes that
have been implicated

01:20:31.860 --> 01:20:35.530
in schizophrenia where
there are abnormalities,

01:20:35.530 --> 01:20:37.340
where there are variances?

01:20:37.340 --> 01:20:39.430
And then it comes from
two different flavors,

01:20:39.430 --> 01:20:41.670
eight different
flavors, our usual deal.

01:20:41.670 --> 01:20:43.450
We've already heard
about one of these,

01:20:43.450 --> 01:20:48.420
which is variance in
versions of this gene

01:20:48.420 --> 01:20:52.130
coding for this enzyme that
degrades dopamine carries

01:20:52.130 --> 01:20:55.080
an association
with schizophrenia.

01:20:55.080 --> 01:20:58.380
Nonetheless, very small effects.

01:20:58.380 --> 01:21:01.270
Interesting finding, and
this was the last year,

01:21:01.270 --> 01:21:04.620
these were three papers
back-to-back in science,

01:21:04.620 --> 01:21:07.160
from three different
groups, all of whom

01:21:07.160 --> 01:21:09.940
used a very
contemporary technique

01:21:09.940 --> 01:21:13.270
for looking for genes,
which is a snip analysis.

01:21:13.270 --> 01:21:16.330
And it's really interesting,
and not in a million years

01:21:16.330 --> 01:21:17.840
could I describe it clearly.

01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:19.830
But using this very
state of the art thing,

01:21:19.830 --> 01:21:23.160
they all had huge populations
of schizophrenics,

01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:26.300
thousands of people in
the study, great studies.

01:21:26.300 --> 01:21:28.560
And the amazing
thing is they all

01:21:28.560 --> 01:21:33.190
found genetic abnormalities,
and they all found one in common

01:21:33.190 --> 01:21:37.010
with a huge effect, which
was very, very reassuring,

01:21:37.010 --> 01:21:39.410
until you looked at
that the gene, which

01:21:39.410 --> 01:21:41.782
made no sense at all.

01:21:41.782 --> 01:21:44.940
All three of these
groups, superb scientists,

01:21:44.940 --> 01:21:47.180
reported that, in
schizophrenia, you

01:21:47.180 --> 01:21:51.300
have a higher than expected
rate of abnormalities

01:21:51.300 --> 01:21:57.700
in genes of the major
histocompatibility complex.

01:21:57.700 --> 01:21:59.210
What is that about?

01:21:59.210 --> 01:22:01.050
The human equivalent,
wait, we're

01:22:01.050 --> 01:22:03.970
back at pheromones, and
individual signatures,

01:22:03.970 --> 01:22:05.350
and the immune system.

01:22:05.350 --> 01:22:06.840
What is this about?

01:22:06.840 --> 01:22:08.570
Nobody has a clue.

01:22:08.570 --> 01:22:11.970
But a remarkable consistency
in these three studies,

01:22:11.970 --> 01:22:15.910
they all found abnormalities in
these major histocompatibility

01:22:15.910 --> 01:22:20.690
genes that have to do with cell
signatures and immune defenses,

01:22:20.690 --> 01:22:21.470
all of that.

01:22:21.470 --> 01:22:24.330
And these were big effects
in all three studies.

01:22:24.330 --> 01:22:26.490
All the studies
were done superbly.

01:22:26.490 --> 01:22:29.370
People are just beginning
to digest that one.

01:22:29.370 --> 01:22:32.350
Nobody really has
a very clear idea.

01:22:32.350 --> 01:22:35.990
Some other genes have popped
up as having mutations

01:22:35.990 --> 01:22:39.420
or a lot of variants, where
one particular variant is more

01:22:39.420 --> 01:22:40.930
associated with schizophrenia.

01:22:40.930 --> 01:22:44.490
And there's this one gene
that's been found and replicated

01:22:44.490 --> 01:22:47.110
called DISC1.

01:22:47.110 --> 01:22:49.460
So does DISC1 do?

01:22:49.460 --> 01:22:50.640
Nobody has a clue.

01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:52.900
And just showing how pathetic
this whole finding is,

01:22:52.900 --> 01:22:55.710
what does DISC,
D-I-S-C, stand for?

01:22:55.710 --> 01:22:58.820
Disrupted in schizophrenia 1.

01:22:58.820 --> 01:23:02.320
That sure tells you a lot
about what's going on.

01:23:02.320 --> 01:23:04.220
Well, what happens
in schizophrenia?

01:23:04.220 --> 01:23:06.660
You have abnormalities
in genes that

01:23:06.660 --> 01:23:08.810
are abnormal in schizophrenia.

01:23:08.810 --> 01:23:10.000
Let's party.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.680
So you got DISC1, and people
trying to figure out it's

01:23:12.680 --> 01:23:14.580
got something to do
with second messengers.

01:23:14.580 --> 01:23:15.760
Nobody really knows.

01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:17.720
There's not a whole
lot that has been

01:23:17.720 --> 01:23:20.610
happening in this field
that counts as progress,

01:23:20.610 --> 01:23:22.680
really frustrating.

01:23:22.680 --> 01:23:26.070
People still need to make
sense of this finding.

01:23:26.070 --> 01:23:29.220
One area, though, that's
getting a lot of traction

01:23:29.220 --> 01:23:33.390
in the last few years goes back
to one of our weird mutations

01:23:33.390 --> 01:23:36.090
from our macroevolution
type lectures,

01:23:36.090 --> 01:23:39.860
that business of different
numbers of copies

01:23:39.860 --> 01:23:43.490
of a gene, macro
mutations on that level,

01:23:43.490 --> 01:23:47.870
transposable events, gene
duplications, a term we

01:23:47.870 --> 01:23:52.150
got back then is
copy number variants.

01:23:52.150 --> 01:23:54.950
How many copies of
particular genes?

01:23:54.950 --> 01:23:56.510
And the one thing
that seems to be

01:23:56.510 --> 01:24:00.310
consistent is all sorts
of genes in schizophrenia

01:24:00.310 --> 01:24:04.810
are popping up with abnormal
numbers of copies of the gene

01:24:04.810 --> 01:24:07.800
rather than abnormalities
in the gene itself.

01:24:07.800 --> 01:24:09.680
So that's really exciting.

01:24:09.680 --> 01:24:12.380
What's unexciting is
nobody's replicating

01:24:12.380 --> 01:24:13.970
which the duplications are.

01:24:13.970 --> 01:24:16.810
And most of the genes, nobody
has a clue what they do.

01:24:16.810 --> 01:24:19.360
People are flailing
other than seeing

01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:22.330
there's all sorts of different
genetic abnormalities

01:24:22.330 --> 01:24:23.410
that are popping up.

01:24:23.410 --> 01:24:24.620
How can that be?

01:24:24.620 --> 01:24:27.340
How could they all be
relevant to this disease?

01:24:27.340 --> 01:24:30.180
Back one hour,
it's not a disease.

01:24:30.180 --> 01:24:32.600
It's a whole bunch of
heterogeneous ones,

01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:34.010
and there's going
to be all sorts

01:24:34.010 --> 01:24:38.000
of different genetic
components to it.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.960
Now our next box,
early experience,

01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:44.190
and what early experience
immediately translates into

01:24:44.190 --> 01:24:46.710
is parenting style.

01:24:46.710 --> 01:24:50.310
What does schizophrenia have
to do with parenting style?

01:24:50.310 --> 01:24:52.890
We will see shortly,
which is my smooth way

01:24:52.890 --> 01:24:55.830
of trying to say that I just
jumped a paragraph by accident.

01:24:55.830 --> 01:24:57.840
So, of course, of
course, where we

01:24:57.840 --> 01:25:00.320
begin is looking at the
role of early stress

01:25:00.320 --> 01:25:01.820
in life, because
that's obviously

01:25:01.820 --> 01:25:04.700
where you have to begin
discussing early experience

01:25:04.700 --> 01:25:05.610
in schizophrenia.

01:25:05.610 --> 01:25:07.760
It's that whole
stress model thing.

01:25:07.760 --> 01:25:11.130
We already heard one version
of it, the adolescent stressor,

01:25:11.130 --> 01:25:15.010
takes the kid who's just
barely holding on and dips him

01:25:15.010 --> 01:25:15.880
way down.

01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:18.400
Another version of it
that should seem plenty

01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:22.280
logical to us by
now, prenatal stress.

01:25:22.280 --> 01:25:25.630
People who were fetuses
during the Dutch Hunger Winter

01:25:25.630 --> 01:25:28.660
have a higher than expected
rate of schizophrenia.

01:25:28.660 --> 01:25:31.480
People who were fetuses
during a huge famine

01:25:31.480 --> 01:25:37.770
in China, 1959 to 1961, higher
incidence of schizophrenia.

01:25:37.770 --> 01:25:42.430
Rats, expose them prenatally
to lots of glucocorticoids,

01:25:42.430 --> 01:25:45.090
and they wind up having
elevated dopamine levels

01:25:45.090 --> 01:25:47.420
in their frontal cortex.

01:25:47.420 --> 01:25:52.540
Have mechanical trauma at birth,
birth trauma, brief hypoxia,

01:25:52.540 --> 01:25:57.660
any of those things, increased
incidence of schizophrenia.

01:25:57.660 --> 01:25:59.220
This is very interesting.

01:25:59.220 --> 01:26:02.250
Back to our business,
remember, identical twins,

01:26:02.250 --> 01:26:04.560
they can either share
one single placenta

01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:08.780
or have two of them,
monochorionic or bichorionic.

01:26:08.780 --> 01:26:12.190
Monochorionic twins are
more likely to share

01:26:12.190 --> 01:26:17.090
the trait of schizophrenia than
bichorionic identical twins.

01:26:17.090 --> 01:26:21.040
Fetal environment,
stuff's going on there.

01:26:21.040 --> 01:26:22.890
What else with that?

01:26:22.890 --> 01:26:27.310
You wind up seeing a lot of
suggestions of interactions

01:26:27.310 --> 01:26:30.020
between the
neurochemistry of stress,

01:26:30.020 --> 01:26:31.760
and some of the
abnormalities here.

01:26:31.760 --> 01:26:33.230
You know how this works.

01:26:33.230 --> 01:26:36.750
Somewhere lurking out
there is a data set

01:26:36.750 --> 01:26:38.910
that's going to wind
up looking like this,

01:26:38.910 --> 01:26:41.720
bad version of the gene,
good version of the gene,

01:26:41.720 --> 01:26:44.850
more and more stressful of
the developmental environment.

01:26:44.850 --> 01:26:47.020
It hasn't been
identified yet, but it's

01:26:47.020 --> 01:26:50.320
got to be something like that
because everything's like that.

01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:54.680
So leading us now obviously
to discussing parenting style

01:26:54.680 --> 01:26:56.310
and schizophrenia.

01:26:56.310 --> 01:26:58.490
So where does that come in?

01:26:58.490 --> 01:27:03.170
Take the best psychiatrists
in the field, the titans,

01:27:03.170 --> 01:27:06.540
the grand poobahs
in 1950, and they

01:27:06.540 --> 01:27:08.340
would know the
exact answer, which

01:27:08.340 --> 01:27:12.020
is parenting style is the
cause of schizophrenia.

01:27:12.020 --> 01:27:16.240
Abnormal parenting is the
cause of schizophrenia.

01:27:16.240 --> 01:27:19.240
And out of this, of course,
since in those days,

01:27:19.240 --> 01:27:23.440
fathers did no parenting, what
you were saying is abnormal

01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:25.970
mothering is the cause
of schizophrenia.

01:27:25.970 --> 01:27:28.980
And the great term
that was used there

01:27:28.980 --> 01:27:32.360
was schizophrenogenic
mothering, mothering style

01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:35.390
that generates schizophrenia.

01:27:35.390 --> 01:27:38.120
What was schizophrenogenic
mothering about?

01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:41.930
Well, it depends on whose
paper you're reading.

01:27:41.930 --> 01:27:44.010
But, in general,
what they tended

01:27:44.010 --> 01:27:48.790
to have were elements of
conflicting emotional messages,

01:27:48.790 --> 01:27:51.380
conflicting, a double
bind is the phrase

01:27:51.380 --> 01:27:52.830
that always ran through it.

01:27:52.830 --> 01:27:55.540
The mother gets their son
two ties for his birthday,

01:27:55.540 --> 01:27:56.720
he puts one of them on.

01:27:56.720 --> 01:27:59.053
She says what's the matter,
you don't like the other tie

01:27:59.053 --> 01:28:01.670
I got you, or, at the
more fundamental level,

01:28:01.670 --> 01:28:04.380
saying you never say you love
me, you never say you love me,

01:28:04.380 --> 01:28:05.770
you never say-- I love you.

01:28:05.770 --> 01:28:07.750
How can that mean
anything to me when I just

01:28:07.750 --> 01:28:08.970
forced you to say that?

01:28:08.970 --> 01:28:10.500
There's no winning.

01:28:10.500 --> 01:28:12.630
And, in that view,
what schizophrenia

01:28:12.630 --> 01:28:17.380
was about was raising a kid
with distorted, contradictory,

01:28:17.380 --> 01:28:21.140
fragmented emotional demands
from the schizophrenogenic

01:28:21.140 --> 01:28:25.610
mother and out
comes schizophrenia.

01:28:25.610 --> 01:28:28.880
Now, actually, by the early
'50s, people in the field

01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:32.020
were feeling far more
broad in their thinking,

01:28:32.020 --> 01:28:34.360
recognizing this
might be damaging,

01:28:34.360 --> 01:28:37.300
in fact, to women who were
the mothers of schizophrenics.

01:28:37.300 --> 01:28:39.870
And a much more
humane model came in,

01:28:39.870 --> 01:28:42.380
which was recognizing the
possibility that fathers could

01:28:42.380 --> 01:28:44.390
screw kids up in the same way.

01:28:44.390 --> 01:28:47.030
What was more broadly
called this double bind

01:28:47.030 --> 01:28:50.450
theory of schizophrenia,
it is caused by parenting.

01:28:50.450 --> 01:28:53.930
It is caused by particular
parenting style.

01:28:53.930 --> 01:28:59.350
And then, in the early '50s,
along came the very first drug

01:28:59.350 --> 01:29:01.950
for schizophrenia,
the neuroleptics,

01:29:01.950 --> 01:29:04.160
the dopamine receptor blockers.

01:29:04.160 --> 01:29:06.510
And over the course
of the next few years,

01:29:06.510 --> 01:29:09.500
90% of the hospital
beds in this country

01:29:09.500 --> 01:29:12.350
for psychiatric patients
were emptied out,

01:29:12.350 --> 01:29:14.540
the first medication
that effectively

01:29:14.540 --> 01:29:16.060
treated schizophrenia.

01:29:16.060 --> 01:29:20.080
And at that point, if one
had any sort of capacity

01:29:20.080 --> 01:29:22.660
to face reality, all
of the proponents

01:29:22.660 --> 01:29:24.930
of schizophrenogenic
mothering should

01:29:24.930 --> 01:29:27.300
have been shocked and
stopped in their feet

01:29:27.300 --> 01:29:31.630
at that point, saying, my
God, what have we done.

01:29:31.630 --> 01:29:34.250
It's a biochemical disorder.

01:29:34.250 --> 01:29:38.030
It is not a disorder of mothers
who are not competent mothers.

01:29:38.030 --> 01:29:41.930
And it is fascinating to read
in the leading psychiatry

01:29:41.930 --> 01:29:45.260
journals from that time, you
would get these editorials

01:29:45.260 --> 01:29:48.460
from grand old men
in the field, where

01:29:48.460 --> 01:29:51.660
they would be saying I have
spent my whole life researching

01:29:51.660 --> 01:29:53.420
this disease, I
have spent my life

01:29:53.420 --> 01:29:56.930
trying to fight this disease,
which is hell, which tragically

01:29:56.930 --> 01:29:58.210
destroys lives.

01:29:58.210 --> 01:30:00.690
I've been trying to
do the right thing.

01:30:00.690 --> 01:30:02.850
I have been trying
to help people.

01:30:02.850 --> 01:30:05.240
Look, what I have done instead.

01:30:05.240 --> 01:30:07.880
This realization that
ran through the community

01:30:07.880 --> 01:30:11.190
that parenting style has
nothing to do with it.

01:30:11.190 --> 01:30:14.510
And it's half a century's
worth of mothers

01:30:14.510 --> 01:30:16.180
bringing in their
late adolescents

01:30:16.180 --> 01:30:19.380
for the first diagnosis and
being told, unfortunately,

01:30:19.380 --> 01:30:21.210
it's this nightmare
of a disease.

01:30:21.210 --> 01:30:22.640
How could this have happened?

01:30:22.640 --> 01:30:23.970
Where does it come from?

01:30:23.970 --> 01:30:25.350
You caused it.

01:30:25.350 --> 01:30:27.960
You caused it with
your mothering style.

01:30:27.960 --> 01:30:31.040
Endlessly, during the period
where modern biochemistry

01:30:31.040 --> 01:30:33.720
sweeps into psychiatry,
over and over,

01:30:33.720 --> 01:30:36.510
there are cases like this,
where the whole field has

01:30:36.510 --> 01:30:39.420
to stop and say,
my God, what have

01:30:39.420 --> 01:30:42.560
we done telling
people they caused it

01:30:42.560 --> 01:30:46.590
through some parenting style,
something of that sort.

01:30:46.590 --> 01:30:48.930
It's a biochemical disorder.

01:30:48.930 --> 01:30:52.050
So this was a shocking
finding at the time

01:30:52.050 --> 01:30:54.310
and transformed
the field in terms

01:30:54.310 --> 01:30:57.440
of schizophrenogenic
mothering going down

01:30:57.440 --> 01:30:59.350
the sink at that point.

01:30:59.350 --> 01:31:01.930
Nonetheless, there is an
interesting literature

01:31:01.930 --> 01:31:05.650
showing abnormalities
or oddities

01:31:05.650 --> 01:31:08.500
in the way communication
works in the families

01:31:08.500 --> 01:31:10.350
of schizophrenics.

01:31:10.350 --> 01:31:13.980
And this is a field now that's
called communication deviance.

01:31:13.980 --> 01:31:18.410
What you see is, on the average,
among first order relatives

01:31:18.410 --> 01:31:22.330
of schizophrenics, parents,
siblings, immediate family,

01:31:22.330 --> 01:31:27.200
what you see is, on the average,
an odd communicative style.

01:31:27.200 --> 01:31:30.610
You see a very
fragmented communicating,

01:31:30.610 --> 01:31:35.810
a very telescoped terse,
broken phrase sort of style.

01:31:35.810 --> 01:31:37.910
This has been noted very often.

01:31:37.910 --> 01:31:41.310
Again, this is not what is
seen in every close relative

01:31:41.310 --> 01:31:44.780
of a schizophrenic, but
higher than an expected rate.

01:31:44.780 --> 01:31:49.220
What you also see is all sorts
of realms of, in a sense,

01:31:49.220 --> 01:31:52.120
private communication
between schizophrenics

01:31:52.120 --> 01:31:53.560
and their close families.

01:31:53.560 --> 01:31:55.980
And the way this is
shown is with things

01:31:55.980 --> 01:31:58.300
like-- this was a
classic version.

01:31:58.300 --> 01:32:01.570
You take schizophrenics
and you show them

01:32:01.570 --> 01:32:04.620
a bunch of-- no,
that's not what you do.

01:32:04.620 --> 01:32:06.590
You give them a
Rorschach print, one

01:32:06.590 --> 01:32:08.950
of those ink symmetrical
things that's just

01:32:08.950 --> 01:32:10.650
completely chaotic looking.

01:32:10.650 --> 01:32:12.860
And they look at it
for a while, and then

01:32:12.860 --> 01:32:15.410
you put it into a stack
of a dozen other ones,

01:32:15.410 --> 01:32:16.700
and you mix them up.

01:32:16.700 --> 01:32:19.910
And you give them to the
parents of the individual.

01:32:19.910 --> 01:32:23.700
And the schizophrenic
or the healthy control

01:32:23.700 --> 01:32:26.880
is now trying to describe to
the parents which one they

01:32:26.880 --> 01:32:29.610
saw, how to find the
correct one in there.

01:32:29.610 --> 01:32:32.160
Control healthy
individuals sitting

01:32:32.160 --> 01:32:35.880
there trying to explain which
Rorschach block they saw,

01:32:35.880 --> 01:32:38.250
like no accuracy whatsoever.

01:32:38.250 --> 01:32:40.200
The schizophrenic
starts saying it

01:32:40.200 --> 01:32:43.210
looks like a butterfly
with a Van Dyke beard

01:32:43.210 --> 01:32:46.180
and ears on fire, and
the parents pull out

01:32:46.180 --> 01:32:47.640
the right one instantly.

01:32:47.640 --> 01:32:49.354
It works in the
opposite direction

01:32:49.354 --> 01:32:51.270
as well, where the parents
are the ones trying

01:32:51.270 --> 01:32:52.860
to describe the Rorschach test.

01:32:52.860 --> 01:32:55.040
It only works within families.

01:32:55.040 --> 01:32:58.850
The parents of the schizophrenic
are no better at chance

01:32:58.850 --> 01:33:00.610
when doing it with
someone else's

01:33:00.610 --> 01:33:02.140
child of a schizophrenic.

01:33:02.140 --> 01:33:05.020
There seems to be this going on.

01:33:05.020 --> 01:33:07.550
Logical interpretation,
this has nothing

01:33:07.550 --> 01:33:10.060
to do with the emergence
of schizophrenia.

01:33:10.060 --> 01:33:12.150
This is an obvious compensation.

01:33:12.150 --> 01:33:14.510
You have a child, you
have a sibling who

01:33:14.510 --> 01:33:16.630
is this thought
disordered, and there's

01:33:16.630 --> 01:33:19.120
going to be a whole lot more
adventurous communication

01:33:19.120 --> 01:33:22.770
in the family to try
to compensate for it.

01:33:22.770 --> 01:33:26.040
Few other things in terms of
early experience, and this

01:33:26.040 --> 01:33:28.930
is a whole other
domain of the disease,

01:33:28.930 --> 01:33:33.620
which is being exposed to all
sorts of infectious thingies.

01:33:33.620 --> 01:33:37.250
And this is a really interesting
provocative literature

01:33:37.250 --> 01:33:38.550
floating around.

01:33:38.550 --> 01:33:41.090
There's a far higher
than expected chance

01:33:41.090 --> 01:33:44.710
rate of schizophrenics
whose mothers were exposed

01:33:44.710 --> 01:33:47.540
to a number of different
viruses in third trimester

01:33:47.540 --> 01:33:48.866
of pregnancy.

01:33:48.866 --> 01:33:52.450
Ah, some sort
perinatal stressor,

01:33:52.450 --> 01:33:55.080
pathogenic challenge
to the system.

01:33:55.080 --> 01:33:58.360
And when you look at the
genomes of schizophrenics,

01:33:58.360 --> 01:34:03.160
they have much higher than
expected rate of viral DNA

01:34:03.160 --> 01:34:06.910
that has been inserted in there,
things called retroviruses.

01:34:06.910 --> 01:34:09.930
Technical matters don't matter.

01:34:09.930 --> 01:34:13.130
The main thing is more
evidence of higher exposure

01:34:13.130 --> 01:34:17.290
to viral pathogens,
an elevated history

01:34:17.290 --> 01:34:20.660
of neonatal viral infections.

01:34:20.660 --> 01:34:23.790
And then, the
cruelest one of all,

01:34:23.790 --> 01:34:26.920
which has to do with
a protozoan parasite,

01:34:26.920 --> 01:34:30.010
not a virus or bacteria,
but this protozoa

01:34:30.010 --> 01:34:32.720
called Toxoplasma gondii.

01:34:32.720 --> 01:34:37.660
And not Gandhi in the
Gandhian sense, but probably

01:34:37.660 --> 01:34:39.870
because it's even
pronounced differently.

01:34:39.870 --> 01:34:41.462
How are you pronouncing
it these days?

01:34:41.462 --> 01:34:42.670
Gondii.

01:34:42.670 --> 01:34:43.424
Gondii.

01:34:43.424 --> 01:34:45.710
Gondii, because there's
two Is at the end,

01:34:45.710 --> 01:34:47.880
which the old Mahatma
never quite came up with.

01:34:47.880 --> 01:34:51.970
But this parasite manages to get
more Is in there than he did.

01:34:51.970 --> 01:34:56.600
So it's Toxoplasma gondii,
as everybody knows.

01:34:56.600 --> 01:35:00.140
Toxoplasma is interesting.

01:35:00.140 --> 01:35:02.490
It has this
interesting life cycle.

01:35:02.490 --> 01:35:04.730
It reproduces in
the gut of cats.

01:35:04.730 --> 01:35:08.010
It comes out in cat feces,
feces are eaten by rodents.

01:35:08.010 --> 01:35:10.886
Now in rodents, and toxo's
evolutionary challenge

01:35:10.886 --> 01:35:12.260
has been to figure
out how to get

01:35:12.260 --> 01:35:14.280
rodents inside cats stomachs.

01:35:14.280 --> 01:35:17.340
And toxo does this
amazing thing, which

01:35:17.340 --> 01:35:20.770
my lab is doing some work
on, including Patrick,

01:35:20.770 --> 01:35:24.130
and looking at the
thing that toxo does

01:35:24.130 --> 01:35:29.570
is it makes rats begin to like
the smell of cats, and to go up

01:35:29.570 --> 01:35:30.550
and check it out.

01:35:30.550 --> 01:35:33.520
And soon, you are inside
the stomach of the cat

01:35:33.520 --> 01:35:36.190
and completing
toxo's life cycle.

01:35:36.190 --> 01:35:39.320
How it does it is
incredibly interesting

01:35:39.320 --> 01:35:40.390
and slowly emerging.

01:35:40.390 --> 01:35:42.760
So what's going on
with toxo in humans,

01:35:42.760 --> 01:35:44.880
people who are
infected with toxo

01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:49.300
have a higher than expected
rate of mild neuropsychological

01:35:49.300 --> 01:35:52.690
disinhibition, a
little bit of problems

01:35:52.690 --> 01:35:55.000
with frontal
regulation of behavior,

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:59.010
higher than expected rates
of serious car accidents,

01:35:59.010 --> 01:36:02.840
higher than expected rates for
the same degree of depression,

01:36:02.840 --> 01:36:06.130
of attempting suicide, a
picture of a certain degree

01:36:06.130 --> 01:36:07.510
of impulsivity.

01:36:07.510 --> 01:36:10.980
Not big effects, but,
nonetheless, it pops up there.

01:36:10.980 --> 01:36:13.730
But parallel with
that, from day one,

01:36:13.730 --> 01:36:17.500
there's also been a literature
showing that Toxoplasma

01:36:17.500 --> 01:36:21.700
exposure increases the
risk of schizophrenia.

01:36:21.700 --> 01:36:24.800
Individuals whose mothers
were exposed to toxo

01:36:24.800 --> 01:36:27.900
during pregnancy or
looking at schizophrenics

01:36:27.900 --> 01:36:30.360
and looking in their
blood and seeing higher

01:36:30.360 --> 01:36:34.970
than anticipated levels of
antibodies against Toxoplasma,

01:36:34.970 --> 01:36:39.210
evidence of this whole world
of a connection between cats

01:36:39.210 --> 01:36:42.510
and schizophrenia,
and all sorts of hints

01:36:42.510 --> 01:36:45.370
there, very, very
slowly emerging field.

01:36:45.370 --> 01:36:48.920
It is a real finding and it
is a well-replicated one.

01:36:48.920 --> 01:36:50.560
There's some connection there.

01:36:50.560 --> 01:36:54.330
So where does these genes having
to do with immune function

01:36:54.330 --> 01:36:55.140
come in?

01:36:55.140 --> 01:36:57.530
Maybe this is
pertinent to this world

01:36:57.530 --> 01:37:02.690
of viral correlates of
schizophrenia, parasitic ones.

01:37:02.690 --> 01:37:04.520
Nobody knows.

01:37:04.520 --> 01:37:06.830
Finally, what have we got?

01:37:06.830 --> 01:37:09.380
This challenge that we're going
to have with-- when you read

01:37:09.380 --> 01:37:11.110
the depression
chapter, all of that,

01:37:11.110 --> 01:37:13.270
is how do you put
these pieces together.

01:37:13.270 --> 01:37:16.300
How do you put together
adolescent stress

01:37:16.300 --> 01:37:20.780
with prenatal viruses
with enlarged ventricles,

01:37:20.780 --> 01:37:23.910
with funny genetic
abnormalities here?

01:37:23.910 --> 01:37:26.400
There isn't a very
good integrated model

01:37:26.400 --> 01:37:29.470
at this point to how to
put the pieces together.

01:37:29.470 --> 01:37:32.550
The field has not
gotten that far.

01:37:32.550 --> 01:37:36.300
So we're talking about genetic
abnormalities, blah, blah,

01:37:36.300 --> 01:37:36.820
all of that.

01:37:36.820 --> 01:37:38.570
And thus, you
know, our final box

01:37:38.570 --> 01:37:41.490
has to be the evolution
of schizophrenia.

01:37:41.490 --> 01:37:45.180
Where did schizophrenia
evolve from?

01:37:45.180 --> 01:37:48.990
First question you would ask
is, well, do you see something

01:37:48.990 --> 01:37:51.470
like schizophrenia
in other species.

01:37:51.470 --> 01:37:53.140
And you don't.

01:37:53.140 --> 01:37:56.800
You look at complex
primates and you

01:37:56.800 --> 01:37:59.100
see things that look
like depression,

01:37:59.100 --> 01:38:02.580
you see reactive depression,
you see melancholia,

01:38:02.580 --> 01:38:05.120
you see, in some cases,
depression so severe

01:38:05.120 --> 01:38:06.530
as to prove fatal.

01:38:06.530 --> 01:38:09.720
You don't see animals
having to loose associations

01:38:09.720 --> 01:38:12.910
with proverbs, and concrete
thought, and delusions,

01:38:12.910 --> 01:38:14.200
and hallucinations.

01:38:14.200 --> 01:38:16.280
Animals that start
acting schizophrenic

01:38:16.280 --> 01:38:17.940
get eaten that evening.

01:38:17.940 --> 01:38:19.830
So there's not a
whole lot of insight

01:38:19.830 --> 01:38:21.510
from the zoological world.

01:38:21.510 --> 01:38:25.860
There's not any animal
precedents for schizophrenia.

01:38:25.860 --> 01:38:27.180
So how about in humans?

01:38:27.180 --> 01:38:29.000
How did schizophrenia evolve?

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.600
We are now back to one
of our first lectures.

01:38:31.600 --> 01:38:33.430
Why did giraffes
have long necks?

01:38:33.430 --> 01:38:35.770
Because it's a good
thing that allows

01:38:35.770 --> 01:38:37.800
them to pass on more
copies of their genes,

01:38:37.800 --> 01:38:40.010
because it's an adaptive trait.

01:38:40.010 --> 01:38:43.780
By the rules of Darwin,
schizophrenia is maladaptive.

01:38:43.780 --> 01:38:46.420
Schizophrenics have a
lower reproductive rate

01:38:46.420 --> 01:38:48.160
than their unaffected siblings.

01:38:48.160 --> 01:38:50.760
By the math, that
is thus a trait

01:38:50.760 --> 01:38:53.360
that should be being
selected against.

01:38:53.360 --> 01:38:57.905
Yet, schizophrenia persists at
this 1% to 2% in every culture

01:38:57.905 --> 01:38:58.870
out there.

01:38:58.870 --> 01:39:00.900
Historical records
indicate things

01:39:00.900 --> 01:39:03.300
that convincingly sound
like schizophrenia

01:39:03.300 --> 01:39:04.640
have been there forever.

01:39:04.640 --> 01:39:08.160
And, thus, one has to bring up
the question that always lurks

01:39:08.160 --> 01:39:11.980
in a scenario like this, which
is are there circumstances

01:39:11.980 --> 01:39:15.330
where schizophrenia is
in fact adaptive, where

01:39:15.330 --> 01:39:18.000
it is advantageous,
where it increases

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.260
one's reproductive success.

01:39:20.260 --> 01:39:23.200
The only domain where
that has had any evidence

01:39:23.200 --> 01:39:25.710
at all in the literature
is schizophrenics

01:39:25.710 --> 01:39:29.580
appear to have a lower incidence
of certain types of cancers,

01:39:29.580 --> 01:39:35.390
in particular, lung and
throat, esophageal cancers.

01:39:35.390 --> 01:39:38.400
And that's after controlling
for smoking rates, all of that.

01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:40.870
Not a big effect, but
that causes people

01:39:40.870 --> 01:39:43.250
to mumble something
about maybe schizophrenia

01:39:43.250 --> 01:39:47.260
was selected for its anti-cancer
properties in the disease,

01:39:47.260 --> 01:39:49.730
and balanced
selection, all of that.

01:39:49.730 --> 01:39:53.300
However, there is another
possible adaptive thing

01:39:53.300 --> 01:39:55.750
that's lurking around
in there, something

01:39:55.750 --> 01:39:58.180
which causes some
of these traits

01:39:58.180 --> 01:40:01.080
to not only no longer
be maladaptive,

01:40:01.080 --> 01:40:04.560
but to be wildly useful
in certain contexts

01:40:04.560 --> 01:40:05.930
of human society.

01:40:05.930 --> 01:40:09.850
And what you'll see is it's
not full-blown schizophrenia,

01:40:09.850 --> 01:40:12.020
it's the milder
versions that you

01:40:12.020 --> 01:40:13.630
see in some of the relatives.

01:40:13.630 --> 01:40:16.790
And thus, just to give you
a sense of where things

01:40:16.790 --> 01:40:20.672
are heading, we'll talk about
that on Friday in the lecture

01:40:20.672 --> 01:40:21.616
on--

01:40:21.616 --> 01:40:25.300
