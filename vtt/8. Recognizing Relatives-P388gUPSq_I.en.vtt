00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:08.280
Stanford University.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.590
--push off into new terrain,
here-- yet another bucket.

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.430
But before doing that,
various bits of feedback

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:16.510
from office hours.

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:17.850
Hearing from TAs.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.790
Getting a sense of where
the grand, gaping craters

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:23.620
of confusion are so far.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:25.280
And apparently an
awful lot of them

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.670
were provided in the
last two days of lectures

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:28.860
with behavior genetics.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.640
Various issues that came up.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.830
Clearly, one of the most
complicated, inaccessible,

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:35.450
subtle, pain in
the neck concepts

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.420
in the whole class, which is
this heritability business.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.339
So memorize the
following two sentences,

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:43.880
because it all comes down to
the difference between something

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:48.750
that is inherited and
how heritable a trait is.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.510
The fact that humans
overwhelmingly

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.840
have five fingers reflects the
fact that the number of fingers

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.010
is an inherited trait.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.920
The fact that, when there are
some circumstances of humans

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.880
having other than
five fingers, it

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.510
is overwhelmingly
due to environmental

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.040
something-or-others is
an indication of the fact

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.770
that, nonetheless, variability
around the number of fingers--

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.880
heritability is essentially 0%.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.610
So get those two
sorted out, and you

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.390
have those two concepts
all under your belt

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.170
and very useful.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:22.010
Why is it useful?

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:23.890
First off, why is
this one useful?

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.970
Because it is important
to know the distinction.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.360
Everybody, for one
thing, out there

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.870
tends to view these as
telling the same thing.

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.910
And insofar as they think
it says the same thing,

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.370
they think that both terms
are referring to this.

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:41.620
Something that is genetically
regulated, genetically

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.020
determined-- whatever.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.330
Two totally different terms.

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.500
So one reason to
obsess over this

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.160
is that when the
newspapers give us

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.900
our sound bite of
"scientists report that,"

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.020
it's usually this one
that they're reporting,

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.790
with one of those marvelously
misleading numbers.

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.180
Which then sets people up
for thinking they have just

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.340
been told how much
do genes "determine"

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.300
some average feature
of this trait.

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:05.850
So, important to
tell them apart.

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.180
The other reason of
getting this sorted out

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.610
is not to only unlearn
the nonsense aspects

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.350
and misinterpreting this term
but because understanding

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.570
that term gives you
a lot of insights

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.600
into when and how
you are getting

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.360
gene-environment interactions.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.400
Caveat with that.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.450
Saying "when and how
you're getting"--

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.710
you're always getting
gene-environment interactions.

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.380
Remember the quote
from the other day.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.250
It's like saying,
which contributes

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.019
more to the volume of a square,
or the height, or the length,

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:33.310
or the roundiness, or whatever?

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.870
Yes, it's always
gene-environment interactions.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.880
Saying, in what
ways are there some

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.140
of the more interesting ones,
dramatic ones, in what realms--

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.670
Understand this, and you
avoid this confusion.

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.120
Understand this,
and it gives you

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.360
insights into
gene-environment interactions.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.860
OK.

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.330
Other issues that are coming up.

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.190
By now, we've looked at three
different broad approaches

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.660
to the biology of
social behavior.

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.105
The evolutionary stuff--
broadly stated-- the molecular,

00:02:59.105 --> 00:03:00.580
the behavior genetics.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.500
And what should
be clear by now is

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.560
if you were living inside
one of those buckets,

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.610
you hate each of the other
two and trash them entirely.

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.820
So we get to the first of our
great, conflicting points,

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.940
which is, does that mean
one of these is wrong?

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.600
No, one of them is not wrong.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:15.600
None of them are wrong.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.130
Some are more right
than others, and some

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:19.560
are a lot better than others.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.730
But nonetheless,
these are all-- again,

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.060
from the very first
lecture-- different levels

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.250
of description.

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.230
Another way to begin to
think about this, in terms

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.420
of what we've now
been focusing on--

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.410
and this sort of coming up
from some questions afterward.

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.230
So by now we've had
the term "epigenetics."

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.450
That's come in in the
last couple of lectures.

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.110
And there are at least
three different levels,

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.280
three different buckets, with
which you can define the term.

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.850
What is epigenetics?

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.840
Epigenetics is the way
the culture, environment--

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.000
all of that-- affects biology.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.090
That's a certain broad
way of stating that.

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.950
NodA stated that
way, you are making

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.090
biology synonymous with
genetics, which ain't so.

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.340
But nonetheless, that's
a certain broad level

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:02.270
of stating it.

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:04.720
In another discipline,
a very sort

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.990
of first pass at
molecular stuff,

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:08.640
what is epigenetics about?

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.710
It's the way in which
environments turns genes

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:13.690
on and off.

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.640
And at another level of
explanation, more reductive,

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.430
what is epigenetics about?

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.860
It is regulation of chromatin
remodeling and methylation

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.360
of genes and all of that.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.040
Do not panic, if
that's not the level

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.200
you want to know it about.

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.825
That's the business
from the other day,

00:04:28.825 --> 00:04:32.640
about changing access
of transcription factors

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.510
to DNA-- jargony
way of doing it.

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:35.010
Don't worry.

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.170
The main point being that this
is a completely different level

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:40.240
of defining this.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.650
This is the whole point in here.

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.310
We are beginning to see
different disciplinary

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:45.030
approaches.

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.930
We are beginning to see where
one discipline has decided

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:49.620
they have answered a question.

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.190
This is how culture
affects biology?

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:53.310
Give me a break.

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.850
Show me which genes
we're talking about!

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:57.240
We're talking about genes, here.

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.220
Give me a break.

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.800
Show me-- is this chromatin
remodeling-- what's

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:01.740
the mechanism for it?

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.190
How reversible is it?

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:06.030
One discipline's answer is the
next one's starting point--

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:06.690
blah, blah.

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:10.250
One discipline's wonderfully
satisfying scientific answer

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:11.830
is the basis for
the next discipline

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:13.630
to be totally
contemptuous of them.

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:15.200
You call that science?

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.830
This is sort of the
whole point, here,

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:20.650
beginning to see how we could
chip out a way between these.

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:23.070
More bits of clarification.

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.940
Amid that, one of the things
that really came through

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:28.030
is-- in the sort of
ratio of praising

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:31.520
to trashing-- I was clearly
spending a lot of the last two

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.230
days trashing the
behavior-genetics approaches.

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:36.430
So a little bit of
clarification, there.

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:38.510
First off, we can
broadly divide what

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:42.190
came the last two days into
classical behavior genetics.

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:45.800
And that's the comparing
monozygotic and dizygotic

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:46.730
twins.

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:48.870
That's the adoption
studies, that's

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:52.400
the twins adopted at birth--
that's all of those approaches,

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:53.020
there.

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:56.430
Those are all the ones where
you were just inferring really

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:58.860
indirectly that there's
something genetically going

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:59.670
on there.

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:02.470
The other half, and much more
sort of the modern behavior

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:05.900
genetics, is marrying these
traditional approaches

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.810
with molecular biology.

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:11.390
And that was the business at
the end-- you know the gene,

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:14.030
and you kind of have an
idea of what it might do.

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:16.590
How does that map onto
behavioral variability

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:17.590
in humans?

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:19.320
You know the
behavior, and you've

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.650
got some sense of
its variability.

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:24.410
How does that map onto
variability in genes?

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:27.470
This is the much more powerful,
contemporary end of it.

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:29.330
So what is this end good for?

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.380
All it's good for is pronouncing
that something's genetic,

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:35.330
or it's 73% genetic
and then you trash it

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:36.570
because that's jibberish.

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:38.200
What it's good for mainly is--

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.080
OK, so you've got
an adoption study--

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.920
classical
behavior-genetic study--

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:46.370
where they're adopted right
at birth, within seconds,

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:48.050
and raised in
different households.

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:50.020
Oh, you haven't ruled
out environment!

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:51.690
Don't forget
prenatal environment.

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:53.310
Oh, you haven't ruled
out environment!

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:55.280
Remember the
nonrandom assignment

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:56.580
of adoption-- all of that.

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:58.410
Does this mean this
approach is useless?

00:06:58.410 --> 00:06:58.910
No.

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:01.880
What it's good for is
demonstrating nonetheless well

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.770
we've just ruled out all
sorts of realms of environment

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:08.250
that people would
guess is consequential.

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:10.340
It's less consequential
than you think.

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:13.350
We haven't ruled out
environment entirely.

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:16.080
And just because it's all
gene-environment interaction,

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:18.910
we certainly can't come up
with a stupid number like that.

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:21.370
But what this is good
for is at least showing,

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:23.920
here's domains where
people-- a lot of people--

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:27.920
would have assumed there is
big environmental effects.

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.470
Much less than you would think.

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:31.360
So that's the much
more conservative, sort

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.850
of sobrietous thing that
people can do with that field.

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:36.120
The fact that far too
few of them actually

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:39.500
do that is reasons to trash--
no, well, nonetheless, there's

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:41.330
lots of good things
in behavior genetics.

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:44.010
But that's the limited
domain where it's useful.

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:46.310
OK, so just beginning
to get a sense, here,

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:49.060
of the various things
that are confusing.

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:52.090
Obviously, no one on
earth in any exam in here

00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:55.230
is going to be asked to
choose which field is better

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:58.390
and which field gives
more-- you know, kum by ya

00:07:58.390 --> 00:07:59.070
and all of that.

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:01.820
But just recognizing
the different approaches

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:04.660
and the wonderful
rainbow diversity of ways

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:09.070
to think about mating in
fruit flies or whatever.

00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:11.100
And just beginning
to see by now,

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:12.870
this is what the
whole class is about.

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:15.800
Speaking of that, I recall
from the first class on that.

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.340
There's somebody in here who
I think was an English Lit

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:19.400
grad student.

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:22.400
If you have a chance, email me
about how it's going in here.

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:22.900
Let's see.

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:23.720
What else?

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:24.220
Next week.

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:24.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:26.830
No, I'm curious.

00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:28.800
I am very pleased
whoever you are--

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:32.450
assuming you haven't fled after
the first class-- is in here.

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:32.950
Let's see.

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:33.480
Other stuff.

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:33.980
OK.

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:34.919
Schedule.

00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:36.900
Next Monday, this
coming Monday, we

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:39.530
will have a lecture on yet
another of our disciplines,

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:40.840
ethology.

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:43.340
And we will see that's
a totally different way

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:44.470
of doing it-- blah, blah.

00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:46.200
Wednesday, Friday,
and the following

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:50.420
Monday are the catch-up lectures
in class, taught by the TAs.

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:51.930
Two of the lectures,
introduction

00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:53.300
to the nervous system.

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:55.650
The third one, introduction
to endocrinology.

00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:57.410
It will be a broad overview.

00:08:57.410 --> 00:08:59.520
It is explicitly designed
for people who have

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:01.460
no prior background in this.

00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:04.090
But what I think is
probably a good idea is,

00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:06.380
even if you believe you
have prior background in it,

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:10.320
maybe assume it might be a good
thing to get a refresher on it.

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:12.420
And this will be very useful.

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:14.490
Following that, we will
have two more lectures--

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:16.680
more advanced topics
and basic features

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:20.140
of neuroendocrinology-- and then
staggering into the midterm.

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:23.220
And then-- oh, then--
the second half comes.

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:25.040
Just a sense of what's coming.

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:25.750
OK.

00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:27.500
So that's where we're at.

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:29.920
So now we transition
to the next subject,

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:32.500
here, which is-- no,
actually, before I forget--

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:35.082
how many-- did people see this--
the article in the New York

00:09:35.082 --> 00:09:37.540
Times this morning about the
study-- the Chutes and Ladders

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:38.040
study?

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:42.920
Did anybody see it?

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:47.080
It was posted this--
nobody saw it?

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:50.839
This was-- you know the
game Chutes and Ladders?

00:09:50.839 --> 00:09:52.380
OK, we all played
Chutes and Ladders.

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:55.590
This was this massive study
funded by the World Health

00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:58.250
Organization where
what they did--

00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:00.160
this is going to be
the definitive study

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:01.080
on the subject.

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:03.399
They showed that
people from Nepal

00:10:03.399 --> 00:10:05.440
are better at playing
Chutes and Ladders than are

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:06.680
people from Belgium.

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:07.970
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:09.420
Cool study!

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:11.810
I don't know how
you guys missed it.

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:12.340
OK.

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:13.710
You need to know about this.

00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:14.670
This is important.

00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:16.450
What do you want to
know about this study?

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:19.700
This massive study shows
that people from Nepal

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:23.040
are better at Chutes and Ladders
than people from Belgium.

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:25.780
Ask me questions, since
you were terribly, woefully

00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:27.280
underinformed about this.

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:28.940
What more information
do you need

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:30.737
to be impressed and
tell everybody about it

00:10:30.737 --> 00:10:31.570
in the dorm tonight?

00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:33.360
What else you want to
know about this study?

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:34.193
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:10:34.693 --> 00:10:35.790
"What does 'better' mean?"

00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:37.760
OK, social relativist.

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:40.826
And does it mean that you
learn more about yourself

00:10:40.826 --> 00:10:41.950
playing Chutes and Ladders?

00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:42.450
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:45.350
Does it mean that you make
the world a happy-- you win!

00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:46.530
You win, win, win!

00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:48.237
OK, so winning is the end point.

00:10:48.237 --> 00:10:48.820
Good question.

00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:50.838
What else do you want
to know about the study?

00:10:50.838 --> 00:10:51.338
Yeah.

00:10:51.338 --> 00:10:52.802
Why?

00:10:52.802 --> 00:10:53.620
Why?

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:54.150
Why?

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:56.200
You ask that?

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.160
Read Aristotle!

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:01.060
Since humans first
pulled out of the mud,

00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:03.980
this has been the thing
we have wanted to know.

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:04.960
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:06.324
And now we do.

00:11:06.324 --> 00:11:07.560
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:10.390
Son, the difference between
knowledge and wisdom--

00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:11.960
OK, so, why?

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:13.380
OK, what else do
you want to know?

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:14.536
What are your questions?

00:11:14.536 --> 00:11:15.036
Yeah.

00:11:15.036 --> 00:11:16.540
What the methods
of the study were.

00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:17.420
The methods.

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:18.350
Very good.

00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:19.610
OK, various methods.

00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:21.780
Do you want to break it
down into more details?

00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:23.680
Given some of the
critical tools you

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.720
have by now, in
terms of methods,

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:28.470
before deciding how impressed
you are or not with this study.

00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:31.750
What sort of questions, now,
in the methodological realm.

00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:33.150
Yeah.

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:34.890
What population
they're sampling?

00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:36.650
Ah, very good question.

00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:39.480
Because we see a first
methodological issue.

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:41.550
Are you getting a
decent sample size,

00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:44.490
so that you're confident that
you can actually say something

00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:46.440
about the population at large.

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:47.790
And that's a great question.

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:51.136
It was done on everybody in
Nepal and everybody in Belgium.

00:11:51.136 --> 00:11:51.950
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:52.980
Good study!

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:54.415
OK, what else do
you want to know?

00:11:54.415 --> 00:11:55.290
What other questions?

00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:55.790
Yeah.

00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:59.290
In terms of their method, did
they pit people from Nepal

00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:03.512
against people from
Belgium in one game, or--

00:12:03.512 --> 00:12:04.970
Well, that's an
excellent question.

00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:08.530
Every single person in the study
from both Belgium and Nepal

00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:10.610
played one game against
every single other person

00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:11.230
in the study.

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:12.362
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:12.362 --> 00:12:13.820
That's why you
haven't been hearing

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:15.926
much about either country
in the news lately.

00:12:15.926 --> 00:12:17.550
They've been very
busy with this study.

00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:20.930
OK, so, good methodology,
large sample size,

00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:22.220
random assignments of games.

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:23.344
What else you want to know?

00:12:23.344 --> 00:12:24.276
Yeah.

00:12:24.276 --> 00:12:27.692
Why-- the question and subject
to ask worth reading about,

00:12:27.692 --> 00:12:29.650
and why did they [INAUDIBLE]?

00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:32.480
Why'd they-- OK, that one again.

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:34.320
It's self-evident.

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:38.980
Know thyself, or know the
Nepalese and the Belgians

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:40.200
or something.

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:43.050
This is a-- I'm glad
I know this now.

00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:44.650
I'm glad they went and did that.

00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:46.310
OK, what else do
you want to know?

00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:47.900
Obviously, a matter
of subjective

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:50.784
taste as to what counts as an
important scientific subject.

00:12:50.784 --> 00:12:51.950
this strikes me as critical.

00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:53.820
What else do you want
to know, in terms

00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:55.850
of what sort of conclusions?

00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:57.600
They kind of hint--
they're not positive--

00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:00.510
but they're kind of hinting
at a genetic component to it.

00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:02.570
Yeah-- question in
the back, there.

00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:04.109
Yeah.

00:13:04.109 --> 00:13:06.830
What skills are involved
in Chutes and Ladders?

00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:08.670
What skills are involved?

00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:11.720
It involves, um-- what is it?

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:13.627
They have a whole list, there.

00:13:13.627 --> 00:13:17.030
Um-- let's see.

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:19.510
Various tasks involving
spatial memory.

00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:24.441
Various tasks involving reversal
performance and telekinesis.

00:13:24.441 --> 00:13:24.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:27.040
So it taps into all
of those domains.

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:29.160
What else do you want
to know about the study?

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:29.660
Yeah

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:30.660
Is it inheritable?

00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:32.040
Is it heritable?

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:34.810
Great-- oh, ho, ho,
is it heritable!

00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:36.420
So which are you asking about?

00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:39.300
OK, well, they did it.

00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:42.040
They are suggesting there's
some degree of heritability.

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:43.240
And they did it right.

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:46.420
They went after all the issues
we've learned about by now.

00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:49.530
Specifically, what I'm saying
is that every single person

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:53.160
in Nepal and in Belgium was
cross-fostered to somebody

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:53.840
in Ecuador.

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:55.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:58.320
In fact, they did it fetally,
right after conception.

00:13:58.320 --> 00:13:58.960
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:00.680
So they can-- the
prenatal stuff.

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:02.960
What else do you want to
know, in order to decide,

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:06.314
am I impressed about the
fact that people from Nepal

00:14:06.314 --> 00:14:08.730
are better at Chutes and Ladders
than people from Belgium?

00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:09.230
Yeah.

00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:11.047
Were they all good at
the exact same amount

00:14:11.047 --> 00:14:13.260
of Chutes and
Ladders as children?

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:14.220
Oh!

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:14.880
Yes.

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:17.090
In fact, none of them had
been exposed to it before.

00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:19.059
They were all raised
in hydroponic gardens,

00:14:19.059 --> 00:14:20.225
without Chutes and Ladders--

00:14:20.225 --> 00:14:20.725
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:20.725 --> 00:14:23.400
--and they were only released
in time for doing this.

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:24.460
OK what else?

00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:25.226
Yes.

00:14:25.226 --> 00:14:28.850
What's the amount of variance
within each individual group?

00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:30.320
Oh, good question!

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:32.540
Here we are, getting
to that-- all of that.

00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:34.890
Everybody got the exact
same score from Nepal,

00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:37.410
and everybody from Belgium
got the exact same score.

00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:38.890
So that's kind of impressive.

00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:40.180
Are you impressed yet?

00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:43.000
Are you impressed enough
yet to go run out of here,

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.580
screaming with this news?

00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:46.436
What else do you need to know?

00:14:46.436 --> 00:14:46.936
Yeah.

00:14:46.936 --> 00:14:47.890
Who went first?

00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:48.720
Who went first?

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:50.650
They randomized it.

00:14:50.650 --> 00:14:56.320
They randomized it by-- the
entire populations played, um--

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:58.640
oh, what is that--

00:14:58.640 --> 00:14:59.140
Roshambo.

00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:00.790
Roshambo, yes.

00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:02.100
They played roshambo.

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:04.980
And, best of all, they had to
play roshambo in Esperanto.

00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:06.557
Yes-- more.

00:15:06.557 --> 00:15:09.360
What was the environment in
which they test [INAUDIBLE]?

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:12.110
OK, they were released
from the hydroponic garden,

00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:15.680
and then all of them were placed
in a completely sterile bubble

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:17.900
environment, where
all they had in there

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:20.790
were copies of People magazine
in a language they didn't

00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:21.430
understand.

00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:22.190
So it was well--

00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:22.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:24.300
Environment was very
well controlled-for.

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:25.558
What else do you need to know?

00:15:25.558 --> 00:15:27.022
How much better were they?

00:15:27.022 --> 00:15:28.690
Like, 0.001--

00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:30.965
Ah!

00:15:30.965 --> 00:15:31.875
Ah!

00:15:31.875 --> 00:15:33.420
There we have it.

00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:35.890
They had a huge sample size.

00:15:35.890 --> 00:15:38.450
They cross-fostered as fetuses.

00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:40.540
They controlled for environment.

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:42.130
They got everybody in there.

00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:43.700
They did the right techniques.

00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:46.170
They randomized at
every possible choice.

00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:47.340
That is so impressive.

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:48.480
That is so impress--

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:50.410
How big is the difference?

00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:52.440
Is it a big difference?

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:56.010
And this is a critical
thing to start putting there

00:15:56.010 --> 00:15:59.380
in your armamentarium
of critical questions,

00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:01.190
to start having skeptical ones.

00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:01.690
Great.

00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:03.720
You've got a whole
bunch of tools by now.

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:04.500
Whoa!

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:05.450
They said "genetic."

00:16:05.450 --> 00:16:06.570
Did you control for this?

00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:07.840
Did you control for that?

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:09.960
Whoa, they see a
difference, there.

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:10.870
Well, wait a second.

00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:12.940
Did they all have the
same exper-- whoa,

00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:14.480
did they have a big sample size?

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:15.640
All of it covered.

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:17.540
Great, wonderful,
perfect science.

00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:19.910
They get every single
bit of it covered, there.

00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:22.510
But then the critical
thing you better ask

00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:24.660
is, how big is the difference?

00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:26.750
Is it impressive or not?

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:29.770
Because we all think we've got
the basic tools-- or hopefully

00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:32.740
we all have the basic tools--
for going at these issues.

00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:35.720
OK, was a study
done in a way that

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:38.050
was clear-cut and unobjective?

00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:39.830
Were people blinded
to whether or not

00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:42.230
this person was
Nepalese or Belgian

00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:44.280
or-- was there
appropriate blinding?

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:48.320
Was it done in a way that you
can falsify your finding--

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:51.760
in a sense, the definition
of experimental science?

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:54.280
Was it designed in--
was it independently

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:55.950
replicated by anybody else?

00:16:55.950 --> 00:16:59.010
We all have those tools
under our belt by now.

00:16:59.010 --> 00:17:01.374
But far too often, we are
not trained, at that point,

00:17:01.374 --> 00:17:02.290
to say, wait a second.

00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:05.920
Before I get all excited, how
big of a difference was it?

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:08.810
Let me give you a
real example of this.

00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:10.760
And this was a paper,
about three years ago,

00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:13.854
in the journal Science-- which
you should get a sense by now

00:17:13.854 --> 00:17:15.520
that the journals
Science and Nature are

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:18.400
the two official biggie
ones on this planet,

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:20.310
in terms of credibility.

00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:24.250
And this was a paper
having to do with IQ.

00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:28.550
And this was a paper having
to do with IQ and birth order.

00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:30.250
And what they showed
in this paper,

00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:34.460
with spectacular statistical
confidence and as much

00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:36.400
of, like, all the
controls in place

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:39.500
as you can ask for from the
hydroponically gardened fetuses

00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:41.890
in Nepal-- they did
absolutely perfectly.

00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:44.660
What they showed in
the definitive study,

00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:48.720
with 250,000
18-year-olds in Norway,

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:51.770
was that there is a
reliable IQ difference

00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:55.440
depending on whether you were
firstborn or latter-born.

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:58.650
OK, how many of
you are firstborn?

00:17:58.650 --> 00:17:59.400
Whoa!

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:02.050
How many of you are only childs?

00:18:02.050 --> 00:18:05.170
OK, how many of
you are number 2?

00:18:05.170 --> 00:18:07.780
How many of you are
more than number 2?

00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:10.130
OK, so, how many of
you think the highest

00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:12.110
IQ comes from the firstborn?

00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:14.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:17.780
OK, and we'll assume the
converse with the other group.

00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:21.180
Did anybody just vote against
their own birth order?

00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:22.080
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:23.220
Whoa-- OK.

00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:26.310
Well, that's-- impressive.

00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:28.430
We salute you.

00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:30.120
OK, so they found a difference.

00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:32.000
They found a
difference, which is,

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.770
firstborns-- in this very
statistically reliable way--

00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:38.470
have higher IQ
than latter-borns.

00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:40.800
They restricted the analysis
just to second-borns

00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:42.100
to keep things clearer.

00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:45.870
And they showed firstborns have
higher IQ than second-borns.

00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:49.160
250,000 people--
as close as you can

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:51.760
get to all the people
from Nepal and Belgian.

00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:53.270
Huge sample size.

00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:54.120
So they report this.

00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:57.040
This was the most
thorough study ever done.

00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:59.490
So what sort of questions
do you want to ask?

00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:02.610
Give me hypotheses
for what's going on.

00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:04.850
Obviously, sort of
one is that, like,

00:19:04.850 --> 00:19:07.060
the parents pour protein
into the ears of firstborn

00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:10.000
and the second one just
gets Fritos or something.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.760
But give me other hypotheses
for what could be happening.

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:15.990
Possible explanation
for this, in terms

00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:21.042
of biological, sociocultural,
endo, immuno, psycho-- yeah.

00:19:21.042 --> 00:19:23.994
I think we already know that
firstborns tend to be more,

00:19:23.994 --> 00:19:27.540
like-- well, I mean-- it's
like the parents-- they're more

00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:30.244
worried about making mistakes,
and they kind of raise them

00:19:30.244 --> 00:19:32.244
harder, so to speak, and
then they sort of relax

00:19:32.244 --> 00:19:33.785
on the second-born
child. [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:33.785 --> 00:19:36.486
firstborns tend to go to college
more and stuff like that--

00:19:36.486 --> 00:19:38.320
do more traditional [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:40.290
OK, so, great hypothesis.

00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:43.189
It's more parental
investment in the firstborn,

00:19:43.189 --> 00:19:45.230
and those are the ones
with the parents freak out

00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:45.655
with everything.

00:19:45.655 --> 00:19:47.180
And by the time
there's a third one,

00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:48.624
they're all foraging
on their own

00:19:48.624 --> 00:19:49.790
when they're six months old.

00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:50.290
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:50.290 --> 00:19:52.450
OK, so, parental investment.

00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:54.730
They went after
that one correctly.

00:19:54.730 --> 00:19:57.380
Here's what they showed,
to rule that out.

00:19:57.380 --> 00:20:00.830
Which was, if you
are an only child,

00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:03.390
you have a lower
IQ-- on the average,

00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:07.680
blah blah-- then firstborns
who have younger siblings.

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:09.190
So it's not parental investment.

00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:12.130
It's something about being
the firstborn of multiples.

00:20:12.130 --> 00:20:14.034
Yeah.

00:20:14.034 --> 00:20:15.936
[INAUDIBLE] firstborns
are expected

00:20:15.936 --> 00:20:19.720
to kind of like [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:24.140
OK, so pressure on the
firstborns to be first born.

00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:26.420
How would that raise IQ?

00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:30.476
Um-- all right, just
kind of like-- kind

00:20:30.476 --> 00:20:32.076
of like responsibility
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:20:38.890 --> 00:20:41.200
OK, so that's one of
the models out there.

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:44.210
A variant on that
is, firstborns get

00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:47.130
pushed into a tutoring
position, early on.

00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:49.020
And the well-known fact
that occasionally now

00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:50.436
within teaching
something actually

00:20:50.436 --> 00:20:52.420
causes you to know what
you're talking about.

00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:55.490
So the firstborns, because
of this tutoring role-- oh,

00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:57.430
that would control
for the single child

00:20:57.430 --> 00:21:00.090
versus the firstborn
difference, there.

00:21:00.090 --> 00:21:02.160
So maybe it's a
tutoring phenomenon.

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:04.030
What else could be happening?

00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:05.520
What other possible notions?

00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:06.440
Yeah.

00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:10.152
It depends what age you're
looking at the kids at.

00:21:10.152 --> 00:21:12.532
Because if you're looking
at, like, actual children

00:21:12.532 --> 00:21:14.436
and comparing IQs,
older children

00:21:14.436 --> 00:21:18.203
will probably have higher IQs
because they've had longer time

00:21:18.203 --> 00:21:19.750
in life to learn.

00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:20.530
OK.

00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:22.010
Great idea.

00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:25.580
Up to age 12,
latter-borns tend to have

00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:27.990
higher IQ than firstborns.

00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:31.800
By age 18, which is when
this study was carried out,

00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:33.590
it flips the other way around.

00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:36.970
So, any hypotheses for why
this difference occurs?

00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:39.880
Why, by 12 years of
age, latter-borns

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:42.220
tend to have higher
IQs than firstborns?

00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:44.360
Why does that then
flip afterward?

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:45.666
Yeah.

00:21:45.666 --> 00:21:46.166
[INAUDIBLE]

00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:53.640
OK, so is it IQ testing--
some biases with that.

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:55.430
What would rule
against that, though,

00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:58.280
is that the age
controlling for only

00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:01.590
childs-- only children--
versus firstborns.

00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:03.340
So that would definitely
be a possibility.

00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:04.578
That was ruled out.

00:22:04.578 --> 00:22:05.554
Yeah.

00:22:05.554 --> 00:22:07.606
I think that I [INAUDIBLE]
in another class

00:22:07.606 --> 00:22:09.731
that you said it had to do
with the ratio of adults

00:22:09.731 --> 00:22:11.950
in the environment when
the kids were growing up.

00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:13.675
So when there's
only one child, you

00:22:13.675 --> 00:22:18.361
have more adults with higher
language skills, and--

00:22:18.361 --> 00:22:18.860
Good.

00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:23.440
OK, so another version of a
parental-investment model,

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:26.380
there, which is, the fewer
the children, the more

00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:27.440
parental energy.

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:30.140
So, again, that's one of the
standard things in the field.

00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:32.670
They ruled that out with
comparing the only children

00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:34.506
versus firstborn child.

00:22:34.506 --> 00:22:36.380
So that's been a dominant
model in the field,

00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:38.119
so they had good
data against that.

00:22:38.119 --> 00:22:38.618
Yeah.

00:22:38.618 --> 00:22:40.312
Could it be the
age of the mother

00:22:40.312 --> 00:22:42.240
when the baby is a fetus?

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:43.130
Oh, OK!

00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:44.438
What's your idea about that?

00:22:44.438 --> 00:22:47.066
Well, younger mothers--
maybe the fetal environment

00:22:47.066 --> 00:22:48.842
is better, and
obviously older children

00:22:48.842 --> 00:22:51.510
have younger mothers than their
siblings whose-- the mother

00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:53.010
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:22:53.010 --> 00:22:55.690
OK, so we've got an
intrauterine effect.

00:22:55.690 --> 00:22:59.830
So we've got egg quality and
age of mom and all of that.

00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:02.520
They controlled for that--
the age of the mother.

00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:06.140
Can anybody think of something--
another intrauterine mechanism,

00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:08.380
though-- for what's the
difference between being

00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:11.830
the first fetus
who hits the womb

00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:14.960
of your mother versus being
the second or third or fourth?

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:17.381
What's one of the biological
things that might happen?

00:23:17.381 --> 00:23:17.880
Yeah.

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:18.660
Stress levels.

00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:19.493
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:24.320
OK, stress levels, which is
a way of stating something

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:25.890
about intrauterine environment.

00:23:25.890 --> 00:23:28.260
The more times you've
done this, perhaps more

00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:29.811
stressed you are in there.

00:23:29.811 --> 00:23:31.810
What else could biologically--
that's definitely

00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:32.559
one of the things.

00:23:32.559 --> 00:23:35.510
What else biologically
can happen, over time?

00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:37.790
Remember progesterone,
the other day,

00:23:37.790 --> 00:23:41.700
from that lecture of
making new if-then clauses

00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:43.399
and glucocorticoids.

00:23:43.399 --> 00:23:44.690
And this is a bit of a stretch.

00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:50.370
This takes some sort of fair
amount of OB/GYN knowledge.

00:23:50.370 --> 00:23:53.160
What's a danger as you have
more and more pregnancies,

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:56.241
in terms of your immune system?

00:23:56.241 --> 00:23:58.230
[INAUDIBLE]

00:23:58.230 --> 00:24:00.700
Yeah-- wait-- I
heard that mumbled!

00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:01.200
Sure!

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:02.140
It gets surpressed?

00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:02.720
Yeah.

00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:04.300
OK, immune suppression.

00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:06.270
So mom could be getting
a lot less healthy,

00:24:06.270 --> 00:24:08.880
which is another version of
tapping into that notion,

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:11.437
there, in terms of
egg quality with age.

00:24:11.437 --> 00:24:14.020
Separate of age, the number of
times you've gone through this.

00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:16.790
What could be another
possibility, immunologically,

00:24:16.790 --> 00:24:18.060
with repeated pregnancies?

00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:19.480
Yeah?

00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:24.490
A mother [INAUDIBLE] more,
like, form antigens [INAUDIBLE]?

00:24:24.490 --> 00:24:28.280
OK, despite that immune
suppression, on the average,

00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:30.940
with later pregnancies you
have a greater likelihood

00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:34.270
of having formed antibodies
against aspects of the fetus.

00:24:34.270 --> 00:24:36.170
They controlled for that.

00:24:36.170 --> 00:24:40.250
They showed, if you
were second-born

00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:43.410
and there were kids after
that-- if you were second-born

00:24:43.410 --> 00:24:48.810
and the firstborn died, you
reverted to the firstborn IQ.

00:24:48.810 --> 00:24:50.890
Showing that it was
not anything about,

00:24:50.890 --> 00:24:53.859
oh, you were the second fetus
in there, with more antibodies.

00:24:53.859 --> 00:24:54.900
They controlled for that.

00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:57.410
That's actually one of the
ideas they brought up in there.

00:24:57.410 --> 00:24:58.600
What else?

00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:00.620
How about that business
about up to age 12,

00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:02.210
the second-born does better?

00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:04.700
After that, by age 18,
the firstborn does better.

00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:05.841
Any theories with that?

00:25:05.841 --> 00:25:06.340
Yeah.

00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:08.805
Did it have to do, maybe,
with how fast they grow,

00:25:08.805 --> 00:25:09.346
or something?

00:25:09.346 --> 00:25:12.030
I know we talked about
how for fathers it's,

00:25:12.030 --> 00:25:16.449
like, a child grows
faster [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:16.449 --> 00:25:18.613
more later [INAUDIBLE]
grow faster then

00:25:18.613 --> 00:25:21.750
that takes a toll on
your [INAUDIBLE] health?

00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:24.980
OK, so an early advantage,
and you pay for it later,

00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:25.490
type deal.

00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:26.860
So that's a possibility.

00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:27.960
What else could come in?

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:30.250
Think about-- back
to the idea, there,

00:25:30.250 --> 00:25:31.810
about if you're a firstborn.

00:25:31.810 --> 00:25:34.320
Some of the firstborn
responsibility stuff.

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:37.250
How that plays out in
family dynamics early on.

00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:39.290
Why are the second-borns
doing better

00:25:39.290 --> 00:25:40.900
in the first dozen years?

00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:42.570
Why is it reversed later on?

00:25:42.570 --> 00:25:43.953
More ideas about that.

00:25:43.953 --> 00:25:45.223
Yeah.

00:25:45.223 --> 00:25:48.535
The second-born benefits
from the tutelage

00:25:48.535 --> 00:25:50.220
of the firstborn early in life.

00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:54.144
But later on, having the
older having had that

00:25:54.144 --> 00:25:56.390
experience of being more
responsible [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:00.260
Exactly.

00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:01.700
That's one of the main theories.

00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:03.930
That's probably the
predominant one proposed

00:26:03.930 --> 00:26:06.650
to explain that age switch.

00:26:06.650 --> 00:26:09.190
You get the second kid
show up, and suddenly you

00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:12.110
have a neotenized,
dumbed-down environment,

00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:13.740
where suddenly
the 8-year-old kid

00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:16.670
is watching Tinky Winky again
for the first time in six

00:26:16.670 --> 00:26:17.310
years.

00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:20.380
That it's an environment
that's then dominated more

00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:22.450
by having a younger one around.

00:26:22.450 --> 00:26:25.380
And what the older one is
mostly doing is the tutoring.

00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:28.040
And it takes a number of years
for the advantages of that

00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:29.310
to finally come through.

00:26:29.310 --> 00:26:32.120
That's the main model
that's given for that.

00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:33.480
Any other ideas?

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:35.900
How about
parental-resource stuff?

00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:39.200
The fact that the larger
the family, on the average,

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:43.320
in westernized countries, the
lower the socioeconomic status?

00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:44.290
Run with that one.

00:26:44.290 --> 00:26:45.510
Where does that fit in?

00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:50.130
What else?

00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:51.411
What else could be
happening with that?

00:26:51.411 --> 00:26:51.911
Yeah.

00:26:51.911 --> 00:26:54.551
If the socioeconomic status
of the family is lower,

00:26:54.551 --> 00:26:56.728
then wouldn't that suggest
that the children might

00:26:56.728 --> 00:27:00.206
bear more burden, in some
respects, with more children

00:27:00.206 --> 00:27:02.206
around, so that they had
to grow up more quickly

00:27:02.206 --> 00:27:05.890
and be exposed to
the real world?

00:27:05.890 --> 00:27:08.710
It's the later ones who are
out hunting squirrels and not

00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:10.260
getting the violin lessons.

00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:13.760
That's another version of the
parental-resource one, one

00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:16.370
being because there's a
smaller ratio of parents

00:27:16.370 --> 00:27:19.120
to the kids, the other being
because the more kids, the more

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:21.765
expensive for the
same parental income.

00:27:21.765 --> 00:27:24.070
And you have got less
to spread to each child.

00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:27.450
So they controlled for that,
looking at within family

00:27:27.450 --> 00:27:29.370
rather than just between family.

00:27:29.370 --> 00:27:30.715
They covered all of this.

00:27:30.715 --> 00:27:33.660
This is going to be
the definitive study

00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:36.290
for the rest of all of
time, showing what's

00:27:36.290 --> 00:27:40.160
going on with IQ by birth
order in 18-year-olds in Norway

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:42.460
in 2007.

00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:46.420
What was the magnitude of the
difference for this study?

00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:51.580
2.3 IQ points.

00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:54.410
And thus, coming
back to what could

00:27:54.410 --> 00:27:56.530
have been the very first
question sitting there

00:27:56.530 --> 00:27:58.360
when these guys were
ready to announce this

00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:02.200
to the world and
sort of start selling

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:05.430
their "be like a firstborn
IQ" self-help books and all

00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:06.180
of that.

00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:09.070
Lost in there-- and this was
picked up all over the press

00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:12.120
and, like, no doubt, endless
snotty comments by David

00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:13.320
Letterman or--

00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:17.660
And nobody-- 2.3 IQ points!

00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:20.170
You sneeze while you're
taking an IQ test

00:28:20.170 --> 00:28:22.710
and have to wipe your nose
for eight seconds afterward,

00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:26.040
and that's going to cost you
2.3 IQ points, because you

00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:27.780
get distracted for a second.

00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:31.870
An amazing example of this
whole business of-- yes,

00:28:31.870 --> 00:28:35.130
impeccable science that these
people did-- phenomenal!

00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:37.590
I don't know who possibly
gave them the money

00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:39.090
to do a study like this.

00:28:39.090 --> 00:28:41.450
And at the end of the
day, totally cool,

00:28:41.450 --> 00:28:45.580
irrefutable, statistically
totally reliable--

00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:49.367
which is very different
from saying "important."

00:28:49.367 --> 00:28:50.950
But what you get at
the end of the day

00:28:50.950 --> 00:28:54.750
was this mammoth study
producing 2.3 difference.

00:28:54.750 --> 00:28:57.040
And this is a great
demonstration.

00:28:57.040 --> 00:29:00.070
The difference between
how solid the science

00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:03.660
is, how confident you are
of the finding-- which

00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:07.280
takes in all the variables of
sample size and objectivity--

00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:09.790
how confident you
are of the finding,

00:29:09.790 --> 00:29:12.320
and how big of a finding it is.

00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:14.730
And those could be two
entire differences.

00:29:14.730 --> 00:29:16.730
So, as a [INAUDIBLE] you
to all the stuff that's

00:29:16.730 --> 00:29:19.150
going to come in the second
half of the course, one

00:29:19.150 --> 00:29:21.530
of the next tools you
have to have in mind,

00:29:21.530 --> 00:29:23.670
in addition to all the
ones that were apparent

00:29:23.670 --> 00:29:26.280
here in the questions you
were asking-- another one

00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:29.530
is to keep saying, well,
is this a big effect?

00:29:29.530 --> 00:29:31.630
"Is this a reliable
effect?" is different

00:29:31.630 --> 00:29:35.130
from "Is this a big effect?"
"Is this a consequential one?"

00:29:35.130 --> 00:29:37.370
So, another tool
to have in hand.

00:29:37.370 --> 00:29:39.950
So, with that in hand, go
and tell everybody tonight

00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:41.060
about Chutes and Ladders.

00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:41.560
OK.

00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:43.805
So what we jump to
now is something

00:29:43.805 --> 00:29:46.180
that's been running through
a whole bunch of the lectures

00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:47.280
already.

00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:50.070
OK, we've got all those
evolutionary models

00:29:50.070 --> 00:29:53.240
of individual selection and
kin selection and in-group

00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:54.100
and out-group.

00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:56.680
And we've got something
about the molecular biology

00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:59.710
of why it is that you
share 50% of your genes

00:29:59.710 --> 00:30:03.007
with this relative and 25 and
12 and a half, and all of that.

00:30:03.007 --> 00:30:05.090
And somewhere in there,
lurking through all of it,

00:30:05.090 --> 00:30:06.630
is a question
which is what we'll

00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:10.710
focus on now, which is, how
do organisms, how do animals,

00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:13.910
how do individuals
recognize relatives?

00:30:13.910 --> 00:30:17.650
Because you can't do any of
that evolutionary-biology,

00:30:17.650 --> 00:30:21.080
kin-selection-theory stuff,
where it's all predicated

00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:24.650
on degree of relatedness,
unless you know how related

00:30:24.650 --> 00:30:26.510
am I with this individual.

00:30:26.510 --> 00:30:29.780
So what we're going to be
looking at, here, is, why--

00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:33.740
or how-- sure, let's go for
"how" instead of "why"--

00:30:33.740 --> 00:30:38.000
how do animals, how do social
animals, recognize kin?

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.027
What's clear is, it does not
take a very fancy organism.

00:30:42.027 --> 00:30:43.610
And there was a great
example of this,

00:30:43.610 --> 00:30:46.026
which I think I stuck in the
extended notes, last minute--

00:30:46.026 --> 00:30:50.680
a paper published just a couple
weeks ago looking at deer mice.

00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:53.620
Deer mice, and much like
their vole cousins--

00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:56.570
if they are cousins--
some deer-mice strains are

00:30:56.570 --> 00:30:58.642
monogamous, and
some are polygamous.

00:30:58.642 --> 00:31:00.100
This appears to be
a frequent theme

00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:01.770
in these little rodent things.

00:31:01.770 --> 00:31:04.020
And with the deer
mice, what you find

00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:07.310
is, with the polygamous
ones one female mates

00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:08.420
with a bunch of males.

00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:10.420
And as a result,
one female will have

00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:13.970
sperm from a number of different
males afterward in the vagina.

00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:16.580
And what you get
is, evolutionarily,

00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:20.000
from all the rules we learned
by now, perfectly logically,

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.460
you get intrasexual
competition between the sperm

00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:25.990
from the different males.

00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:27.610
We already heard
a version of that

00:31:27.610 --> 00:31:29.400
with the flies,
back the other week,

00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:31.630
there, where the
sperm of one releases

00:31:31.630 --> 00:31:34.140
toxins that kill the other
sperm but in the process could

00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:36.530
damage the female's
future-- all of that.

00:31:36.530 --> 00:31:39.500
This is a theme that runs
through a lot of the literature

00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:41.270
on sexual competition.

00:31:41.270 --> 00:31:42.442
Sperm competition.

00:31:42.442 --> 00:31:44.400
And there's even hints
that something like that

00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:45.310
goes on in humans.

00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:45.810
OK.

00:31:45.810 --> 00:31:47.890
So what form does it take?

00:31:47.890 --> 00:31:50.430
In these deer mice, as follows.

00:31:50.430 --> 00:31:54.370
I don't begin to understand
the mechanics of this,

00:31:54.370 --> 00:31:55.540
nor do I want to.

00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:58.560
But apparently, with
deer-mice sperm,

00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:00.830
if they all clump
together-- you know,

00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:03.440
many hands on the
oars, or something.

00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:06.950
If they all clump together,
you get this macro sperm thing

00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:09.910
which swims upstream faster.

00:32:09.910 --> 00:32:12.000
And the paper had
all sorts of diagrams

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.750
of this which I did not want
to look at in much detail.

00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:15.770
But there's this--

00:32:15.770 --> 00:32:19.370
So you've got-- with
the polygamous strains,

00:32:19.370 --> 00:32:20.520
you've got this problem.

00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:23.570
If your sperm want to do
things absolutely correctly,

00:32:23.570 --> 00:32:26.580
they only want to form
one of these big-old,

00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:30.680
you know, pleasure-boat
aggregate crew things,

00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:34.700
with sperm from themselves--
with sperm from only

00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:35.510
themselves.

00:32:35.510 --> 00:32:38.310
And, following all
of our theorizing,

00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:42.280
to a lesser extent with close
relatives and not at all with

00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:44.420
sperm from some other guy.

00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:47.470
And that's precisely what
they showed in this paper.

00:32:47.470 --> 00:32:50.730
You take sperm from
monogamous strains,

00:32:50.730 --> 00:32:52.730
and you put sperm from
different males together,

00:32:52.730 --> 00:32:56.290
and they all happily form this
big cooperative clump of sperm,

00:32:56.290 --> 00:32:56.790
there.

00:32:56.790 --> 00:32:58.610
But you take them
from species that

00:32:58.610 --> 00:33:02.500
have evolved under the
selective pressure of polygamy,

00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:06.050
and the sperm there know
who they're related to

00:33:06.050 --> 00:33:10.170
and will form these clumps only
with the ones from themselves.

00:33:10.170 --> 00:33:14.180
You can immediately design all
sorts of lock-and-key stories

00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:15.430
for how it's pulled off.

00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:18.690
You could immediately come
up with some approximation

00:33:18.690 --> 00:33:20.570
of what the molecular
mechanism would be.

00:33:20.570 --> 00:33:23.270
But for a first pass,
what's striking here is, oh,

00:33:23.270 --> 00:33:26.100
how do organisms
recognize relatives?

00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:28.300
There are, out
there, single cells

00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:31.290
that can do this under
exactly the evolutionary

00:33:31.290 --> 00:33:33.830
circumstances-- models
that we've got already.

00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:37.150
So, as we begin to look, now,
at how whole organisms do it,

00:33:37.150 --> 00:33:38.520
even cells can do it.

00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:41.950
And we're going to see lots of
different possible mechanisms.

00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:45.650
In lots of species, what you
have is some equivalent of what

00:33:45.650 --> 00:33:47.740
those single sperm
are doing, which is,

00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:51.680
there is innate
recognition of relatives.

00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:53.360
How do you show this?

00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:56.500
We already know the classic
ways of doing this, which is

00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:58.640
the crossed-fostering approach.

00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:02.650
You take a litter, newborn
litter, of your rodents,

00:34:02.650 --> 00:34:04.910
and you cross-foster
them to other females.

00:34:04.910 --> 00:34:06.860
And if, later on,
they can behaviorally

00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:10.828
differentiate between their
siblings and nonsiblings,

00:34:10.828 --> 00:34:12.244
there's something
innate about it.

00:34:12.244 --> 00:34:12.469
Oh!

00:34:12.469 --> 00:34:13.370
Wait a second, wait a second.

00:34:13.370 --> 00:34:14.810
What about prenatal environment?

00:34:14.810 --> 00:34:16.639
Wasn't there something
about-- so now you

00:34:16.639 --> 00:34:19.230
do the prenatal
cross-fostering--

00:34:19.230 --> 00:34:21.489
the fetal-transplant
approach-- and you get

00:34:21.489 --> 00:34:22.830
the exact same thing.

00:34:22.830 --> 00:34:26.159
There is innate
recognition of relatedness

00:34:26.159 --> 00:34:28.190
in all sorts of rodent species.

00:34:28.190 --> 00:34:30.449
Another way of doing
it even cleaner.

00:34:30.449 --> 00:34:36.150
You have two different litters
from the same mother and father

00:34:36.150 --> 00:34:37.080
rodent.

00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:38.570
And then they meet together.

00:34:38.570 --> 00:34:41.510
So there was no shared
prenatal environment.

00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:43.889
And you can show
recognition there.

00:34:43.889 --> 00:34:46.770
You put the rat, later
on, into the cage where

00:34:46.770 --> 00:34:49.380
there is the urine
of its sibling,

00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:51.280
and there is the urine
of a perfect stranger,

00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:54.260
and they will prefer
going to that one.

00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:56.840
You could show that it's
even more subtle than that.

00:34:56.840 --> 00:35:00.950
They will prefer to go to
the urine of a full sibling

00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:04.200
versus a half sibling, a half
sibling versus a first cousin--

00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:05.840
all the way on down.

00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:08.660
They could take it out to
about third or fourth cousins.

00:35:08.660 --> 00:35:12.270
Incredible discrimination,
there, that can go into it.

00:35:12.270 --> 00:35:15.620
And it has to be that way, or
else all of the theorizing from

00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:18.430
the other day-- you can't figure
out how to give up your life

00:35:18.430 --> 00:35:21.130
for two cousins or eight
brothers or eight brothers or--

00:35:21.130 --> 00:35:21.630
[FEEDBACK]

00:35:21.630 --> 00:35:23.480
--two cousins, or
whatever the math

00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:25.670
is, unless you know who's who.

00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:28.800
And in some species where it's
done entirely instinctually,

00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:31.100
that would be the way
you demonstrate it.

00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:34.120
So what's the mechanism,
, there, in those cases?

00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:36.960
The most-studied
ones are olfactory.

00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:38.870
Olfactory signatures.

00:35:38.870 --> 00:35:42.050
"Pheromones"-- we've already
heard that term in here.

00:35:42.050 --> 00:35:43.920
We're going to hear
tons more about it.

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:46.790
But pheromonal communication.

00:35:46.790 --> 00:35:49.300
What does that begin to require?

00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:52.950
If you have pheromones,
odorants, coming out of, say,

00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:54.940
the urine from
different individuals,

00:35:54.940 --> 00:35:57.840
telling you your degree
of relatedness to them,

00:35:57.840 --> 00:35:59.770
it requires two things.

00:35:59.770 --> 00:36:04.320
It requires qualitative
differences in the urine,

00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:07.920
reflecting the genetic makeup
of the individual who provided

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:09.670
that urine to the grad student.

00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:14.430
And it requires some mechanism,
some olfactory brain-processing

00:36:14.430 --> 00:36:18.670
mechanism, to be able to pick up
whatever those differences are.

00:36:18.670 --> 00:36:20.730
And both have been shown.

00:36:20.730 --> 00:36:21.680
OK.

00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:24.040
The way you begin to
get the differentiation

00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:27.760
at the end of how the
urine smells differently.

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:30.280
What you've got--
and referred to back

00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:33.080
with the transposable
stuff is-- you remember,

00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:36.560
in vertebrates you've got
some of your highest rates

00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:39.250
of transposable events
in your immune system,

00:36:39.250 --> 00:36:42.431
your genes devoted to immunity,
where you juggle them around.

00:36:42.431 --> 00:36:44.180
And that's how, with
any luck, you come up

00:36:44.180 --> 00:36:47.060
with an antibody that will
recognize this completely

00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:49.060
novel pathogen. All of that.

00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:51.240
There's an additional
stretch of genes

00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:54.310
in that neighborhood where
what happens with that is,

00:36:54.310 --> 00:36:58.520
it also undergoes huge amounts
of splicing and transposition

00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:00.220
and juggling and all of that.

00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:04.310
And what do you do then is,
you create a completely unique

00:37:04.310 --> 00:37:05.140
protein.

00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:07.930
You do it in enough
of a combinatorial way

00:37:07.930 --> 00:37:12.600
that it would take
statistically 400 quadrillion

00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:15.800
googleflex-whatevers to come
up with another organism

00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:19.470
with the exact same
protein signature.

00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:21.600
When you make a
protein from that,

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:24.800
you have made up one that no
other organism on earth has,

00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:27.580
with a very high
statistical reliability.

00:37:27.580 --> 00:37:29.790
This is a stretch
of genes called

00:37:29.790 --> 00:37:34.690
the "major histocompatibility
complex"-- MHCs.

00:37:34.690 --> 00:37:38.770
And what you see with those
is histocompatibility,

00:37:38.770 --> 00:37:41.150
that whole business with
organ transplants-- how

00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:45.220
compatible of a donor is
it, how closely related,

00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:48.150
how much of this--
jargon, for those of you

00:37:48.150 --> 00:37:51.390
who know it-- how much of a
shared antigenic determinant,

00:37:51.390 --> 00:37:55.752
how genetically similar is this
fingerprint, this identifying

00:37:55.752 --> 00:37:58.150
ID of a protein?

00:37:58.150 --> 00:38:01.490
That determines things
like histocompatibility--

00:38:01.490 --> 00:38:03.360
how well organ transfers work.

00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:05.020
That's the origins of the term.

00:38:05.020 --> 00:38:08.230
So every single one of us,
every single organism out there,

00:38:08.230 --> 00:38:11.720
has made an arguably unique
juggle of these genes

00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:14.170
and comes up with
this signature protein

00:38:14.170 --> 00:38:18.160
that it sticks on the surface of
every single one of its cells.

00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:19.810
What's that good for?

00:38:19.810 --> 00:38:22.140
That's good for
your immune system

00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:25.370
learning, if we run into a
cell with one of those things,

00:38:25.370 --> 00:38:26.230
it's us.

00:38:26.230 --> 00:38:27.340
Don't attack it.

00:38:27.340 --> 00:38:29.476
Don't form antibodies
against it.

00:38:29.476 --> 00:38:31.350
And if we run into
anything else in here that

00:38:31.350 --> 00:38:33.640
doesn't have one of those,
it's an invasive pathogen,

00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:34.830
and go attack it.

00:38:34.830 --> 00:38:39.260
This is the basis of the
self/nonself recognition

00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:41.340
ability of the immune system.

00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:44.110
And what autoimmune diseases
are is when your immune system

00:38:44.110 --> 00:38:48.410
screws up and begins to mistake
one of your signature proteins,

00:38:48.410 --> 00:38:50.980
your major
histocompatibility gene

00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:54.430
derived signature protein,
as, in fact, being invasive.

00:38:54.430 --> 00:38:57.010
And one of the other things
you hear about-- the other day,

00:38:57.010 --> 00:39:00.300
we heard about this tropical
parasite, trypanosome.

00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:02.550
What it does, as
you heard, was it

00:39:02.550 --> 00:39:04.890
keeps juggling its
surface proteins.

00:39:04.890 --> 00:39:07.940
So just as your immune system
is all set to attack it,

00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:10.160
because it's got
antibodies to recognize it,

00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:12.670
it has changed its
signature protein.

00:39:12.670 --> 00:39:15.590
There's another tropical
parasite, schistosomes,

00:39:15.590 --> 00:39:20.010
where what they do is they steal
your major histocompatibility

00:39:20.010 --> 00:39:22.750
proteins from the surface
of some of your cells

00:39:22.750 --> 00:39:24.450
and glue it on themselves.

00:39:24.450 --> 00:39:28.680
And they are wolves in a
sheep major histocompatibility

00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:30.370
proteins or some such things.

00:39:30.370 --> 00:39:35.720
So that's one major domain where
this unique protein-- derived

00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:38.370
from a unique gene--
unique protein signature

00:39:38.370 --> 00:39:40.730
lets your immune
system work properly.

00:39:40.730 --> 00:39:43.810
So it turns out there's another
whole domain with it, which

00:39:43.810 --> 00:39:47.240
is, these proteins
can become soluble.

00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:49.870
Which means they're no
longer anchored to a cell,

00:39:49.870 --> 00:39:51.340
they're just floating around.

00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:55.000
And ultimately they're
floating around in your saliva,

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:59.620
in your urine, in your armpit
exudates or whatever it is.

00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:02.860
And what they begin to do--
complicated mechanisms, which

00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:04.240
I think I will bypass.

00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:08.720
What they do is give a unique
signature to the pheromones

00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:10.290
coming off of you.

00:40:10.290 --> 00:40:12.110
And, as we will
see in the lectures

00:40:12.110 --> 00:40:15.520
to come, animals of all
sorts of species can tell,

00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:18.090
is this individual
of my species,

00:40:18.090 --> 00:40:20.140
are they the same gender,
are they an adult,

00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:22.420
are they sexually
mature, are they healthy,

00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:23.720
are they pregnant-- whatever.

00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:25.860
But thanks to this
major-histocompatibility

00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:30.410
business they can also
tell, is this a relative?

00:40:30.410 --> 00:40:33.250
Now the juggling of events,
the splicing and the juggling

00:40:33.250 --> 00:40:37.160
of the genes, has some degree
of statistical relatedness

00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:39.205
the more closely
related you are.

00:40:39.205 --> 00:40:42.940
In other words, you
smell your own urine--

00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:46.090
if that's your hobby-- and the
major histocompatibility genes

00:40:46.090 --> 00:40:49.830
in there will obviously
exactly match your own.

00:40:49.830 --> 00:40:51.970
You smell those of
a full sibling--

00:40:51.970 --> 00:40:54.590
even more questions to be
asked-- and you do that,

00:40:54.590 --> 00:40:58.140
and there will be a greater
degree, statistically,

00:40:58.140 --> 00:41:00.880
of similarity of the
structure of that protein

00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:04.040
than with a second cousin,
than with a perfect stranger,

00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:06.320
than with a Nepalese
if you're from Belgium.

00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:08.920
Whatever it is, what you
find in those cases is,

00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:12.550
that's how you not only
get innate olfactory

00:41:12.550 --> 00:41:14.950
recognition of, is
this a relative or not,

00:41:14.950 --> 00:41:17.630
but how related of a relative?

00:41:17.630 --> 00:41:18.890
So that's half of it.

00:41:18.890 --> 00:41:21.980
That's how you generate
the unique signature

00:41:21.980 --> 00:41:24.700
at the olfaction at
the pheromone end.

00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:27.260
The other trick is,
how do you generate

00:41:27.260 --> 00:41:31.010
an olfactory system that can
make that discrimination?

00:41:31.010 --> 00:41:34.690
And all we've got to go with, at
that point, is-- you can guess,

00:41:34.690 --> 00:41:36.440
if you think about
it a bit-- is,

00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:39.600
we've got to have some
version of olfactory receptors

00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:42.900
that do the old
lock-and-key business.

00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:48.120
Just as you make a protein
which has a certain shape,

00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:50.740
indicating that this is
your unique signature.

00:41:50.740 --> 00:41:52.600
What you want to do
is have receptors

00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:55.620
that will have the uniquely
complimentary shape

00:41:55.620 --> 00:41:58.730
for the lock and key so
that you can do a-- oh!

00:41:58.730 --> 00:42:00.400
This fits perfectly.

00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:03.330
Let's transduce this to a
signal to the brain, saying,

00:42:03.330 --> 00:42:05.820
I'm smelling my armpit.

00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:08.210
And if, instead, you've
got a protein that

00:42:08.210 --> 00:42:11.400
fits in there like a lock and
key but not quite as well,

00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:15.320
you send the message of, oh, I'm
smelling my sibling's armpit.

00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:18.330
And if it fits in there not
quite as well, and all the way

00:42:18.330 --> 00:42:22.200
down, you could begin to see
exactly how you designed this.

00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:26.040
If you've got 1,000 of these
receptors of this shape

00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:28.840
and every single one of them it
has them fitting in well enough

00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:32.460
to stay in there for three
seconds, so that all 1,000

00:42:32.460 --> 00:42:33.850
of them send the signal.

00:42:33.850 --> 00:42:35.670
It takes three seconds
of binding there

00:42:35.670 --> 00:42:37.210
to cause the signal to happen.

00:42:37.210 --> 00:42:40.360
All 1,000 of them send the
signal that means "it's me."

00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:43.650
It doesn't fit quite as well,
so, statistically, only 800

00:42:43.650 --> 00:42:46.860
of them stay in there for three
seconds, so 800 of the cells

00:42:46.860 --> 00:42:49.420
are reporting, oh,
that's a full sibling.

00:42:49.420 --> 00:42:51.290
I don't know if
that's the mechanism.

00:42:51.290 --> 00:42:53.390
But this would be a
way of constructing it.

00:42:53.390 --> 00:42:57.590
That's exactly how it could
be, along the lines of lock

00:42:57.590 --> 00:43:00.990
and key, genes produce
proteins of certain shapes,

00:43:00.990 --> 00:43:02.640
certain functions-- all of that.

00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:04.470
And that's how you
begin to do it.

00:43:04.470 --> 00:43:06.560
What have we just gotten?

00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:10.000
We've gotten a protein--
a molecular basis

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:14.030
of our theorizing, the other
day, of an if/then clause.

00:43:14.030 --> 00:43:17.460
If and only if this
is a close relative,

00:43:17.460 --> 00:43:22.590
then send a message to the
neurons that do "cooperation."

00:43:22.590 --> 00:43:24.010
We already know
that's gibberish,

00:43:24.010 --> 00:43:26.350
to say that there's neurons
that do cooperation.

00:43:26.350 --> 00:43:29.740
But you could begin to see
how this is going to work.

00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:33.630
This is the "if" part of
all the conditional if/then

00:43:33.630 --> 00:43:36.850
clauses built around
degree of relatedness.

00:43:36.850 --> 00:43:38.970
So how does your
olfactory bulb do this?

00:43:38.970 --> 00:43:41.040
Very interestingly,
people are beginning

00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:44.220
to get a sense of two hormones
that are relevant to this.

00:43:44.220 --> 00:43:47.100
One is called
"oxytocin," and the other

00:43:47.100 --> 00:43:49.420
is called "vasopressin."

00:43:49.420 --> 00:43:52.830
And what we will see in lectures
to come is, particularly

00:43:52.830 --> 00:43:55.360
in females, oxytocin
has long been

00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:59.700
known to play some, like,
plumbing, nuts-and-bolts job

00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:04.210
in giving birth, and vasopressin
in uterine contractions.

00:44:04.210 --> 00:44:07.800
And take your average, like,
off-the-rack endocrinologist.

00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:09.320
And what these
hormones are about

00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:13.530
is, like, your uterus
contracting and giving birth.

00:44:13.530 --> 00:44:15.990
But oh, that's so
little of what they do.

00:44:15.990 --> 00:44:18.740
What they're much more
interestingly involved with

00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:20.200
is what happens next.

00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:22.320
Which is now
beginning to learn how

00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:25.750
to recognize the smell
of the individual

00:44:25.750 --> 00:44:27.450
you just gave birth to.

00:44:27.450 --> 00:44:31.280
Because it turns out, what
oxytocin and vasopressin do

00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:34.100
in the olfactory bulbs--
the olfactory system,

00:44:34.100 --> 00:44:36.890
the olfactory equivalent
of your eyes and ears--

00:44:36.890 --> 00:44:40.660
is they tune up the
cells that recognize

00:44:40.660 --> 00:44:43.360
major histocompatibility
signals.

00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:46.700
They make them attuned to,
is this a relative or not?

00:44:46.700 --> 00:44:48.550
And there's an if/then clause.

00:44:48.550 --> 00:44:51.910
If the levels of this hormone
have the certain high levels

00:44:51.910 --> 00:44:54.910
indicating that I
just gave birth,

00:44:54.910 --> 00:44:58.680
and I smell something whose
signature odorants fit really

00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:01.070
well to this
receptor, then this is

00:45:01.070 --> 00:45:03.750
someone who I'm going to nurse
like crazy, unless it turns out

00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:05.440
to be my mother or grandmother.

00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:08.610
OK, let's put it another-- if
they're very little and cutesy

00:45:08.610 --> 00:45:10.280
and make cute little
mewling sounds,

00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:13.125
then I will take care
of them and nurse them

00:45:13.125 --> 00:45:14.440
and all that sort of thing.

00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:17.890
And it's turning out that that's
what oxytocin and vasopressin

00:45:17.890 --> 00:45:18.760
are doing in there.

00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:22.260
You generate mice with
genetically-- knocking out

00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:25.650
oxytocin or vasopressin
or their receptors--

00:45:25.650 --> 00:45:28.380
if these are totally new terms,
this will come by the week

00:45:28.380 --> 00:45:30.420
after next, as an introduction.

00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:33.150
You knock out those
genes, and you get what

00:45:33.150 --> 00:45:36.130
is called a "social anosmia."

00:45:36.130 --> 00:45:38.730
Anosmia is the inability
to smell something.

00:45:38.730 --> 00:45:42.200
A social anosmia is, your
nose is working just fine--

00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:44.580
if you're a rat, you could
discriminate different food

00:45:44.580 --> 00:45:47.460
types-- completely
arbitrary odors-- you just

00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:50.290
can't distinguish
between individuals.

00:45:50.290 --> 00:45:52.380
And there was a paper,
a couple of weeks ago,

00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:55.130
showing for the first time--
what the model has always been

00:45:55.130 --> 00:45:58.340
is that circulating
oxytocin and vasopressin

00:45:58.340 --> 00:46:00.940
get into your olfactory
system and have those effects.

00:46:00.940 --> 00:46:03.120
What this paper showed
for the first time is,

00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:06.330
you're making those hormones
right in your nostrils,

00:46:06.330 --> 00:46:07.380
to begin with.

00:46:07.380 --> 00:46:09.270
This is what tunes it up.

00:46:09.270 --> 00:46:11.780
Very interestingly,
there is also

00:46:11.780 --> 00:46:15.960
a literature emerging
suggesting mutations

00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:18.950
in genes relevant to
oxytocin and vasopressin

00:46:18.950 --> 00:46:22.800
in families with a high
incidence of autism.

00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:27.170
Autism, a disease where-- one
way of characterizing it is,

00:46:27.170 --> 00:46:30.940
there are enormous deficits
in normal socialization

00:46:30.940 --> 00:46:34.620
interaction, social
bonding, social affiliation.

00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:37.740
And this suggests that has
something to do with it.

00:46:37.740 --> 00:46:39.510
OK, so that's a first mechanism.

00:46:39.510 --> 00:46:41.340
That's how it might
work innately.

00:46:41.340 --> 00:46:46.570
Very cool study in recent years,
also showing one facet of this.

00:46:46.570 --> 00:46:49.610
One of the things you get
taught in Intro Neuro--

00:46:49.610 --> 00:46:52.690
if you've taken anytime
in the last 5,000 years--

00:46:52.690 --> 00:46:54.760
is, when you've
got an adult brain,

00:46:54.760 --> 00:46:56.684
it doesn't make
any more neurons.

00:46:56.684 --> 00:46:58.850
You've got all the neurons
you're ever going to get,

00:46:58.850 --> 00:47:00.308
by the time you're
three years old,

00:47:00.308 --> 00:47:03.830
and all you can do thereafter
is squander them away on, like,

00:47:03.830 --> 00:47:06.320
stupid weekend
binges or whatever.

00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:09.250
And it turns out that,
nonetheless, this is not true.

00:47:09.250 --> 00:47:12.110
And arguably this is the biggest
revolution in neuroscience

00:47:12.110 --> 00:47:13.540
in the last decade or so.

00:47:13.540 --> 00:47:16.070
Adult "neurogenesis."

00:47:16.070 --> 00:47:18.260
And it turns out, this
adult neurogenesis

00:47:18.260 --> 00:47:20.690
happens in only two
areas in the brain.

00:47:20.690 --> 00:47:23.310
The first one is
really interesting.

00:47:23.310 --> 00:47:26.550
Because it's this part of the
brain called the "hippocampus."

00:47:26.550 --> 00:47:29.460
Hippocampus-- learning, memory.

00:47:29.460 --> 00:47:31.290
It's totally cool.

00:47:31.290 --> 00:47:33.550
And a gazillion studies
now showing stuff

00:47:33.550 --> 00:47:37.510
like, you learn a new fact,
you stimulate neurogenesis

00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:38.690
in your hippocampus.

00:47:38.690 --> 00:47:41.050
You get put in an
enriched environment,

00:47:41.050 --> 00:47:43.430
you exercise, you do
all sorts of stuff--

00:47:43.430 --> 00:47:45.210
you make new neurons there.

00:47:45.210 --> 00:47:48.570
You get stressed, you make
less new neurons there.

00:47:48.570 --> 00:47:50.320
This whole new field.

00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:54.610
And 99% of the studies have
been about these populations

00:47:54.610 --> 00:47:57.400
of neural stem cells
in the hippocampus.

00:47:57.400 --> 00:48:00.980
Totally ignored has been
the second, little pocket

00:48:00.980 --> 00:48:03.530
of these neural stem cells
that can make new neurons.

00:48:03.530 --> 00:48:04.940
Nobody's interested in it.

00:48:04.940 --> 00:48:05.790
What's this about?

00:48:05.790 --> 00:48:06.760
It's totally boring.

00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:08.420
Where's the second pocket?

00:48:08.420 --> 00:48:11.810
Just behind the olfactory bulb.

00:48:11.810 --> 00:48:14.620
And what this study showed--
and this is one in your reader,

00:48:14.620 --> 00:48:15.700
just at the abstract.

00:48:15.700 --> 00:48:18.510
What it showed was, if
you have a rat right

00:48:18.510 --> 00:48:20.440
around the time
she gets pregnant,

00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:23.660
she starts to make a new
neurons out the wazoo--

00:48:23.660 --> 00:48:26.190
not from the exciting
hippocampal pocket,

00:48:26.190 --> 00:48:28.400
but from this boring,
little olfactory.

00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:31.360
And what goes on with
the onset of pregnancy--

00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:34.780
female rodents do this
massive renovation

00:48:34.780 --> 00:48:38.240
job of all their olfactory
neurons going on, there.

00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:40.060
What it is, they
showed in this study--

00:48:40.060 --> 00:48:42.450
it is driven by the
prolactin levels that

00:48:42.450 --> 00:48:44.020
rise during pregnancy.

00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:45.530
And what have you got there?

00:48:45.530 --> 00:48:47.410
What they showed was,
right around the time

00:48:47.410 --> 00:48:51.870
she gives birth, she's got
this spanking-new, completely

00:48:51.870 --> 00:48:55.060
renovated olfactory
system, just in time

00:48:55.060 --> 00:48:57.990
to do one of the most important
olfactory things of her life,

00:48:57.990 --> 00:49:01.610
which is quickly figure out
which ones are her babies.

00:49:01.610 --> 00:49:04.379
To quickly do the
social bonding to them.

00:49:04.379 --> 00:49:05.920
What hasn't been
tested yet, but what

00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:09.520
I guarantee has to be there, is
that vasopressin and oxytocin

00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:11.900
has to have some sort of
role going on in there.

00:49:11.900 --> 00:49:13.412
Really interesting.

00:49:13.412 --> 00:49:15.060
Interesting implication of this.

00:49:15.060 --> 00:49:16.150
So think about this.

00:49:16.150 --> 00:49:19.080
If you were pregnant-- and
assuming this works in mammals

00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:21.750
other than rodents-- and
if you were pregnant--

00:49:21.750 --> 00:49:24.140
so the whole time you were
pregnant, what's going on?

00:49:24.140 --> 00:49:27.060
You're doing this huge
job of ripping out

00:49:27.060 --> 00:49:31.670
the walls and the plumbing in
your olfactory bulb and, like,

00:49:31.670 --> 00:49:32.680
putting in new stuff.

00:49:32.680 --> 00:49:33.890
And it's a total mess.

00:49:33.890 --> 00:49:36.540
Like, you spend your pregnancy
with your olfactory system

00:49:36.540 --> 00:49:38.250
totally cockeyed.

00:49:38.250 --> 00:49:42.180
No wonder stuff smells
weird, and no wonder foods

00:49:42.180 --> 00:49:44.090
taste weird and all of that.

00:49:44.090 --> 00:49:46.510
There is a whole
adaptationist literature

00:49:46.510 --> 00:49:49.200
out there on, why should
it be that you suddenly

00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:51.880
want pickles and these foods
you can't stand the taste of?

00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:54.760
And it's to avoid
inadvertently eating toxins.

00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:57.670
A really unconvincing,
spandrel-filled

00:49:57.670 --> 00:49:58.970
literature out there.

00:49:58.970 --> 00:50:02.670
It may be an inadvertent
spandrel byproduct of,

00:50:02.670 --> 00:50:04.670
you're ripping apart the
whole olfactory system,

00:50:04.670 --> 00:50:07.500
so you're all set to recognize
the smell of your kids.

00:50:07.500 --> 00:50:09.950
You just got screwy
olfaction and taste

00:50:09.950 --> 00:50:11.730
all throughout pregnancy.

00:50:11.730 --> 00:50:13.630
The main point of
this, though, is,

00:50:13.630 --> 00:50:16.530
this is endocrine
regulation driving,

00:50:16.530 --> 00:50:19.180
not to make you
able to recognize

00:50:19.180 --> 00:50:22.140
a relative-- because you've
already got the genes in place

00:50:22.140 --> 00:50:25.060
for that-- just making sure
that your olfactory bulb is

00:50:25.060 --> 00:50:29.140
at the very best at
that time for doing it.

00:50:29.140 --> 00:50:30.160
OK.

00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:32.350
What else does one want
to know about that?

00:50:32.350 --> 00:50:35.810
OK, one additional thing you
could do with that information.

00:50:35.810 --> 00:50:37.550
Which is, OK, so,
why do you want

00:50:37.550 --> 00:50:38.990
to know who your relatives are?

00:50:38.990 --> 00:50:40.940
It's who you mate with,
it's who you cooperate

00:50:40.940 --> 00:50:42.490
with, it's who you
try to kill, it's

00:50:42.490 --> 00:50:44.823
who you take care of, it's
who-- all that sort of thing.

00:50:44.823 --> 00:50:46.050
All of these domains.

00:50:46.050 --> 00:50:49.410
Also it's who you pay
attention to socially,

00:50:49.410 --> 00:50:51.406
in terms of gossip and such.

00:50:51.406 --> 00:50:54.620
One interesting
study that was shown,

00:50:54.620 --> 00:50:56.952
which was with
baboons-- and this

00:50:56.952 --> 00:50:59.160
was the same folks at the
University of Pennsylvania.

00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:02.460
What they did was they
recorded the voices--

00:51:02.460 --> 00:51:04.160
You notice this
business about playing

00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:06.090
the voices of some
animal in the bushes

00:51:06.090 --> 00:51:08.120
and looking at the
response in everybody else

00:51:08.120 --> 00:51:09.830
is one of these standard tools.

00:51:09.830 --> 00:51:11.720
What they did, in
this case, was,

00:51:11.720 --> 00:51:15.480
the voice of two animals from
that group, from that troop.

00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:20.400
And what we heard was the voice
of the lower-ranking animal

00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:23.410
giving a dominating
vocalization,

00:51:23.410 --> 00:51:25.990
and the voice of the
lower-ranking individual

00:51:25.990 --> 00:51:29.584
giving this terrified
subordinating noise.

00:51:29.584 --> 00:51:31.500
So they obviously were
not getting a terrified

00:51:31.500 --> 00:51:33.230
subordinating noise
out of number 1,

00:51:33.230 --> 00:51:35.510
but they had to sit
around and get recordings

00:51:35.510 --> 00:51:38.070
of number 2 and everybody
else, at some point or other,

00:51:38.070 --> 00:51:39.750
so now they could
put them down there.

00:51:39.750 --> 00:51:41.030
And they would play this.

00:51:41.030 --> 00:51:43.760
So everybody else is sitting
there and saying, what?

00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:46.800
Number 4 is terrified
of number 27?

00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:47.910
What's going on?

00:51:47.910 --> 00:51:51.400
And what they showed was,
everybody paid a huge attention

00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:55.150
to this, if they were hearing--
number 27 was trashing number

00:51:55.150 --> 00:51:57.090
4 if they weren't relatives.

00:51:57.090 --> 00:51:59.240
But if they were
in the same family,

00:51:59.240 --> 00:52:03.500
and there was this dominance
reversal nobody paid attention.

00:52:03.500 --> 00:52:04.840
Crazy relatives.

00:52:04.840 --> 00:52:06.680
Who knows what's going
on in that family?

00:52:06.680 --> 00:52:07.860
They're just squabbling.

00:52:07.860 --> 00:52:10.480
They distinguish the
social implications

00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:12.800
of a dominance
reversal, depending

00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:15.110
on relatedness or not.

00:52:15.110 --> 00:52:16.980
One additional thing
with it, before we

00:52:16.980 --> 00:52:19.290
go to our next way of
recognizing relatives,

00:52:19.290 --> 00:52:21.780
after the break-- hold on.

00:52:21.780 --> 00:52:23.570
One additional
thing is, of course,

00:52:23.570 --> 00:52:26.087
telling you who to mate with.

00:52:26.087 --> 00:52:28.170
And it's obvious who you're
supposed to mate with,

00:52:28.170 --> 00:52:29.800
in species after
species-- someone

00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:31.210
who is not related to you.

00:52:31.210 --> 00:52:33.450
Because if you do,
you may inadvertently

00:52:33.450 --> 00:52:37.020
produce babies with two
tails and seven fingers

00:52:37.020 --> 00:52:37.770
and all of that.

00:52:37.770 --> 00:52:39.940
Nobody picked up on the
fact that actually we

00:52:39.940 --> 00:52:42.940
have 10 fingers instead of
five, but we'll let that slide.

00:52:42.940 --> 00:52:45.900
But what you get there
is, oh, avoid inbreeding.

00:52:45.900 --> 00:52:48.130
Don't breed with relatives.

00:52:48.130 --> 00:52:51.050
But we've already heard about
a counterargument, which

00:52:51.050 --> 00:52:55.220
is, breed with relatives because
of the inclusive fitness,

00:52:55.220 --> 00:52:58.300
the kin-selection
advantages of doing that.

00:52:58.300 --> 00:52:59.790
And, from the
first minute people

00:52:59.790 --> 00:53:01.940
started getting these
theoretical models,

00:53:01.940 --> 00:53:04.570
it was clear that,
in fact, there

00:53:04.570 --> 00:53:08.250
were contradictory
pulls between doing

00:53:08.250 --> 00:53:11.510
major outbreeding in
your mating and doing

00:53:11.510 --> 00:53:13.000
inbreeding with your mating.

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:15.660
And people did all
these theoretical models

00:53:15.660 --> 00:53:18.480
of econometrics of where
you optimize the difference.

00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:20.280
And they came out
with the conclusion

00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:23.160
that, in all sorts of
species, the optimal balance

00:53:23.160 --> 00:53:26.980
of avoiding inbreeding
disasters with advantages

00:53:26.980 --> 00:53:29.180
of kin selection would
be to mate with something

00:53:29.180 --> 00:53:31.450
like a third cousin.

00:53:31.450 --> 00:53:34.470
And you go and look at all
sorts of species out there,

00:53:34.470 --> 00:53:36.760
and that's precisely
what they do.

00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:38.660
That's where it balances out.

00:53:38.660 --> 00:53:43.150
And, again, you can't do that
unless you know relatedness.

00:53:43.150 --> 00:53:46.650
Then, a couple of years ago,
along came this researcher--

00:53:46.650 --> 00:53:48.900
Martha McClintock,
University of Chicago.

00:53:48.900 --> 00:53:52.060
She's the person who discovered
the Wellesley effect back when.

00:53:52.060 --> 00:53:54.860
And for all of you guys who are
gearing up for senior honors

00:53:54.860 --> 00:53:58.140
theses, this was her senior
honors thesis-- discovering

00:53:58.140 --> 00:53:59.030
the Wellesley effect.

00:53:59.030 --> 00:54:02.170
So this was, like,
one impressive study.

00:54:02.170 --> 00:54:03.230
Yeah?

00:54:03.230 --> 00:54:06.830
Did Darwin marry a second
cousin? [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:06.830 --> 00:54:08.519
Who did-- he married
a first cousin?

00:54:08.519 --> 00:54:09.560
First cousin [INAUDIBLE].

00:54:09.560 --> 00:54:11.630
First cousin.

00:54:11.630 --> 00:54:12.470
There you go.

00:54:12.470 --> 00:54:15.280
When we all know he would much
rather have married a Galapagos

00:54:15.280 --> 00:54:17.122
tortoise, but his
parents forced him--

00:54:17.122 --> 00:54:18.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:18.300 --> 00:54:22.360
Well, interesting exam-- OK,
so you thus catapult us, here,

00:54:22.360 --> 00:54:23.600
into the human realm.

00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:26.010
What McClintock did was a
study, a couple of years

00:54:26.010 --> 00:54:30.280
ago, where she took swabs-- she
has this whole paradigm of very

00:54:30.280 --> 00:54:32.370
high-tech-- getting cotton
balls and rubbing it

00:54:32.370 --> 00:54:34.560
on people's armpits and
putting it in a jar,

00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:36.440
there, and then getting
these volunteers who

00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:39.570
can [SNIFF] smell it and give
some assessment of how good it

00:54:39.570 --> 00:54:40.600
smells or not.

00:54:40.600 --> 00:54:42.630
Which, in and of
itself, is pretty wild.

00:54:42.630 --> 00:54:44.400
And you run that with humans.

00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:48.640
And of a curve of relatedness,
whose odor gets rated

00:54:48.640 --> 00:54:50.760
as having the most appealing?

00:54:50.760 --> 00:54:52.640
Third cousins.

00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:53.410
Yuck!

00:54:53.410 --> 00:54:54.880
Think about that one later.

00:54:54.880 --> 00:54:57.600
We are just another
species, in that regard.

00:54:57.600 --> 00:55:00.350
All of this suggesting,
even in humans,

00:55:00.350 --> 00:55:03.020
you are balancing
this disadvantages

00:55:03.020 --> 00:55:05.720
of inbreeding with the
kin-selection advantages.

00:55:05.720 --> 00:55:09.010
And, again, there's no way you
can do that without knowing

00:55:09.010 --> 00:55:10.870
who's related to what extent.

00:55:10.870 --> 00:55:11.430
OK.

00:55:11.430 --> 00:55:12.580
Five-minute break.

00:55:12.580 --> 00:55:14.590
And what we'll then
transition to are,

00:55:14.590 --> 00:55:17.590
species that don't do
it innately but instead

00:55:17.590 --> 00:55:21.395
have to imprint, early on,
after encountering them.

00:55:25.510 --> 00:55:27.270
OK, let's get going again.

00:55:32.640 --> 00:55:33.220
Let's see.

00:55:33.220 --> 00:55:37.740
First off, thanks to
the wonders of Wikipedia

00:55:37.740 --> 00:55:42.460
never being that far away
from us, we now know-- here

00:55:42.460 --> 00:55:47.620
were Charles Darwin's parents,
who were third cousins.

00:55:47.620 --> 00:55:52.730
And then Charles Darwin
married his first cousin.

00:55:52.730 --> 00:55:55.730
So there you have it--
something or other.

00:55:55.730 --> 00:55:59.000
But this apparently was
rather common at the time.

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:04.990
And is not quite the optimal,
according to Martha McClintock.

00:56:04.990 --> 00:56:05.590
OK.

00:56:05.590 --> 00:56:06.390
So, pushing on.

00:56:06.390 --> 00:56:08.700
So we've now seen
why you would want

00:56:08.700 --> 00:56:11.060
to recognize your
relatives and recognize

00:56:11.060 --> 00:56:12.280
the degree of relatedness.

00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:16.090
All of our models of who to
compete with, who to mate with,

00:56:16.090 --> 00:56:17.590
who to nurse, who
to take care of,

00:56:17.590 --> 00:56:19.210
who to be voyeuristic about.

00:56:19.210 --> 00:56:20.880
And we've seen the
first domain where

00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:25.700
you can do that, which is to
recognize somebody innately.

00:56:25.700 --> 00:56:28.240
And one very confusing
aspect of it,

00:56:28.240 --> 00:56:29.720
which I managed
to make confusing,

00:56:29.720 --> 00:56:32.180
is-- so, what's
up with olfaction

00:56:32.180 --> 00:56:34.940
with that and oxytocin and
vasopressin and prolactin?

00:56:34.940 --> 00:56:36.610
OK, as follows.

00:56:36.610 --> 00:56:41.960
It is innate that you will have
receptors, olfactory receptors,

00:56:41.960 --> 00:56:44.520
in your olfactory neurons,
in your olfactory bulb--

00:56:44.520 --> 00:56:45.320
in your nose.

00:56:45.320 --> 00:56:48.800
It is innate that you will
have olfactory receptors that

00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:52.030
will be able to detect
degree of relatedness--

00:56:52.030 --> 00:56:56.920
how close an olfactory
signature is to your own.

00:56:56.920 --> 00:56:58.070
That is innate.

00:56:58.070 --> 00:56:59.800
That will be there.

00:56:59.800 --> 00:57:04.780
What appears to be the case
is, oxytocin and vasopressin

00:57:04.780 --> 00:57:09.690
make you more likely to make
those receptors-- increase

00:57:09.690 --> 00:57:11.560
the number of those receptors.

00:57:11.560 --> 00:57:15.700
So this is not oxytocin and
vasopressin making you suddenly

00:57:15.700 --> 00:57:17.390
be able to recognize relatives.

00:57:17.390 --> 00:57:19.610
It's just making
you better at doing

00:57:19.610 --> 00:57:21.660
that-- more sensitized to it.

00:57:21.660 --> 00:57:24.540
So that you have 100
receptors reporting instead

00:57:24.540 --> 00:57:27.100
of 10 of them-- more accuracy.

00:57:27.100 --> 00:57:29.790
What prolactin appears
to be doing is--

00:57:29.790 --> 00:57:32.730
and this is under study,
but the best bet is,

00:57:32.730 --> 00:57:36.270
this is another way of getting
more of these olfactory

00:57:36.270 --> 00:57:38.760
receptors online,
right around birth,

00:57:38.760 --> 00:57:41.610
to innately recognize
your relative.

00:57:41.610 --> 00:57:43.580
And this time, instead
of making neurons

00:57:43.580 --> 00:57:45.790
make more copies
of the receptors,

00:57:45.790 --> 00:57:47.367
it's making more neurons.

00:57:47.367 --> 00:57:49.200
There's going to be
more subtlety than that.

00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:51.780
But broadly, those
are two different ways

00:57:51.780 --> 00:57:54.710
of making you better
at doing something

00:57:54.710 --> 00:57:56.710
that is innate in you.

00:57:56.710 --> 00:58:00.420
Rather than making you suddenly
able to learn how to do this.

00:58:00.420 --> 00:58:03.130
So we now transition
to the second way

00:58:03.130 --> 00:58:04.670
in which relatives
are recognized,

00:58:04.670 --> 00:58:06.250
where it's not innate.

00:58:06.250 --> 00:58:08.470
It requires imprinting.

00:58:08.470 --> 00:58:11.870
It requires some sort
of learning which leaves

00:58:11.870 --> 00:58:14.350
a long-lasting message of it.

00:58:14.350 --> 00:58:15.030
Imprinting.

00:58:15.030 --> 00:58:18.330
So now we've got imprinting in
yet another use of the word.

00:58:18.330 --> 00:58:20.620
And major use of it
coming next Monday.

00:58:20.620 --> 00:58:24.670
Imprinting-- how an animal
learns who its mother is.

00:58:24.670 --> 00:58:27.250
How a mother learns
who its babies are.

00:58:27.250 --> 00:58:31.020
How it imprints on the
smell, on the sound,

00:58:31.020 --> 00:58:33.680
on the whatever of its
offspring or parent--

00:58:33.680 --> 00:58:35.640
how that learning goes on.

00:58:35.640 --> 00:58:38.530
What is clear is,
that's a case where

00:58:38.530 --> 00:58:44.250
the learning that the learning
occurs at that point is innate.

00:58:44.250 --> 00:58:48.380
What is learned is experiential.

00:58:48.380 --> 00:58:50.920
Important sort of
distinction, there.

00:58:50.920 --> 00:58:51.420
OK.

00:58:51.420 --> 00:58:52.790
So, what goes on with this?

00:58:52.790 --> 00:58:55.170
So in lots of species,
you learn the sound

00:58:55.170 --> 00:58:56.330
of your infant's voice.

00:58:56.330 --> 00:58:58.360
In lots of species,
you learn the odor.

00:58:58.360 --> 00:59:01.460
In lots of species, you
learn what they look like.

00:59:01.460 --> 00:59:04.270
Different species, different
modalities that dominate.

00:59:04.270 --> 00:59:07.180
What goes into, for
example, learning what

00:59:07.180 --> 00:59:09.100
your offspring smells like?

00:59:09.100 --> 00:59:11.960
Remember, it's not
innate in these cases.

00:59:11.960 --> 00:59:16.220
For example, a goat, a sheep--
whatever-- they do not innately

00:59:16.220 --> 00:59:19.060
have the means of
recognizing, oh, this

00:59:19.060 --> 00:59:21.860
is somebody whose major
histocompatibility proteins are

00:59:21.860 --> 00:59:23.490
fairly similar to mine.

00:59:23.490 --> 00:59:25.730
In fact, they
share 50% homology.

00:59:25.730 --> 00:59:27.650
Oh, this must be my child.

00:59:27.650 --> 00:59:28.710
That's not done that way.

00:59:28.710 --> 00:59:30.210
These are not innate cases.

00:59:30.210 --> 00:59:32.590
So what sort of rules
might you have for how

00:59:32.590 --> 00:59:34.620
to recognize your offspring?

00:59:34.620 --> 00:59:36.090
Here's a simple one.

00:59:36.090 --> 00:59:39.130
OK, there's a whole
bunch of babies out here,

00:59:39.130 --> 00:59:40.862
and which ones are mine?

00:59:40.862 --> 00:59:42.320
And I'm a goat
trying to figure out

00:59:42.320 --> 00:59:43.528
which one I'm going to nurse.

00:59:43.528 --> 00:59:46.310
What would be a good
rule that is not innate,

00:59:46.310 --> 00:59:48.880
instead building on learning
something at that point?

00:59:48.880 --> 00:59:52.130
I know-- I'm going to start
taking care of whichever kid

00:59:52.130 --> 00:59:55.670
there smells like
my vaginal fluids.

00:59:55.670 --> 00:59:58.050
That's a pretty reliable
way of figuring out

00:59:58.050 --> 01:00:00.690
this is somebody you
just gave birth to.

01:00:00.690 --> 01:00:04.350
Or, this is someone who I lick
as they're first coming out.

01:00:04.350 --> 01:00:08.160
And, for a while afterward, I
figure out, who am I nice to?

01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:10.470
Someone who smells
like my saliva.

01:00:10.470 --> 01:00:12.940
Someone who I scent-mark
right after this

01:00:12.940 --> 01:00:15.510
is someone who smells
like my whatever

01:00:15.510 --> 01:00:17.010
glands I'm using, there.

01:00:17.010 --> 01:00:20.190
This is someone who smells
like my amniotic fluid.

01:00:20.190 --> 01:00:22.340
This is someone who,
after I get that learned,

01:00:22.340 --> 01:00:25.010
I then nurse them for the first
time-- this is someone whose

01:00:25.010 --> 01:00:26.850
mouth smells like my milk.

01:00:26.850 --> 01:00:28.370
You could see,
now, in this case,

01:00:28.370 --> 01:00:30.610
it is learning
being built on top

01:00:30.610 --> 01:00:34.550
of whatever your own
recognition system is of smell.

01:00:34.550 --> 01:00:36.500
You can have
elaborations on this.

01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:40.140
How do you recognize a
sibling in species where it is

01:00:40.140 --> 01:00:42.510
learned in this imprinting way?

01:00:42.510 --> 01:00:45.270
Oh, I'm going to imprint as
a relative on somebody who

01:00:45.270 --> 01:00:47.100
smells just like mom.

01:00:47.100 --> 01:00:50.750
Somebody who smells like mom's
vaginal fluid or her saliva

01:00:50.750 --> 01:00:53.100
or any of that same
stuff going on, there.

01:00:53.100 --> 01:00:56.920
Or, I'm going to be nice to
someone who smells like someone

01:00:56.920 --> 01:00:58.320
I mated with back when.

01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:00.880
That's another strategy
in various species.

01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:03.740
You could begin to
see how all of these

01:01:03.740 --> 01:01:07.140
are ways of just getting
logical information.

01:01:07.140 --> 01:01:10.200
Someone who has the
voice like someone

01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:12.970
who I heard peeping when they
were still inside the egg.

01:01:12.970 --> 01:01:13.782
Oh, it's them!

01:01:13.782 --> 01:01:15.990
I'm going to nurse-- no,
I'm not going to nurse them,

01:01:15.990 --> 01:01:19.340
I'm going to give them worms
or whatever it is birds do.

01:01:19.340 --> 01:01:21.950
But all these ways of
using sensory information

01:01:21.950 --> 01:01:24.260
to say, oh, that's the one!

01:01:24.260 --> 01:01:25.280
That's the one.

01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:27.080
That's how I know it's them.

01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:29.730
So, all sorts of ways in
which this could be done.

01:01:29.730 --> 01:01:33.190
How can you prove that this
is not hardwired-- this is not

01:01:33.190 --> 01:01:34.900
absolutely dominating?

01:01:34.900 --> 01:01:37.150
A technique we've been hearing
about already, which is

01:01:37.150 --> 01:01:39.310
that cross-fostering business.

01:01:39.310 --> 01:01:41.760
Which is, you take
newborn whatevers,

01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:44.060
and you switch mothers
on them, and the mothers

01:01:44.060 --> 01:01:45.240
will take care of them.

01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:46.450
What does that tell you?

01:01:46.450 --> 01:01:50.170
It means other attributes
of these pups coming over

01:01:50.170 --> 01:01:52.950
to them-- these rat pups--
override the fact-- wait,

01:01:52.950 --> 01:01:55.610
these kids don't smell
like my vaginal fluid!

01:01:55.610 --> 01:01:58.760
Wow, they're cute, though, and
there's no other moms around,

01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:00.560
and they sure look cuddly, and--

01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:03.940
So maybe it takes you 10 seconds
to decide, this is one of mine,

01:02:03.940 --> 01:02:05.380
instead of three seconds.

01:02:05.380 --> 01:02:07.930
You have different things
being played out, there.

01:02:07.930 --> 01:02:11.440
Contrasting sort of
signals coming through.

01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:14.360
So that's another
domain of doing that.

01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:18.490
So now we move to us and how
we do recognizing relatives.

01:02:18.490 --> 01:02:20.910
And initially what
the answer seems to be

01:02:20.910 --> 01:02:22.980
is that we have a
different version of it.

01:02:22.980 --> 01:02:26.400
We do not recognize
relatives innately,

01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:29.060
nor do we recognize
relatives by imprinting.

01:02:29.060 --> 01:02:33.070
We don't do that deal of, like,
we smell our parents right

01:02:33.070 --> 01:02:35.920
after they're born, or we
sniff the vaginal fluid

01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:38.890
and that's how we know who
mom is forever after, or stuff

01:02:38.890 --> 01:02:39.620
like that.

01:02:39.620 --> 01:02:41.820
So we don't-- instead,
what do we do?

01:02:41.820 --> 01:02:43.930
We do it cognitively.

01:02:43.930 --> 01:02:45.720
We figure it out.

01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:46.790
We think about it.

01:02:46.790 --> 01:02:51.140
We think about it, with active,
conscious, cognitive rules

01:02:51.140 --> 01:02:53.610
of how you know a relative is.

01:02:53.610 --> 01:02:55.590
And, of course, what
we're going to see shortly

01:02:55.590 --> 01:02:58.330
is, that's not really how
it works, a lot of the time.

01:02:58.330 --> 01:03:01.810
But, for a first pass,
we do it cognitively.

01:03:01.810 --> 01:03:03.590
So now you do it--

01:03:03.590 --> 01:03:06.220
Instead of, this is
someone who smells just

01:03:06.220 --> 01:03:08.670
like my vaginal fluid, the
way the goats are doing,

01:03:08.670 --> 01:03:11.396
or, this is someone who I
innately recognize as my child,

01:03:11.396 --> 01:03:13.270
the way the rats are
doing it, you're saying,

01:03:13.270 --> 01:03:16.145
well, that's the baby
I just gave birth to,

01:03:16.145 --> 01:03:18.270
because they haven't taken
him out of the room yet.

01:03:18.270 --> 01:03:21.030
So that must be-- a
cognitive strategy.

01:03:21.030 --> 01:03:24.090
How do I know who the father is?

01:03:24.090 --> 01:03:26.720
Not because I can
smell in the baby's 50%

01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:28.950
sharing their major
histocompatibility gene.

01:03:28.950 --> 01:03:30.950
This is the only
person I had sex

01:03:30.950 --> 01:03:33.140
with during the cycle
that I conceived.

01:03:33.140 --> 01:03:34.740
A cognitive strategy.

01:03:34.740 --> 01:03:36.490
This is what humans
do, again, [INAUDIBLE]

01:03:36.490 --> 01:03:38.010
because we can think.

01:03:38.010 --> 01:03:39.980
We can go through
stuff like that.

01:03:39.980 --> 01:03:42.730
We can also do other
versions of it,

01:03:42.730 --> 01:03:46.814
which is, well, this is someone
who I saw mom give birth to.

01:03:46.814 --> 01:03:48.730
Or at least when they
took me out of the room,

01:03:48.730 --> 01:03:51.100
and then they, like, gave me
some stuffed animals to keep me

01:03:51.100 --> 01:03:52.350
from, like, getting too upset.

01:03:52.350 --> 01:03:54.480
And then they said, here's
your new baby whatever.

01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:55.630
Oh, OK.

01:03:55.630 --> 01:03:57.460
Which is a variant
on, this is someone

01:03:57.460 --> 01:04:00.780
who's been around ever
since I saw mom give birth

01:04:00.780 --> 01:04:01.980
to that individual.

01:04:01.980 --> 01:04:04.300
This is someone
who looks like me.

01:04:04.300 --> 01:04:06.790
This is someone who looks
like a family member.

01:04:06.790 --> 01:04:10.440
All of these cognitive
strategies, going into that.

01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:12.340
We think about it.

01:04:12.340 --> 01:04:13.460
We think about it.

01:04:13.460 --> 01:04:16.470
And, it turns out, we
have brain mechanisms that

01:04:16.470 --> 01:04:18.480
are good for doing that, too.

01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:20.270
But we're not the
only species that

01:04:20.270 --> 01:04:22.330
thinks about it in that way.

01:04:22.330 --> 01:04:26.830
For example, baboons-- wonderful
study, a few years ago.

01:04:26.830 --> 01:04:30.860
Baboons can do this with some
sort of statistical thinking.

01:04:30.860 --> 01:04:32.579
OK, baboons are polygamous.

01:04:32.579 --> 01:04:34.620
Females will mate with a
bunch of different males

01:04:34.620 --> 01:04:37.870
during her cycle, and conceive,
and thus it's not at all clear

01:04:37.870 --> 01:04:39.500
who the father is.

01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:42.250
But everybody there
plays a guessing game.

01:04:42.250 --> 01:04:44.370
And everybody does
some statistics.

01:04:44.370 --> 01:04:46.890
The usual rule
is, baboons, being

01:04:46.890 --> 01:04:49.610
a highly tournament
species-- males do

01:04:49.610 --> 01:04:51.680
no parental care of offspring.

01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:53.490
Turns out that's
not quite the case.

01:04:53.490 --> 01:04:55.180
Some males do.

01:04:55.180 --> 01:04:58.020
When they're pretty
sure who their kid is.

01:04:58.020 --> 01:04:59.790
And here's how it's done.

01:04:59.790 --> 01:05:02.830
You are a baboon, and you
are just hitting puberty.

01:05:02.830 --> 01:05:03.830
You're female.

01:05:03.830 --> 01:05:07.320
And what goes on is, for, like,
your first half dozen cycles,

01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:09.979
you're cycling but you're
probably not ovulating yet.

01:05:09.979 --> 01:05:11.020
You're not quite fertile.

01:05:11.020 --> 01:05:12.710
This happens in humans, as well.

01:05:12.710 --> 01:05:15.200
And none of the big,
high-ranking guys

01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:18.170
are terribly interested in you,
probably because you're not

01:05:18.170 --> 01:05:20.576
pumping out a whole lot of
interesting pheromones yet.

01:05:20.576 --> 01:05:21.700
So who do you wind up with?

01:05:21.700 --> 01:05:24.490
You wind up with some poor,
like, adolescent schnook

01:05:24.490 --> 01:05:26.500
who has no chance to
mate with anybody else.

01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:29.010
And nobody's
contesting his ability

01:05:29.010 --> 01:05:30.630
to have a consortship with you.

01:05:30.630 --> 01:05:32.260
So you do all of
your mating with him.

01:05:32.260 --> 01:05:34.020
The vast majority of the
time, they're not fertile,

01:05:34.020 --> 01:05:35.270
because you're not really ov--

01:05:35.270 --> 01:05:37.190
Every now and then,
though, you get

01:05:37.190 --> 01:05:38.970
this, like,
junior-high-school baboon

01:05:38.970 --> 01:05:41.180
guy who gets his
girlfriend pregnant,

01:05:41.180 --> 01:05:43.030
and he's the only one.

01:05:43.030 --> 01:05:46.350
And what tends to happen then
is, when she gives birth,

01:05:46.350 --> 01:05:50.840
he gives a fair amount of
parental care to the offspring.

01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:52.790
So what does he have
as a rule, there?

01:05:52.790 --> 01:05:54.930
If I'm the only one
who mated with her--

01:05:54.930 --> 01:05:58.340
if they're using a
cognitive strategy-- then

01:05:58.340 --> 01:06:00.300
I'll take care of the
kid to some extent.

01:06:00.300 --> 01:06:03.760
And it is a sight to
behold, how incredibly inept

01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:05.540
an adolescent male
baboon is when

01:06:05.540 --> 01:06:07.290
he's trying to be paternal.

01:06:07.290 --> 01:06:08.960
But what you wind
up seeing there is,

01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:10.750
well, maybe he's imprinted.

01:06:10.750 --> 01:06:14.360
Maybe he's doing major
histocompatibility gene innate

01:06:14.360 --> 01:06:14.870
stuff.

01:06:14.870 --> 01:06:18.460
Or maybe he's actually thinking,
hey, I was with her 24/7,

01:06:18.460 --> 01:06:19.450
so it's gotta be me.

01:06:19.450 --> 01:06:20.880
I'll take care of the kid.

01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:23.250
Now you see the more
complicated circumstance,

01:06:23.250 --> 01:06:26.710
where it's a more desirable
female-- more mature one--

01:06:26.710 --> 01:06:29.520
where there will be a
bunch of males contesting.

01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:32.910
And what you will tend to
see is, two days before

01:06:32.910 --> 01:06:37.270
and after she ovulates, she'll
be mating with number 10.

01:06:37.270 --> 01:06:40.540
A day before and after,
she's mating with number 3.

01:06:40.540 --> 01:06:42.710
The day of ovulation,
she's mating with number 1.

01:06:42.710 --> 01:06:44.250
That tends to be the pattern.

01:06:44.250 --> 01:06:44.990
Stay tuned.

01:06:44.990 --> 01:06:48.040
It doesn't fit that perfectly,
because female baboons also

01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:50.280
have some opinions about
who they want to mate with.

01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:52.240
But, nonetheless,
there winds up being

01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:55.279
this pattern, just like that.

01:06:55.279 --> 01:06:56.820
So there winds up
being this pattern.

01:06:56.820 --> 01:06:58.757
And thus-- you're
the male, afterward,

01:06:58.757 --> 01:07:00.840
when she gives birth, and
you're trying to decide,

01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:02.120
is this my kid?

01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:05.460
Or, should I give some
male parental investment?

01:07:05.460 --> 01:07:09.960
And what is shown is,
baboon males do statistics.

01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:12.210
They do probability.

01:07:12.210 --> 01:07:14.890
What they do is, if
this was a male who

01:07:14.890 --> 01:07:18.810
was mating during her
prime ovulatory day,

01:07:18.810 --> 01:07:21.230
he is more likely to
take care of the kid

01:07:21.230 --> 01:07:23.620
than a male who was
mating during this window

01:07:23.620 --> 01:07:24.740
or this window.

01:07:24.740 --> 01:07:26.840
They are playing probability.

01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:29.430
They're not very good
at it-- no surprise.

01:07:29.430 --> 01:07:31.530
But nonetheless this
pattern emerges.

01:07:31.530 --> 01:07:33.890
That's not innate recognition.

01:07:33.890 --> 01:07:36.840
That's not innate
recognition of some smell.

01:07:36.840 --> 01:07:39.000
That's just thinking through it.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:40.220
Was I with her?

01:07:40.220 --> 01:07:43.760
Yeah, but she sure smelled
a lot better the day after,

01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:45.350
and that other guy
was with her, so I

01:07:45.350 --> 01:07:46.940
guess I'm in this category.

01:07:46.940 --> 01:07:49.630
OK, well, I'll smile at the
kid now and then tell him I

01:07:49.630 --> 01:07:50.720
like their piano playing.

01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:53.500
But I'm not going to,
like, invest anything--

01:07:53.500 --> 01:07:54.710
kind of stuff, there.

01:07:54.710 --> 01:07:58.060
Here, you see a conscious,
cognitive strategy.

01:07:58.060 --> 01:08:01.430
So, OK, so us and other
smart beasties like primates.

01:08:01.430 --> 01:08:06.550
Here's another version of it,
occurring in fish-- in sunfish.

01:08:06.550 --> 01:08:08.790
And this was research
done by that guy

01:08:08.790 --> 01:08:12.120
David Sloan Wilson, that
multilevel-selection-evolution

01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:15.050
evolution guy, who actually
has done research in, like,

01:08:15.050 --> 01:08:16.109
so many different fields.

01:08:16.109 --> 01:08:17.640
Incredibly creative guy.

01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:19.290
Here's a study that he did.

01:08:19.290 --> 01:08:23.270
Sunfish males,
surprisingly, are quite

01:08:23.270 --> 01:08:27.000
paternal in their taking care
of their eventual offspring.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:30.195
They're almost as
good as Nemo's dad.

01:08:30.195 --> 01:08:34.330
And what you've got there
is, in this version, he--

01:08:34.330 --> 01:08:36.500
I'm not going to
draw fish mating.

01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:37.130
Forget that!

01:08:37.130 --> 01:08:37.630
OK.

01:08:37.630 --> 01:08:39.450
So the guy mates
with the female,

01:08:39.450 --> 01:08:42.410
and she eventually
gives birth to kids.

01:08:42.410 --> 01:08:44.140
And he helps take care of them.

01:08:44.140 --> 01:08:46.890
Now, instead, he
mates with a female--

01:08:46.890 --> 01:08:50.149
and you, the savagely
heartless researcher,

01:08:50.149 --> 01:08:51.720
puts him in the next
tank over, where

01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:53.430
he can see what's happening.

01:08:53.430 --> 01:08:56.470
And you fiendishly,
at that point,

01:08:56.470 --> 01:09:00.470
drop down a clear plastic
box right next to the female,

01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:02.837
with another male in there!

01:09:02.837 --> 01:09:04.670
In reality, he's not
mating with the female,

01:09:04.670 --> 01:09:05.544
but he's right there.

01:09:05.544 --> 01:09:07.965
And this guy, who's stuck on
the other side of the barrier

01:09:07.965 --> 01:09:11.810
and going out of his mind
with jealousy and petulance

01:09:11.810 --> 01:09:13.550
and all of that immature stuff.

01:09:13.550 --> 01:09:15.899
And what happens is,
after she eventually

01:09:15.899 --> 01:09:18.260
gives birth, she-- this
apparently being the female,

01:09:18.260 --> 01:09:19.220
in this diagram.

01:09:19.220 --> 01:09:22.080
After she gives birth, he
doesn't take care of the kids

01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:23.000
as much.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:26.260
There is no difference in
any of the sensory cues.

01:09:26.260 --> 01:09:28.500
Because he, in fact, is
the only one who mated.

01:09:28.500 --> 01:09:29.760
This one is kept inside.

01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:34.170
There is some sort of cognitive
stuff even going on in a fish.

01:09:34.170 --> 01:09:35.729
Remarkable.

01:09:35.729 --> 01:09:37.810
So it's not just us.

01:09:37.810 --> 01:09:40.590
So we've got this broad
realm-- innate strategies.

01:09:40.590 --> 01:09:44.250
One's on very all-or-none
sensory imprinting.

01:09:44.250 --> 01:09:46.700
And then there's the folks
who think through it.

01:09:46.700 --> 01:09:49.540
We're in the mainstream of that,
but we're not the only ones.

01:09:49.540 --> 01:09:51.760
So how do our brains do that?

01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:55.130
There is a part of the human
cortex called the "fusiform

01:09:55.130 --> 01:09:56.000
cortex."

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:59.520
And what it's good at
is recognizing faces,

01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:01.670
which is a remarkable thing.

01:10:01.670 --> 01:10:06.020
It specializes in recognizing
faces, facial expression,

01:10:06.020 --> 01:10:07.600
degree of relatedness.

01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:10.705
You show someone a good
portrait of someone else,

01:10:10.705 --> 01:10:12.330
and you will get that
part of the brain

01:10:12.330 --> 01:10:14.480
to activate as if
it was their face.

01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:16.520
You show a good
cartoon of somebody.

01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:18.620
It will do the same thing,
maybe with a little bit

01:10:18.620 --> 01:10:19.640
less confidence.

01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:22.500
This is the specialized
part of the cortex

01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:24.510
that does facial recognition.

01:10:24.510 --> 01:10:26.000
Remarkable.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:29.820
You look at people with autism,
and this part of the cortex

01:10:29.820 --> 01:10:31.490
doesn't do a whole lot.

01:10:31.490 --> 01:10:33.740
You show a
nonautistic individual

01:10:33.740 --> 01:10:37.580
a picture of a
well-known loved one.

01:10:37.580 --> 01:10:39.414
Fusiform cortex
activates a whole lot.

01:10:39.414 --> 01:10:40.830
You show them a
picture of someone

01:10:40.830 --> 01:10:42.270
they don't know a whole lot.

01:10:42.270 --> 01:10:44.180
It activates somewhat
to a lesser degree.

01:10:44.180 --> 01:10:46.840
You show them a
picture of an armchair.

01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:48.350
Doesn't do anything at all.

01:10:48.350 --> 01:10:51.230
You take someone who is
autistic, and you show them,

01:10:51.230 --> 01:10:55.660
and you get the same low-degree
activation for all three.

01:10:55.660 --> 01:10:59.820
You know, mother equals
stranger equals armchair.

01:10:59.820 --> 01:11:03.120
This in some ways is the
core of what autism is about.

01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:07.420
You see that going on, as played
out in this part of the cortex.

01:11:07.420 --> 01:11:09.082
So that's really interesting.

01:11:09.082 --> 01:11:11.290
And then it turns out we're
not the only species that

01:11:11.290 --> 01:11:14.040
has this specialized
fusiform cortex.

01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:17.030
Primates have this, as
well-- nonhuman primates.

01:11:17.030 --> 01:11:18.790
Sheep have it, it turns out.

01:11:18.790 --> 01:11:21.794
Pigeons who could recognize
pictures of each other.

01:11:21.794 --> 01:11:23.710
And why they would want
to do that, god knows.

01:11:23.710 --> 01:11:29.960
But pigeons have a very proto
version of the fusiform cortex.

01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:31.990
This seems to be
part of what goes

01:11:31.990 --> 01:11:36.270
into this conscious, cognitive
strategizing of, this

01:11:36.270 --> 01:11:38.220
is a face, this is
a face I've seen

01:11:38.220 --> 01:11:39.870
a whole lot more over the years.

01:11:39.870 --> 01:11:41.900
So this activates a lot more.

01:11:41.900 --> 01:11:46.540
This seems to suggest some
sort of cortical specialization

01:11:46.540 --> 01:11:49.660
for recognizing individuals.

01:11:49.660 --> 01:11:51.840
More features of
how humans do it.

01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:53.820
Something that humans
are very good at,

01:11:53.820 --> 01:11:56.560
if they are human
mothers, is recognizing

01:11:56.560 --> 01:11:59.790
the smell of their
baby right after birth.

01:11:59.790 --> 01:12:03.170
And this has been shown to
have a major histocompatibility

01:12:03.170 --> 01:12:04.400
component to it.

01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:08.040
In other words, that's not
a purely cognitive strategy.

01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:11.640
There's some innate,
instinctual olfactory

01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:13.200
signaling going on there.

01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:16.200
So, a first bit of
evidence is that we are not

01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:18.400
just purely rational
beasts at figuring out

01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:19.900
who we're related to.

01:12:19.900 --> 01:12:22.420
Babies, very
shortly after birth,

01:12:22.420 --> 01:12:25.430
are already spectacularly good
at distinguishing the smell

01:12:25.430 --> 01:12:27.230
of Mom versus somebody else.

01:12:27.230 --> 01:12:28.980
How do you tell
that with a baby?

01:12:28.980 --> 01:12:32.510
You take a newborn baby, and you
give them, like, on this side,

01:12:32.510 --> 01:12:37.150
some armpit smell of Mom, and
there's some armpit smell of,

01:12:37.150 --> 01:12:39.650
you know-- I don't
know-- Margaret Thatcher.

01:12:39.650 --> 01:12:43.910
And what you see, then, is
that the baby, the newborn,

01:12:43.910 --> 01:12:46.090
is more likely-- will
spend more time turning

01:12:46.090 --> 01:12:47.800
its head towards Mom's smell.

01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:48.950
That's how you know it.

01:12:48.950 --> 01:12:52.050
Newborn babies cannot
distinguish between the smell

01:12:52.050 --> 01:12:54.100
of Dad and any other male.

01:12:54.100 --> 01:12:56.780
It's not instinctual,
in that case.

01:12:56.780 --> 01:13:01.400
Newborn humans are doing some
version of proximity to mom,

01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:03.430
vaginal fluid smell-- whatever.

01:13:03.430 --> 01:13:05.390
This seems to be bringing
up a question of,

01:13:05.390 --> 01:13:09.740
is there a difference in
bonding in those early stages

01:13:09.740 --> 01:13:13.325
between vaginal-birth
offspring and cesareans?

01:13:13.325 --> 01:13:15.700
I don't know, but that suggests
that should be happening.

01:13:15.700 --> 01:13:17.970
And maybe I should
even find that out.

01:13:17.970 --> 01:13:18.860
OK.

01:13:18.860 --> 01:13:20.090
Other features of it.

01:13:20.090 --> 01:13:23.710
Newborn kids, as we already
know from a couple lectures ago,

01:13:23.710 --> 01:13:25.960
can recognize the voice of Mom.

01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:26.620
How?

01:13:26.620 --> 01:13:29.950
From all that resonance, there,
inside the amniotic fluid,

01:13:29.950 --> 01:13:31.950
as Mom reads them War and Peace.

01:13:31.950 --> 01:13:33.800
And, as we also
heard, they can't

01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:35.760
recognize the voice of Dad.

01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:37.160
Not instinctual.

01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:39.210
In this case,
getting information

01:13:39.210 --> 01:13:42.840
on the sensory route--
the amniotic environment

01:13:42.840 --> 01:13:45.490
as a good resonator
for Mom's voice.

01:13:45.490 --> 01:13:47.680
So we're now already
getting a mixture, here,

01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:50.680
of some instinctual
olfactory stuff,

01:13:50.680 --> 01:13:54.690
major-histocompatibility-complex
stuff, some acquired,

01:13:54.690 --> 01:13:57.170
hardwired sensory-driven stuff.

01:13:57.170 --> 01:13:59.920
Ooh, does this sound like the
person whose voice I heard

01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:01.310
for those last nine months?

01:14:01.310 --> 01:14:04.500
And then some cognitive
stuff-- trying to figure out

01:14:04.500 --> 01:14:05.970
who this relative is.

01:14:05.970 --> 01:14:09.050
Ooh, who did they come
with to the party with?

01:14:09.050 --> 01:14:10.830
All of that-- the
cognitive stuff.

01:14:10.830 --> 01:14:12.970
So, already a suggestion
that we're not just

01:14:12.970 --> 01:14:15.510
such pure cognitive machines.

01:14:15.510 --> 01:14:17.510
So where is that
most interesting?

01:14:17.510 --> 01:14:20.480
And this is in a totally
fascinating series

01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:22.520
of studies that were
done over the years,

01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:26.360
showing just how little
conscious cognition might

01:14:26.360 --> 01:14:29.570
play out in us humans in
some really critical realms.

01:14:29.570 --> 01:14:34.330
Which is, who you decide you
are interested in mating with.

01:14:34.330 --> 01:14:37.040
OK, so how does
that work in humans?

01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:38.364
All sorts of different ways.

01:14:38.364 --> 01:14:40.780
But here's one way in which
it does something interesting.

01:14:40.780 --> 01:14:44.530
And this was a classic study
done by an anthropologist named

01:14:44.530 --> 01:14:45.730
Joseph Schaeffer.

01:14:45.730 --> 01:14:46.940
And this is what he did.

01:14:46.940 --> 01:14:50.960
He studied people who grew
up in Israel on kibbutzes.

01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:53.780
Kibbutzes-- these are these
traditional, socialist sort

01:14:53.780 --> 01:14:56.220
of communes, where one
of the-- none of them

01:14:56.220 --> 01:14:57.270
are like this anymore.

01:14:57.270 --> 01:14:59.832
But one of the early
principles was, one parent

01:14:59.832 --> 01:15:01.040
is as good as another parent.

01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:04.000
All the kids are raised in
these big, communal bathtubs

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:04.530
together.

01:15:04.530 --> 01:15:07.570
And it's one big, sort
of socialist [INAUDIBLE]

01:15:07.570 --> 01:15:09.640
of everybody bathing
naked together.

01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:13.470
And what Schaeffer found was
this very interesting thing.

01:15:13.470 --> 01:15:16.360
Which is, you are brought
up in your age group.

01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:18.660
All the kids born
this year are raised

01:15:18.660 --> 01:15:20.060
in the same communal group.

01:15:20.060 --> 01:15:21.672
And they take their
baths together,

01:15:21.672 --> 01:15:23.130
and they play
together, and they've

01:15:23.130 --> 01:15:25.720
got the same-- one
parent takes all of them

01:15:25.720 --> 01:15:27.630
for one afternoon,
every Tuesday afternoon,

01:15:27.630 --> 01:15:29.857
and the next one comes
for the next shift.

01:15:29.857 --> 01:15:31.440
And this big communal
business, there.

01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:33.790
And what Schaeffer
discovered was,

01:15:33.790 --> 01:15:37.850
if you were raised in the
same age group as somebody,

01:15:37.850 --> 01:15:41.080
anywhere up to six
years of age, you never,

01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:43.780
ever wind up marrying them.

01:15:43.780 --> 01:15:47.160
And this was not with a sample--
an appropriate sampling.

01:15:47.160 --> 01:15:50.740
This was a study he did of every
individual who ever grew up

01:15:50.740 --> 01:15:52.620
in the kibbutz system in Israel.

01:15:52.620 --> 01:15:55.620
We appear to have
a rule as follows.

01:15:55.620 --> 01:15:58.620
If this is somebody who you
spent a whole lot of time

01:15:58.620 --> 01:16:01.240
with before six
years of age, this

01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:03.250
is someone who you
sure don't want

01:16:03.250 --> 01:16:04.930
to grow up and marry-- yuck!

01:16:04.930 --> 01:16:06.430
And you love them--
they're incred--

01:16:06.430 --> 01:16:09.030
but they feel like my sister.

01:16:09.030 --> 01:16:10.680
They feel like my brother.

01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:12.810
Whoa, that would be
totally grotesque!

01:16:12.810 --> 01:16:15.230
There has never been a
case of people brought

01:16:15.230 --> 01:16:18.070
up during the first-- grow up
in your first six years of life,

01:16:18.070 --> 01:16:20.190
taking a whole lot of
baths with someone,

01:16:20.190 --> 01:16:22.670
and you are not going to
discover an amorous passion

01:16:22.670 --> 01:16:24.340
for them when
you're 20 years old.

01:16:24.340 --> 01:16:26.580
They're going to feel
like a sibling for you,

01:16:26.580 --> 01:16:28.280
for the rest of your life.

01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:29.450
What is that telling us?

01:16:29.450 --> 01:16:33.315
We have a very noncognitive
strategy in there.

01:16:33.315 --> 01:16:35.440
Yes, who are relatives--
who are appropriate people

01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:36.250
to mate with?

01:16:36.250 --> 01:16:39.280
Well, if we know that this is
the daughter of Mom's sister,

01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:40.860
then this person
is not appropriate,

01:16:40.860 --> 01:16:43.520
and this whole cognitive--
spend a whole lot of time

01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:46.620
naked with somebody, taking
baths and playing pattycake

01:16:46.620 --> 01:16:49.380
and counting their toes,
the first six years of life,

01:16:49.380 --> 01:16:51.050
they feel like a sibling.

01:16:51.050 --> 01:16:54.120
Something very similar was
then shown by Arthur Wolf,

01:16:54.120 --> 01:16:56.430
here, in the
Anthropology department--

01:16:56.430 --> 01:16:57.860
a different cultural version.

01:16:57.860 --> 01:17:00.300
Traditional Taiwanese
marriages, where

01:17:00.300 --> 01:17:04.140
there's some equivalent of that,
and where either you wind up

01:17:04.140 --> 01:17:07.610
with your future spouse
at some insanely early age

01:17:07.610 --> 01:17:10.410
and basically get brought
up with them from infancy,

01:17:10.410 --> 01:17:11.740
or it happens later.

01:17:11.740 --> 01:17:14.230
And if you're brought up
from infancy with them,

01:17:14.230 --> 01:17:16.360
you have a disastrous
marriage later on,

01:17:16.360 --> 01:17:19.280
because they feel like a sibling
for the rest of your life.

01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:21.920
So what this shows
us here is, yes, we

01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:25.340
are these wonderful,
rational, cognitive machines.

01:17:25.340 --> 01:17:28.330
We've got all sorts
of innate strategies

01:17:28.330 --> 01:17:31.840
and sensory-imprinting stuff
going on, instead, in us.

01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:34.790
We are not a whole lot
fancier than hamsters.

01:17:34.790 --> 01:17:36.720
What does this set us up for?

01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:39.160
A topic that's going to
be real important when

01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:43.260
we come to the lectures on
aggression and cooperation

01:17:43.260 --> 01:17:45.390
and competition and all of that.

01:17:45.390 --> 01:17:49.040
Which is, if we spend a lot
of our time figuring out

01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:52.690
who we are related
to-- cognitively--

01:17:52.690 --> 01:17:54.880
or, even more
importantly, if we are

01:17:54.880 --> 01:17:57.880
malleable in the way these
kids growing up in Taiwan,

01:17:57.880 --> 01:17:59.540
or in these
kibbutzes-- if we are

01:17:59.540 --> 01:18:03.440
malleable in who
we feel related to,

01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:06.890
it is possible to manipulate
us in lots of ways

01:18:06.890 --> 01:18:09.190
to feel more related
to individuals

01:18:09.190 --> 01:18:13.130
than we actually are, or to feel
less related to individuals.

01:18:13.130 --> 01:18:16.390
And the terms for these
are "pseudo kinship"

01:18:16.390 --> 01:18:18.280
and "pseudo speciation."

01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:20.010
And what we will
eventually see is,

01:18:20.010 --> 01:18:23.620
when you make sense of human
violence and human cooperation

01:18:23.620 --> 01:18:25.650
and human aggression
and all of that,

01:18:25.650 --> 01:18:29.970
we are so easily manipulated
as to who counts as an "us"

01:18:29.970 --> 01:18:31.630
and who counts as a "them."

01:18:31.630 --> 01:18:35.250
And one of the brilliant things
militaries all the world over

01:18:35.250 --> 01:18:38.940
do, whether you're talking
about clans with warrior classes

01:18:38.940 --> 01:18:41.660
all the way up to sort
of state militaries--

01:18:41.660 --> 01:18:45.210
what you see in all these cases
is a brilliant understanding

01:18:45.210 --> 01:18:48.720
of how to make nonrelatives feel
like they're a band of brothers

01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:51.560
and how to make "them" seem
so different they hardly

01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:52.970
even count as humans.

01:18:52.970 --> 01:18:55.870
So this ability for
us to be manipulated

01:18:55.870 --> 01:18:59.560
in these subliminal ways, as
to who counts as a relative,

01:18:59.560 --> 01:19:01.850
will come back to
haunt us big-time

01:19:01.850 --> 01:19:04.920
in making sense of a lot
of human social behavior.

01:19:04.920 --> 01:19:08.060
In other words, we are
not purely rational.

01:19:08.060 --> 01:19:08.690
OK.

01:19:08.690 --> 01:19:11.520
So what we will do on Monday
is switch another bucket, now,

01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:14.540
to this field of ethology,
which, once again, is trying

01:19:14.540 --> 01:19:17.399
to make sense of, what
behaviors are hardwired,

01:19:17.399 --> 01:19:18.440
what does environment do?

01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:21.750
You will see a completely
different approach--

01:19:21.750 --> 01:19:25.010
