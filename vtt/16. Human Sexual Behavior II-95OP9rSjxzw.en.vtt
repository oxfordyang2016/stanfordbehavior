00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:05.860
Stanford University.

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.084
Let us get started here.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.680
So picking up from the other
day, where have we gotten?

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.020
Not very far.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.860
Behavior-- full
range variability

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.450
of sexual behaviors,
fixed action patterns.

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:27.730
Is this kind of dark here?

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.350
No.

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:32.460
Seeing in some ways
what's interesting

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.910
is the conservative nature of
sexual behavior across species,

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.130
other ways the sheer
variety, trying

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.850
to make sense of what aspects
of human behavior are unique,

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:43.630
all of that.

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:46.300
Then beginning to march
backwards-- what goes on

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.780
in the nervous system one second
before sexual behavior occurs?

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.850
And marching through the
relevant limbic structures,

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.900
some of which have
strong sex differences,

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.520
some of which don't.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.590
Seeing some ways in
which neurotransmitters

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.980
in the whole world of dopamine
complicates things enormously,

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:07.820
marching through there.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.220
Where we had then gotten
to was asking, OK, so

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.270
what sort of bits of information
in the environment, what

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.570
sort of ethological
releasing stimuli

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.210
can trigger the nervous
system to do its thing?

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:21.860
And you've got the drill by now.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.540
So what we had done
was look at a couple

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.890
of different sensory
systems, and we had just

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.900
started to wallow in
the world of pheromones,

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.900
of pheromonal communication.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.630
What we ended with was number
one, the hormone dependency

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.440
of generating sexually
meaningful pheromones,

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.860
that business being
that males have to have

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.110
sufficient testosterone.

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.430
Females have to have
ovaries on board

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.190
to be producing pheromones
that carry sexual meaning.

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.110
What is the reason for that?

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.950
The fact that a whole lot
of the actual chemicals that

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.540
constitute sexually meaningful
pheromones are made out

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.280
of some sex hormone
breakdown products

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.900
and the sheer bizarrity but
eventual wonderful clarity

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.340
of what's up with perfumes.

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.509
Then transitioning
at the very end

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.640
to the business about how your
endocrine status has a lot

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.820
to do with your perception of
pheromones from the other sex,

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.840
that women who are
ovariectomized to low estrogen

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.330
levels have trouble being
able to differentiate

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.780
the smell of males and
females, men and women.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.230
And estrogen replacement
takes care of that.

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.150
The exact same thing when you
take away testosterone for men,

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.810
and what we were just about to
get to before we had to stop

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.180
was one additional
thing, which is

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.610
one's opinion about
the pheromones

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.130
that you were smelling.

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.830
And this goes back
to a literature,

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.180
a really interesting
one showing that

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.440
not only are women
better at differentiating

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.260
between the smell
of men and women--

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.790
gonadally intact men and women.

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.310
Not only are they
better at doing

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.460
that around the
point of ovulation,

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.950
but their preference
for the smell of males

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.020
gets more dramatic around
the time of ovulation.

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.490
Meanwhile, over at the
male end of things,

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:14.340
something rather
similar in terms of what

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.610
you make of the pheromones.

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:21.210
And this was a famous classic
study in which women volunteers

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:23.840
had their armpits swabbed
at different points

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.730
in their menstrual cycle and
put into little sealed jars,

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.530
and all sorts of male
volunteers sniffing them

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.880
and rating their pleasantness.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.420
And what you found
was on the average,

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.220
the odorants were rated in
the unpleasant direction,

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.270
but they were rated as least
unpleasant around the time

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:44.750
that women are ovulating.

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.960
And I think once we get
past the world of armpit

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:51.060
smells in little
glass jars, one can

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.460
get into the more ethologically
relevant world of men prefer

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:57.840
pheromones derived from
women around the time

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.290
when women are ovulating.

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.450
Once again, a
testosterone-dependent

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.030
phenomenon.

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.520
What we now begin
to look at are some

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:10.560
of the physiological effects of
sexual pheromones between sexes

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.740
within sexes.

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:14.790
One example you heard about
in the very first lecture,

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.730
which is that whole business,
that Wellesley effect

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:20.680
the ability of females of all
sorts of different species,

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.180
including college
freshman human females,

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.980
to synchronize each
other's cycles,

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:29.770
this being done with pheromones,
intersexual perception

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.040
of pheromones, so
the Wellesley effect.

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.220
What's also shown in a
number of rodent species

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.020
is the pheromones, the
smell of an adult female,

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:44.380
will delay the onset of
puberty of younger females.

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.220
And how might one frame that?

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.960
That is utterly a gene
competition sort of strategy

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:50.510
there.

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:52.740
This is reproductive
competition.

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.890
If you arrest the development
of the other females around you,

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:00.290
you are going to leave
more copies, et cetera.

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:03.290
Meanwhile, a
literature of intramale

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:05.730
physiological
effects-- what happens

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:08.360
to the physiology of
males in various species

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.340
when smelling the
pheromones of other males?

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.670
What you see, first
off, is it depends

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:17.470
on who the other guy you're
smelling, the dominance rank.

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:21.050
In lots of rodent species and
some primate species as well,

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.860
males are able to
differentiate between smells

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.416
of very high ranking males
and very low ranking ones,

00:05:26.416 --> 00:05:27.290
and what do you know?

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:29.750
They're not all that upset
about the low ranking ones.

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.020
What do you see in terms of
the physiological effects

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:34.900
in the number of
species when males

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.610
are smelling the pheromones
of big, healthy, strapping,

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.420
androgenic other males?

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:44.310
In some cases, it drives down
their testosterone levels.

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:47.660
They're totally
physiologically intimidated,

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:50.440
this being some great
competitive strategy

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:52.650
for males who could pump
out just the right kind

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:54.300
of suppressive pheromones.

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.430
In other species,
though, what you

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:59.610
see is a sudden burst
of sperm production,

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:01.140
and what's that about?

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:03.410
Another version of
the same logic-- this

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:05.240
is a counter-strategy.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:09.160
If males have come up, evolved
the means in various rodent

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:13.390
species to generate pheromones
that will drive down

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:16.370
testosterone levels in
opponents, what males also

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:19.770
want to have evolve with some
mechanism of when smelling

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:22.370
those sorts of pheromones
to try to counter that

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:25.740
by increasing sperm production.

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:30.030
What we have here is a
co-evolutionary arms race.

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:34.549
Terms of interactions of
pheromones between the sexes,

00:06:34.549 --> 00:06:36.340
and what I've been
doing here is describing

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:38.530
all this without
making use of this,

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:40.910
so what you see
is physiologically

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:43.740
when the female is
the pheromone donor,

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:46.580
and the other recipient is
a female in terms of, say,

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:49.960
puberty, decreasing
puberty onset,

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:53.420
and what we just saw with
male is donor versus male

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:56.830
is in some ways suppressing
some endpoint's testosterone,

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:59.820
in some ways increasing
sperm production.

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:02.220
What you see in lots
of rodent species,

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:05.990
when you're looking at
between genders, when males

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:08.660
are the source of
pheromones among rodents,

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:14.030
it accelerates puberty
onset in the females.

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:17.360
And when you've got
females as the donors,

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:21.090
it increases testosterone
level and sperm production

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:23.550
in the males of lots
of different species.

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:26.160
So all this makes
wonderful, wonderful, sort

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:29.560
of sociobiological sense in
terms of how this should work.

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:31.910
Elaborations on this, of course.

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:35.240
What you also see is
not only puberty onset

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:36.580
and being regulated.

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:38.970
You also see in all
sorts of species

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:43.780
where you can induce
ovulation by sensory stimuli.

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:47.770
What you see is the
smell of a female

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:52.030
will decrease the likelihood
of induced ovulation.

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:55.200
Female-- the smell of
a male will increase

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:56.490
the likelihood of ovulation.

00:07:56.490 --> 00:07:58.890
All sorts of species
that do not have

00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:02.250
automatic rhythms of
ovulation cycles of that way,

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:04.060
but rather they are induced.

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:07.510
And one classic example
of that are pigs.

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:10.760
Pigs are inducible ovulators,
if you've always wondered

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:12.330
whether that's the case or not.

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:15.820
And you can go and
recreationally buy

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:18.140
a variant of pig pheromone.

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:20.900
This is known as Boar
Mate, and no doubt,

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:23.076
that's not only patent
pended, but somewhere out

00:08:23.076 --> 00:08:24.450
in the Midwest,
there's all sorts

00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:27.010
of TV jingles about Boar Mate.

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:34.370
And Boar Mate is an ovulation
inducer in female boars

00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:37.929
and involving a same
male-derived pheromone,

00:08:37.929 --> 00:08:41.350
which are found in truffles,
truffles which somehow

00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:45.480
have stumbled on the means to
induce female pigs to ovulate.

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:49.060
And no doubt, that's explaining
some very interesting

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:53.330
interspecies interactions,
so that being another realm.

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:56.020
Inducible all
physiological changes--

00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:59.160
in this case, one classic
demonstration of it.

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:02.650
In this case,
probably pheromones

00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:06.690
of female causing an indirect
measure of testosterone levels

00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:07.540
in a male.

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:10.030
This is a classic
paper, and you will

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:12.600
note that I didn't
say females and males.

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:14.660
Saying a female and a male.

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:18.370
This was a classic paper in
nature some 30 years ago or so,

00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:22.030
which was written by the very
famous and well-known doctor

00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:23.200
Anonymous.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:26.040
The author's name was
not published there.

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:30.050
And this was a researcher
who did research

00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:33.830
in an unspecified hemisphere
with an unspecified species,

00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:37.410
but involved long stretches of
being at a research facility

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:40.480
completely on his own in
isolation from other humans,

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:42.820
and all sorts of people in
the business for decades

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:45.310
afterward have been speculating
on who the author is.

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:47.660
And it's generally understood.

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:50.610
And what this person noted
was every now and then,

00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:53.550
he would pick up and
go to the city that

00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:56.970
was a three-hour
seaplane flight away

00:09:56.970 --> 00:09:59.200
or some such thing,
where among other things,

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:03.040
he had a highly significant
other with a great deal

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:06.336
of physical intimacy
and all that stuff

00:10:06.336 --> 00:10:08.400
from kind of the right
side of the chart.

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:11.110
And what he noticed
was what he perceived

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:13.650
to be an extraordinary
difference in what he

00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:18.940
was subjectively interpreting
as testosterone-driven mood

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:22.550
and level of energy and all of
that depending on where he was.

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:24.930
Not quite being the
type of field ethologist

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:27.350
that took blood from
himself, what he did instead

00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:30.590
was take an indirect assay
building on the well-known fact

00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:32.140
that testosterone
has something to do

00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:34.760
with the rate of beard growth.

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:37.610
And what he wound up
doing was very soon,

00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:40.680
having a razor there
every day, shaving,

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:43.990
and getting the little bits
of stubble, and weighing it.

00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:47.000
Weighing it is an indirect
assay of testosterone levels,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.330
and what was shown was
sit out there by himself

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:52.365
with whatever ungulates
he was obsessing over,

00:10:52.365 --> 00:10:53.990
and this sort of rate
of beard growth--

00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:57.270
go back to the rest of the
world, and it does this.

00:10:57.270 --> 00:10:59.760
And this square wave
going on like that,

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:03.810
this as a very-- and OK, what
are all the confounds here?

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:05.620
It's not clear if
it was pheromones.

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:07.490
Maybe it was actually
being in proximity

00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:09.770
to the newspaper
in the town that he

00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:11.240
returned to now and then.

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:12.950
Maybe there was a
confound of whatever

00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:15.690
aftershave he was using
that was doing something

00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:16.700
rather to his testes.

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:18.660
Nonetheless,
generally interpreted

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:21.510
as this being a really
interesting, indirect,

00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:24.920
and equal-- was one
example of induction

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:27.880
of physiological
changes in human males

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:30.600
by pheromones from females.

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:33.450
So if you ever meet Dr.
Anonymous, who interestingly,

00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:35.850
has been publishing
papers for about 300 years

00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:39.310
or so every now and then,
congratulate that individual

00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:41.280
on the research.

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:44.600
So pheromonal stuff--
now elaborations of it,

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:47.230
which you should be able
to derive all on your own

00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:49.710
from some of our
principles by now, which

00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:54.780
is, what if for example,
you are a female donor

00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:57.200
and female recipient,
and the whole logic

00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:00.720
here being decrease the
likelihood of ovulation?

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.620
Delay the onset of puberty.

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:06.490
What if these are siblings,
if these are two sisters?

00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:08.670
And you were off and
running with that one.

00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:10.830
It will not work as effectively.

00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:12.940
Easy kin selection argument.

00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:15.450
So all sorts of
aspects of relatedness,

00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:18.160
you will not have your
testosterone levels driven up

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:21.520
if you are a hamster, and you
were smelling your sister,

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:25.870
all that sort of thing that
makes perfect sense by now.

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:30.350
Now switching over-- one last
piece of business, though.

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:33.590
In terms of the pheromonal
attractiveness stuff,

00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:38.150
a handful of studies showing
that among homosexual men, what

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:42.770
you have is it's the smell of
men who are preferred to women,

00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:45.020
and it's when men have
higher testosterone

00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:48.500
levels that they are preferred.

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:52.670
And what we've got there
is an exact same physiology

00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:56.300
in a somewhat going in the
opposite direction, flipping

00:12:56.300 --> 00:13:00.230
of things that sure argues for
some interesting biological

00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:01.220
underpinnings.

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:07.800
One final thing-- women not only
prefer the smell of men when

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:09.880
around the time that
they are ovulating.

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:13.420
Their noses selectively
become more sensitive to such

00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:17.560
smells, and estrogen has
all sorts of receptors

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:19.900
on olfactory neurons.

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:21.680
So that makes sense.

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:24.370
Leaping over to other
sensory systems--

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:26.650
gustatory stimuli--
this is not one

00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:29.200
of the more exciting outposts,
unless you are something

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:32.360
like a giraffe, in which case
you take part in what is called

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:37.990
flehmening, a good old Germanic
ethological term, which is you

00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:40.730
want all sorts of interesting
reproductive information

00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:43.170
on somebody else,
and you just don't

00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:45.700
have the time to sniff
the air for pheromones.

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:48.580
So what you do is you go over
and lick the individual's

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:51.740
private parts, and suddenly,
you know oh so much

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:53.310
about their personal lives.

00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:56.160
In this case, gustatory
information being passed.

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.130
We've already heard
about examples

00:13:58.130 --> 00:14:02.050
of auditory priming,
inducible ovulation

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:06.990
in various moose-like species
in the wilds of Minnesota,

00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:10.670
where what the stags have
these roaring fixed action

00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:15.840
patterns, which will induce all
sorts of ovulatory responses

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:17.530
in females around.

00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:19.270
So this is another domain.

00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:21.440
Remember also that
interesting factoid

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:23.560
when this was
mentioned previously

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:26.460
that in human
females, voices get

00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:29.690
a little bit higher around
the time of ovulation

00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:31.530
and in a way that is detectable.

00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:34.810
Something important in terms
of all this pheromonal stuff

00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:36.870
in humans, what
has been shown over

00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:41.650
and over and over again is these
are all subliminal processes as

00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:45.680
in the humans are not
consciously aware of wow,

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:49.580
this one smells more like my
gonadally intact second cousin

00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:53.250
who was adopted away to Bolivia
for awhile when I was a kid.

00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:55.880
There is not the consciousness,
but nonetheless, you

00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:57.830
force people to
make these choices,

00:14:57.830 --> 00:15:00.840
and implicitly, you get
insight into these same sort

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:02.560
of influences.

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:06.920
But, of course, by the
time you get to humans,

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:09.880
and you talk about sensory
releasers and all of that,

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:14.080
you get, of course, the point
endlessly emphasized by Cosmo

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:17.820
and God knows where else that
ultimately, the most erogenous

00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:21.570
organ in humans is the
brain, thought as a releaser,

00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:24.910
thought as a more powerful
humans are not a particularly

00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:26.560
olfactory species.

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:29.110
We are not a particularly
great auditory one,

00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:30.410
et cetera, et cetera.

00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:33.780
An awful lot of these
sexual priming in humans

00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:36.840
coming by way of
thought bypassing

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:39.670
this whole ethological world.

00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:43.600
More environmental factors,
acute environmental factors

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:46.840
that can affect all of
this, and what you've got

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:49.350
is a very reliable
way to drive down

00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:52.100
libido is to make an
organism terrified.

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:56.180
Fear as suppressive of
reproductive behavior.

00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:59.840
What you also have is
extreme rage doing the same.

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:02.810
Stress in general--
stress is interesting,

00:16:02.810 --> 00:16:05.380
because what you get is
a dichotomous outcome,

00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:07.040
chronic stress.

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:09.550
So now we're not talking
about an acute stressor,

00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:11.460
but all the way
back, chronic stress

00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:15.190
is extremely suppressive
of reproductive physiology

00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:17.290
and behavior, which
you will be finding out

00:16:17.290 --> 00:16:20.010
when you read the relevant
chapter in the zebra's book.

00:16:20.010 --> 00:16:23.820
But what you see as short term,
there's a lot more variability,

00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:25.740
particularly among males.

00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:28.550
What you see is a
lot of variability

00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:34.210
as to whether short term stress
stimulates arousal or inhibits

00:16:34.210 --> 00:16:34.960
it.

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:37.360
And people have
pointed out all sorts

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:40.010
of horrific bits
of evidence showing

00:16:40.010 --> 00:16:43.120
in circumstances of
extreme arousal and stress,

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:47.250
say, during warfare, where
that produces all sorts

00:16:47.250 --> 00:16:50.040
of violent sexual behavior.

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:53.400
No shortage of horrible
historical precedents

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:54.550
for those.

00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:57.320
So a difference between
chronic stress versus acute

00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:59.860
stress-- more
effects around here.

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:05.440
One final interesting bit of
releasing stimulus, stimuli,

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:08.359
whatever a bit of a
stimulus is, and one

00:17:08.359 --> 00:17:10.930
that transcends a
particular sensory system

00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:13.619
is something called
the Coolidge effect.

00:17:13.619 --> 00:17:15.819
And the Coolidge effect
probably accounts

00:17:15.819 --> 00:17:19.359
for like 49% of the
misery encapsulated

00:17:19.359 --> 00:17:22.130
in human literature and
movies and all of that.

00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:24.800
What is the Coolidge
effect in species

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:26.609
after species after species?

00:17:26.609 --> 00:17:30.070
You take an individual,
who is sexually sated,

00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:32.270
which is to say that,
for example, you've

00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:35.160
got some male rodent who's been
mating with the female rodent

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:38.630
there, and has gotten to the
point where he has had enough,

00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:41.270
enough on some
physiological level

00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:44.760
or some deeply emotional
what matters to me in my life

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:46.300
rodential sort of level.

00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:48.830
But in any case,
the male is sated,

00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:51.430
has stopped having
sex with a female.

00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:53.190
And what the Coolidge
effect is about

00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:56.950
is he put in a different
female, and things

00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:58.610
start all over again.

00:17:58.610 --> 00:18:03.444
Variety as wildly stimulating
of sexual arousal,

00:18:03.444 --> 00:18:07.220
and the Coolidge effect sure
works in humans and accounts

00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:08.580
for all sorts of misery.

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:10.460
Coolidge, by the way,
was not the scientist

00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:12.530
who first described
it, but Coolidge

00:18:12.530 --> 00:18:15.730
refers to Calvin Coolidge,
and as far as I know,

00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:18.020
this is the only
anecdote ever to occur

00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:20.760
about the guy, something
where he and his wife

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:23.000
were being shown
some chicken farm,

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.090
and there were
breeding roosters.

00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:30.740
And when they would get sick
of breeding with this pen,

00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:32.120
they would stick a new one in.

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:35.610
And Mrs. Coolidge made
some sarcastic remark,

00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:38.210
and he made one back,
and before you knew it,

00:18:38.210 --> 00:18:39.630
it was the Great Depression.

00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:43.600
So I actually have no
memory of what they said,

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:46.020
but in terms of
wittiness, you get

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:48.890
what you can when you
have Calvin Coolidge, so.

00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:49.470
OK.

00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:50.970
We hurtle on.

00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:54.770
We hurtle on here, now beginning
to look at an entire missing

00:18:54.770 --> 00:18:56.650
category here in my rush.

00:18:56.650 --> 00:18:58.960
Now we have what's
going on with hormones,

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:01.160
longer term hormonal stuff?

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:04.790
Not the hormone levels
that you have influenced

00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:09.100
as a result of sexual behavior,
not the hormone levels just

00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:11.880
right around the time
of all this neurobiology

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:16.100
happening, but now beginning
to talk about hormone levels

00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:20.360
like over the last 28
days or so in a female.

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:22.670
And what one
immediately barrels into

00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:27.080
is this issue of how much
is sexual behavior in women

00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:30.310
a function of where
you are in your cycle?

00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:32.030
What's the reason
even to suspect

00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:36.740
that the entire world of other
species that will have females

00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:39.430
coming into estrus,
coming into heat,

00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:41.650
having elevated
estrogen levels only

00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:45.390
at very demarcated times of
the year, and what you see

00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:48.690
is in lots of species,
a large number of them,

00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:52.870
in fact-- what you see is you
only get reproductive behavior,

00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:56.430
you only get sexual behavior
in females around the time

00:19:56.430 --> 00:19:57.820
that they are ovulating.

00:19:57.820 --> 00:20:02.900
You only get active female
proceptive seeking of sex

00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:04.530
around those times.

00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:06.930
By the time you get
to non-human primates,

00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:09.610
it depends on the species
you're looking at.

00:20:09.610 --> 00:20:13.040
But in general, it's not quite
as tight of a relationship.

00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:19.230
So if you had some
rodent across a year,

00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:21.500
this was all the
points of ovulation.

00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:24.120
Your pattern of sexual
behavior of a female

00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:25.990
would look like this.

00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:28.530
Likelihood of mating
with a male by the time

00:20:28.530 --> 00:20:31.580
you get to non-human
primates in most species,

00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:32.730
it looks more like that.

00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:35.970
It's not quite as dramatic, and
thus, of course, the question

00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:39.950
becomes, where do
humans fit in on this?

00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:44.040
And a classic study, extremely
influential in the early '70s

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:48.290
was the first to look at this,
which was females, humans,

00:20:48.290 --> 00:20:51.570
women reporting their
levels of sexual activity,

00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:54.110
as well as the
likelihood of orgasm

00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:58.740
per sexual bout, if
that's the right word,

00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:01.440
and where they
were in the cycle.

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:03.220
So this is what you
wound up seeing,

00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:07.680
and this by any measure,
likelihood of having sex,

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:10.660
whatever, the curve looked
something like this.

00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:19.290
And what they reported
was a big increase

00:21:19.290 --> 00:21:24.170
around the time of day 14 and
a secondary increase around day

00:21:24.170 --> 00:21:25.140
28.

00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:26.590
Not as large of
one, and when you

00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:28.610
looked at the
likelihood of orgasm,

00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:31.470
it was basically doing
the same exact thing.

00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:35.930
Day 14-- that's just a somewhat
less restricted version

00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:37.620
of the exact same phenomenon.

00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:40.650
Never down to zero,
but nonetheless,

00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:43.700
this is another version of
this exact same phenomenon--

00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:48.360
libido sexual proceptivity
increasing in women,

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:51.840
in human females around
the time of ovulation.

00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:56.510
But no other species shows
this one going on here, so

00:21:56.510 --> 00:21:57.480
what's up with that?

00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:00.070
Any speculation why you
have the secondary increase

00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:00.986
around day 28?

00:22:06.610 --> 00:22:07.110
Come on.

00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:11.830
Somebody's got to--
yes, you're right.

00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:13.420
That's exactly what they found.

00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:15.570
That's exactly what they
found, and good for you

00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:17.500
feeling comfortable
speaking up in class

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:18.800
all in unison like that.

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:19.300
OK.

00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:23.140
What that tends to be
is that women are more

00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:26.270
relaxed about fear of
pregnancy around the time

00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:30.010
of their period, and, thus,
sexual behavior increases

00:22:30.010 --> 00:22:31.430
somewhat around that point.

00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:34.200
But the thing that everybody
most importantly came away with

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:37.900
was just like every
other mammal out there

00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:41.470
that has regular cycling
or only seasonal ones,

00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:45.360
high estrogen is when you
get the most sexual behavior.

00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:48.200
Instead of high estrogen
is the only time

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:49.650
you get sexual behavior.

00:22:49.650 --> 00:22:52.510
Instead, you simply get
the most around then.

00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:54.830
In the years since,
lots of people

00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:57.000
have done versions
on this study,

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.390
and it is frequently difficult
to replicate this phenomenon

00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:04.820
in terms of a change in
levels of sexual activity

00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:07.510
in women around the
time of ovulation.

00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:09.900
What has remained very
clear in the literature

00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:13.770
though is that sexual arousal
increases around the time

00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:15.030
of ovulation in women.

00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:18.250
Very reliable effect.

00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:21.830
And what that is
interpreted as is behavior

00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:23.940
here may not be
telling you anywhere

00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:28.450
near as much as motivation,
arousal, proceptivity

00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:31.150
at that time, and that's
a more pure measure

00:23:31.150 --> 00:23:33.100
of what's going on
physiologically there

00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:34.940
or what's going
on in the brains.

00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:38.520
Fitting with that is a
very interesting literature

00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:41.830
suggesting that women act
a little bit differently

00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:44.520
in terms of proceptive
sexual signaling

00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:46.460
around the time of ovulation.

00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:51.070
Studies showing, for example,
that women as assessed

00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:54.210
by both women and men,
women on the average

00:23:54.210 --> 00:23:56.980
wear more provocative
clothing around the time

00:23:56.980 --> 00:23:58.440
that they are ovulating.

00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:01.710
Yes, people would go and study
things like this for a living.

00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:06.750
These were not big effects,
but the all-time bizarre study

00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:08.410
I've ever heard
of in this domain

00:24:08.410 --> 00:24:11.330
was actually published with
a straight face by this guy,

00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:14.380
and he's an evolutionary
psychologist, University

00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:16.720
of New Mexico, a guy
named Jeffrey Miller, who

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:18.240
reported the following.

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:21.150
And you know what he
was spending his time

00:24:21.150 --> 00:24:23.990
doing, which he
reported was that

00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:29.015
around the time of ovulation,
lap dancers get larger tips.

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:34.740
OK.

00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:39.960
That has since been
replicated in E. coli

00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:44.710
and in various yeast
species, and you know,

00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:47.840
I'm not going to try to unpack
that one in any sort of way.

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:50.110
But nonetheless,
this was reported

00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:53.260
and shows you just how wonderful
it could be to be a scientist.

00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:55.820
Can you imagine
that money was being

00:24:55.820 --> 00:24:58.190
spent on that-- your
research dollars-- instead

00:24:58.190 --> 00:25:02.240
of strafing people in Kandahar
province or something?

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:05.360
So we have a peak there,
this general issue

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:09.520
of what does hormonal
cyclicity, in a time scale

00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:10.680
of weeks to months.

00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:13.830
What does that do to sexual
behavior in various species?

00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:17.180
What does that do to sexual
arousal proceptivity?

00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:19.870
What are some of the
building blocks of that?

00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:22.430
Estrogen-- as
estrogen levels go up,

00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:25.370
estrogen increases
the expression

00:25:25.370 --> 00:25:29.250
of receptors for progesterone.

00:25:29.250 --> 00:25:32.510
So you can immediately
begin to piece that apart

00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:36.190
in at least two different
ways, first one being estrogen,

00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:39.130
thus increasing the
sensitivity in the brain.

00:25:39.130 --> 00:25:40.240
This is a brain effect.

00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:42.020
Sensitivity to
progesterone, which

00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:46.660
has something to do with the
rewarding aspects of sex.

00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:50.130
You can also translate that
into molecular biology.

00:25:50.130 --> 00:25:52.870
Estrogen, being a
steroid hormone,

00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:56.660
is going to bind to its receptor
and do the whole transcription

00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:58.920
factor, translocation
sort of thing,

00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:01.650
telling you that
upstream of the gene

00:26:01.650 --> 00:26:05.230
for the progesterone
receptor is a promoter that's

00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:08.370
responsive to estrogen
and estrogen receptors.

00:26:08.370 --> 00:26:11.030
You know how this
one works by now.

00:26:11.030 --> 00:26:14.340
More pieces of it--
estrogen when rising here,

00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:18.090
also increases the
synthesis of oxytocin.

00:26:18.090 --> 00:26:20.860
Back to all that
social bonding stuff,

00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:24.490
and what that suggests-- I don't
know if it has been studied,

00:26:24.490 --> 00:26:29.210
but that women will feel
more affiliative with someone

00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:32.170
they've had sex with if
around the time of ovulation

00:26:32.170 --> 00:26:33.260
than at other points.

00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:35.650
That is certainly
the case with a vole,

00:26:35.650 --> 00:26:38.360
but that is certainly
the case, because they

00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:42.830
don't mate the rest of the time,
and because male voles suddenly

00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:45.960
are expressive around there
in terms of their feelings.

00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:49.760
OK So more building
blocks of it.

00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:52.340
Estrogen is not only having
effects in the brain,

00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:54.470
but it's also having
effects throughout the body

00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:58.040
at those times in terms
of lowering the threshold

00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:00.730
of certain tactile receptors.

00:27:00.730 --> 00:27:02.070
What does that mean?

00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:04.010
That means around
the time that women

00:27:04.010 --> 00:27:06.610
are ovulating,
thanks to estrogen,

00:27:06.610 --> 00:27:08.830
they are more
sensitive to touch.

00:27:08.830 --> 00:27:12.380
And I'm sure this has been
studied in consenting hamsters,

00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:15.050
but my bet is that more
sensitive to tactile

00:27:15.050 --> 00:27:18.240
stimulation in some parts
of the body over others.

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:21.990
What estrogen also is
doing, as we just heard,

00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:23.715
is working on the
olfactory system

00:27:23.715 --> 00:27:27.800
and lowering thresholds for
detecting the smell of males.

00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:30.940
So we've got all sorts
of ways within the brain

00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:34.890
and in the periphery to
bias towards more arousal

00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:35.680
at that time.

00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:38.050
Wonderful evolutionary biology.

00:27:38.050 --> 00:27:39.630
No problem at all.

00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:42.110
One additional piece
of the female story,

00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:45.370
which is the effects over the
course of this kind of time

00:27:45.370 --> 00:27:48.890
span-- weeks to months to
years or so-- the effects

00:27:48.890 --> 00:27:52.180
of those androgens,
those male sex hormones

00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:53.960
that females are releasing.

00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:55.720
And what you see
there is that plays

00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:59.700
a role in proceptivity,
increasing sexual arousal,

00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:02.070
sexual motivation.

00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:05.610
Meanwhile, on the other side
of the road, we've got males,

00:28:05.610 --> 00:28:08.960
and what does testosterone--
testosterone over

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:11.280
this time span-- what
does it have to do

00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:13.830
with sexual behavior in males?

00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:16.860
Well, on first pass,
it sure looks like it

00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:19.170
has a lot to do with it.

00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:20.970
What sort of evidence?

00:28:20.970 --> 00:28:23.890
Initially, correlative evidence.

00:28:23.890 --> 00:28:28.410
Well, the time of year
in various species

00:28:28.410 --> 00:28:31.320
where males do their
mating is the time of year

00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:34.140
when testosterone
levels are elevated.

00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:36.790
Over the life span,
testosterone levels

00:28:36.790 --> 00:28:39.530
go up around puberty
and from about age

00:28:39.530 --> 00:28:44.040
30 on, very gently cascade
down into alarming senescence,

00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:47.170
and what you see there is
a similar profile in terms

00:28:47.170 --> 00:28:48.660
of sexual behavior.

00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:50.410
That does not tell us much.

00:28:50.410 --> 00:28:51.970
These are correlations.

00:28:51.970 --> 00:28:55.250
Furthermore, correlative
studies in humans, a handful,

00:28:55.250 --> 00:28:58.240
showing more sexually
active men tend

00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:00.400
to have higher
testosterone levels,

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:02.500
and for what it's worth,
a number of studies

00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:05.980
have documented a dramatic
drop in testosterone levels

00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:10.390
in men right around the time
that they become fathers.

00:29:10.390 --> 00:29:10.890
OK.

00:29:10.890 --> 00:29:12.110
So figure that one out.

00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:15.470
Also an increase in vasopressin
levels at that time.

00:29:15.470 --> 00:29:18.660
You know how to interpret
this one by now.

00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:21.880
So we've got testosterone
and higher levels

00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:25.040
of male sexual behavior
going hand in hand.

00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:28.000
Are we looking at
any causality here?

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.870
First off, we already know
about one piece of causality,

00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:35.980
which was the other day, sexual
behavior in men, in males,

00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:38.110
increases testosterone levels.

00:29:38.110 --> 00:29:41.080
So that's one reason why
they may go hand in hand.

00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:42.790
In that scenario,
testosterone has

00:29:42.790 --> 00:29:47.270
nothing to do with increasing
the likelihood of the behavior.

00:29:47.270 --> 00:29:49.320
So does testosterone
actually have

00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:52.700
a causal role in
increasing the likelihood

00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:54.660
of male sexual behavior?

00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:57.050
And the answer is yes.

00:29:57.050 --> 00:29:58.210
And how do you show it?

00:29:58.210 --> 00:30:00.950
With the most simple classic
way of doing something

00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:03.780
in an endocrine study,
which is get rid

00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:05.710
of the guy's testosterone.

00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:08.730
And you castrate the
male, your rodent male,

00:30:08.730 --> 00:30:10.780
your non-human
primate male, and what

00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:16.080
you see is there is a big drop
in levels of sexual behavior.

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:20.640
And this could range from male
lever pressing to get access

00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:23.560
to a female to
courtship displays

00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:27.170
to extent of pomading
of hair or something

00:30:27.170 --> 00:30:30.180
in the right neighborhoods,
and whatever the measure is,

00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:33.390
this is when normal testosterone
levels are on board.

00:30:33.390 --> 00:30:39.030
And this is after castration,
a very, very dramatic drop.

00:30:39.030 --> 00:30:43.200
Now to fulfill the second
ironclad requirement

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:46.050
in endocrinology, the last
thing you need to do now

00:30:46.050 --> 00:30:50.340
is after the
subtraction experiment,

00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:52.310
to do a replacement one.

00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:55.180
Artificially give
back the normal levels

00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:58.430
to the castrated individual,
and levels of sexual behavior

00:30:58.430 --> 00:30:59.800
go back to there.

00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:00.521
Whoa.

00:31:00.521 --> 00:31:01.020
OK.

00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:05.180
That proves that we have a
causal relationship here.

00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:06.970
Not so fast.

00:31:06.970 --> 00:31:11.830
First thing to note, which
is 0% testosterone and sexual

00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:13.860
behavior goes way, way down.

00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:15.610
It doesn't go to zero.

00:31:15.610 --> 00:31:18.190
In every species
looked at, starting

00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:21.420
with the embarrassing sexual
behavior of everyone's pet dogs

00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:24.750
when they were six years old,
even after being neutered, what

00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:28.680
you see is there's a level
of residual sexual behavior--

00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:32.230
rodents, dogs, primates,
including humans.

00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:34.140
This is a critical point.

00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:37.480
How much residual
sexual behavior

00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:39.630
is there after castration?

00:31:39.630 --> 00:31:43.740
The more sexual experience
before castration,

00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:47.650
the more there is going
to be retained afterward.

00:31:47.650 --> 00:31:52.380
In other words, on a certain
like totally artificial level,

00:31:52.380 --> 00:31:54.170
this amount of
sexual behavior is

00:31:54.170 --> 00:31:56.150
being driven by testosterone.

00:31:56.150 --> 00:31:58.650
This amount, which
persists here,

00:31:58.650 --> 00:32:00.910
is being driven by
social experience.

00:32:00.910 --> 00:32:03.480
It's got nothing to
do with the hormones.

00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:05.520
Yes, this is ridiculous
dichotomizing

00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:08.500
into this, but the fact
that it doesn't go to zero,

00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:10.700
and the fact that the
more sexual experience

00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:14.240
pre-castration, the more
residual behavior, this

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:16.740
is a vote for just
how much of a role

00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:21.210
social experience, social
conditioning plays.

00:32:21.210 --> 00:32:23.650
Next thing that takes
away from the yes,

00:32:23.650 --> 00:32:25.630
it's all caused
by testosterone--

00:32:25.630 --> 00:32:28.270
now you do an
elaboration on the study.

00:32:28.270 --> 00:32:31.870
You castrate a male,
and now instead

00:32:31.870 --> 00:32:35.040
of replacing with
100% of normal levels,

00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:38.870
you give 10% of
normal levels, or you

00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:41.580
give 200% of normal levels.

00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:43.060
And what do you wind up seeing?

00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:47.070
If testosterone plays a
strictly causative role, even

00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:50.040
in this range, you are
going to get something--

00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:52.050
this is going to
be lower than 100%,

00:32:52.050 --> 00:32:53.530
and this is going to be higher.

00:32:53.530 --> 00:32:56.310
That's not what you see.

00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:59.310
Instead, it is
something like that.

00:32:59.310 --> 00:33:01.770
You get roughly the
same reinstatement

00:33:01.770 --> 00:33:07.300
of sexual behavior when you
return testosterone levels

00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:09.890
over anything
roughly approximating

00:33:09.890 --> 00:33:12.490
the normal physiological range.

00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:14.340
What does that tell you?

00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:18.080
The brain circuits we learned
about the other day involved

00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:22.000
in sexual motivation-- it
requires testosterone around

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.610
to work fully, not
entirely, but to work fully.

00:33:25.610 --> 00:33:29.300
But those brain
regions are not really

00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:33.290
all that concerned with the
exact level of testosterone.

00:33:33.290 --> 00:33:37.640
Rough approximation of normal,
rough approximation of normal

00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:39.600
has the exact same effect.

00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:42.220
If you were seeing
a tight relationship

00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:45.920
in a male between the
amount of sexual behavior

00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:48.030
and testosterone
levels, it's not

00:33:48.030 --> 00:33:51.540
because every little smidgen
bit of more testosterone

00:33:51.540 --> 00:33:54.270
is going to drive
more sexual behavior.

00:33:54.270 --> 00:33:57.490
It's because every little
additional smidgen of behavior

00:33:57.490 --> 00:34:00.500
is going to drive higher
testosterone levels.

00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:03.240
So we've got this really
important observation.

00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:07.110
Yes, testosterone is needed
in species after species,

00:34:07.110 --> 00:34:11.290
including humans, for the
normal range of sexual behavior.

00:34:11.290 --> 00:34:15.699
Just as importantly, castration
never drops it down to zero.

00:34:15.699 --> 00:34:18.570
The more social experience,
that whole song and dance,

00:34:18.570 --> 00:34:21.880
and very importantly
as well, the system

00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:24.960
is not sensitive to
little differences

00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:26.580
in testosterone levels.

00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:29.530
Stating that a different
way, if some guy has

00:34:29.530 --> 00:34:32.330
one and 1/2 percent
more testosterone

00:34:32.330 --> 00:34:34.860
on board than the guy
sitting next to him

00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:37.940
or than he had last week,
is that going to mean he

00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:41.270
is going to be more sexually
motivated, more aroused?

00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:42.670
No, not at all.

00:34:42.670 --> 00:34:46.620
Within the normal range, the
system doesn't distinguish it.

00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:49.870
The relevant brain regions
are sensitive to testosterone

00:34:49.870 --> 00:34:54.090
and require it, but do not care
a whole lot about the levels.

00:34:54.090 --> 00:34:57.240
One exception, which is
if you instead of, say,

00:34:57.240 --> 00:35:02.210
200%, push testosterone
levels like 1000%,

00:35:02.210 --> 00:35:07.270
tenfold higher than normal,
this is supraphysiological,

00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:09.670
which means it's out of
the normal range, which

00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:12.810
means no bodies normally
generate those sorts of levels.

00:35:12.810 --> 00:35:15.910
Put it up in that range,
and you will get an increase

00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:18.820
in sexual behavior
and sexual arousal.

00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:20.650
When do you see this?

00:35:20.650 --> 00:35:24.300
The idiots who go and
abuse anabolic steroids

00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:27.400
for their weight lifting or
whatever, people doing that

00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:29.920
are not pushing up their
testosterone levels

00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:34.140
into the higher range of what
human bodies can generate.

00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:37.280
They are pushing it way
above the normal range.

00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:40.850
In that range, you
do see an increase

00:35:40.850 --> 00:35:43.600
in sexual proceptivity.

00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:48.450
In a week or so, what we will
see is the exact same story.

00:35:48.450 --> 00:35:51.170
It will be the exact
same chart here when

00:35:51.170 --> 00:35:53.330
asking the question,
what does testosterone

00:35:53.330 --> 00:35:55.030
have to do with aggression?

00:35:55.030 --> 00:35:58.230
And what you'll see is the
exact same conclusions.

00:35:58.230 --> 00:36:00.400
What are we beginning
to see here?

00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:05.040
That testosterone is not playing
a strictly causative role.

00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:07.140
It is playing one
of the words that

00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:10.420
should be becoming repetitive
here and clearly really

00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:11.140
important.

00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:15.120
Testosterone is playing
a modulatory role.

00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:18.730
What testosterone
does is sensitize you

00:36:18.730 --> 00:36:24.320
towards stimuli that are
evocative of sexual arousal.

00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:27.340
It lowers the
threshold, and that

00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:29.410
could be shown in
all sorts of studies,

00:36:29.410 --> 00:36:33.670
but where it's most clear
cut is in this case.

00:36:33.670 --> 00:36:36.730
Does testosterone cause
this sexual behavior?

00:36:36.730 --> 00:36:40.690
No, but when it is on
board, it facilitates it.

00:36:40.690 --> 00:36:42.270
It modulates it.

00:36:42.270 --> 00:36:44.570
Theme again and again and again.

00:36:44.570 --> 00:36:48.400
And that, obviously, has tons to
do with individual differences.

00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:52.720
One last hormone to mention in
this realm of hormone levels

00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:55.000
over the last couple of
weeks, months, seasons,

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.420
or so-- the hormone melatonin.

00:36:57.420 --> 00:36:59.640
And I think that's the
only time melatonin is

00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:01.090
going to be mentioned in class.

00:37:01.090 --> 00:37:04.800
Melatonin has something to do
with telling the body what time

00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:06.036
of year it is.

00:37:06.036 --> 00:37:10.400
It is responsive to the amount
of light you are exposed to.

00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:12.140
What is melatonin about?

00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:15.510
It is one of the driving
forces on seasonal mating.

00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:19.500
Those species where you
suddenly get on one afternoon

00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:22.650
each year, all the wildebeests
ovulate the same afternoon

00:37:22.650 --> 00:37:25.030
kind of thing-- it
is almost certainly

00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:28.700
a whole pathway in the brain
sensitive to the amount

00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:32.440
of light and the amount of
light per day over recent weeks,

00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:34.640
which by way of
melatonin, triggers

00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:36.850
the onset of the mating season.

00:37:36.850 --> 00:37:39.320
Do humans have a
seasonal mating pattern?

00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:42.420
There's a smidgen
of evidence for it.

00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:45.760
If we've got it, it is
a very, very weak echo

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:49.800
of what you see in
some other species.

00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:53.350
Now we shift over to getting
really way back then.

00:37:53.350 --> 00:37:55.530
Instead of over
your last 28 days

00:37:55.530 --> 00:37:58.290
or over the last three
seasons, now beginning to

00:37:58.290 --> 00:38:01.160
look at perinatal factors.

00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:03.330
Perinatal-- before birth.

00:38:03.330 --> 00:38:05.120
Prenatal-- after birth.

00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:08.030
Postnatal-- very
early development.

00:38:08.030 --> 00:38:11.720
First off, focusing
on early environment,

00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:14.030
environmental factors
having something

00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:16.030
to do with adult
sexual behavior.

00:38:16.030 --> 00:38:18.480
What we can translate
that into is

00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:21.440
ways in which early environment
affects every single one

00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:22.940
of these subsequent ones.

00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:25.080
What does early
environment childhood

00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:28.250
have to do with shaping
of sexual behavior?

00:38:28.250 --> 00:38:32.210
A theme that's also going
to come out in every topic

00:38:32.210 --> 00:38:35.040
we're going to hear of
after this, buzz words that

00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:37.750
should be beginning to be
keeping you awake at night--

00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:41.870
modulatory, contingent,
if then, all that stuff.

00:38:41.870 --> 00:38:43.320
Here is another one.

00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:45.940
Here's another concept
that comes through.

00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:50.870
The evidence shows that there
is very little about early life

00:38:50.870 --> 00:38:55.010
experience, which
influences the quality,

00:38:55.010 --> 00:38:59.400
the way in which an organism
goes about having sex.

00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:01.110
What's another
way of stating it?

00:39:01.110 --> 00:39:04.950
This is a pretty set in stone
bunch of fixed action patterns.

00:39:04.950 --> 00:39:09.720
Early experience is not about
learning how to be sexual.

00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:11.920
Early experience
is about learning

00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:15.810
the appropriate social
contexts for being so.

00:39:15.810 --> 00:39:19.040
And that is shown in
species after species.

00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:21.310
That is what
experience is about.

00:39:21.310 --> 00:39:23.970
Not how to do it,
but when to do it

00:39:23.970 --> 00:39:26.140
and who you should
not in your right mind

00:39:26.140 --> 00:39:29.750
try to do something proceptive
to and things of that sort.

00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:32.069
This is what early
experience is about.

00:39:32.069 --> 00:39:33.610
And what we're going
to see in a week

00:39:33.610 --> 00:39:36.860
is the exact same
boring paragraph.

00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:40.770
Early experience does not teach
organisms how to be aggressive.

00:39:40.770 --> 00:39:43.780
It teaches organisms
the appropriate context

00:39:43.780 --> 00:39:45.910
for being aggressive.

00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:48.930
So what's the sort of evidence
for these early effects?

00:39:48.930 --> 00:39:51.210
One example, the
whole literature

00:39:51.210 --> 00:39:53.790
that emerged that is covered
somewhat in the zebra

00:39:53.790 --> 00:39:57.080
book in another domain, but this
whole literature that emerged

00:39:57.080 --> 00:40:01.500
in the 1950s, work looking
at captive primates, what

00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:04.130
are the consequences
of growing up

00:40:04.130 --> 00:40:06.830
in a certain degree
of social isolation?

00:40:06.830 --> 00:40:09.940
What happens to behavior--
and eventually, people

00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:12.070
studying behavior
and physiology-- what

00:40:12.070 --> 00:40:16.740
happens to behavior in adulthood
if you are a young rhesus

00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:20.880
monkey, who grows up only
with peers and no mother,

00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:23.940
or grows up only with
a mother and no peers,

00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:26.110
or grows up with
Mother being present

00:40:26.110 --> 00:40:29.860
only intermittently, or at
the most extremes, growing up

00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:32.500
with neither mother nor
peers or any other member

00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:33.939
of your species around?

00:40:33.939 --> 00:40:35.730
You will see in the
book a whole discussion

00:40:35.730 --> 00:40:38.060
of the ethics of these
studies, but what

00:40:38.060 --> 00:40:40.520
does your early
social environment

00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:42.960
have to do with things
like sexual behavior?

00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:44.840
And what you see
coming out the end

00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:47.490
is when you looked at
these adult primates,

00:40:47.490 --> 00:40:49.770
since replicated
over and over, they

00:40:49.770 --> 00:40:53.130
go about the sexual behavior
the plain old way that everybody

00:40:53.130 --> 00:40:56.290
else does, but they do
it in totally socially

00:40:56.290 --> 00:40:58.070
inappropriate context.

00:40:58.070 --> 00:41:00.220
And thus, you have
these males who

00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:02.870
were raised in some degree
of isolation early on,

00:41:02.870 --> 00:41:05.330
growing up and carrying
out perfectly normal

00:41:05.330 --> 00:41:09.280
sexual fixed action patterns
on the towel in the room,

00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:13.620
on the bowl of food, on the
who knows what wrong context.

00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:16.920
You have trying to do things
with animals you should not

00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:19.790
go anywhere near in
terms of social dominance

00:41:19.790 --> 00:41:22.260
and such in appropriate context.

00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:26.220
Early experience shaping
not how but when,

00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:29.630
what the if-then clauses are.

00:41:29.630 --> 00:41:34.200
More issues of early experience
shaping adult sexual behavior,

00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:36.290
arousal, proceptivity,
et cetera-- we

00:41:36.290 --> 00:41:38.780
already heard one example
of this with humans.

00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:41.120
That's the whole
kibbutz literature.

00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:43.730
That was that whole
business that if you

00:41:43.730 --> 00:41:48.710
spend lots of intimate time
with somebody before age six,

00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:52.330
what you will do is in some
subliminal imprinting way,

00:41:52.330 --> 00:41:55.100
decide forever after
this individual does not

00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:56.820
feel like a potential mate.

00:41:56.820 --> 00:41:58.960
This individual
feels like a sibling.

00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:02.630
That was the example in the
recognizing relative lecture

00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:04.650
of showing that
hooray, we are such

00:42:04.650 --> 00:42:07.030
a cognitively
sophisticated species.

00:42:07.030 --> 00:42:11.110
We can figure out who's
somebody's fourth cousin three

00:42:11.110 --> 00:42:14.000
steps removed by
thinking, and that's

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:17.240
how we make our mating
decisions, showing instead

00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:20.160
in those studies, there is
this non-conscious level.

00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:24.080
One of the rules that humans
have is lots of exposure

00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:25.910
intimately to somebody
early on in life,

00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:28.710
and you are not going
to be very likely to get

00:42:28.710 --> 00:42:31.640
that proceptive behavior
stuff going on later,

00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:35.210
part of turning them
into a pseudo kin because

00:42:35.210 --> 00:42:37.250
of that early exposure.

00:42:37.250 --> 00:42:39.680
One additional domain
I will touch on here

00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:41.490
in terms of early
experience, which

00:42:41.490 --> 00:42:43.500
is, what does early
experience have

00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:45.990
to do with sexual orientation?

00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:49.180
And depending on which decade
you are asking this question,

00:42:49.180 --> 00:42:51.890
the answer would
range from everything

00:42:51.890 --> 00:42:54.010
to virtually nothing.

00:42:54.010 --> 00:42:58.250
Going back to the virtually
everything time, which

00:42:58.250 --> 00:43:01.560
was dominating sort of the first
half of the 20th century, how

00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:04.130
people thought about the
subject, what you had

00:43:04.130 --> 00:43:08.680
were two broad models for what
sort of early environments

00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:12.980
increase the likelihood of
boys becoming gay as adults.

00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:14.390
And these were the two models.

00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:19.190
The first one was the absence
of a father figure model,

00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:22.210
and this was one
straight out of monkeys

00:43:22.210 --> 00:43:24.500
learning who they should
try to pelvic thrust

00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:25.830
with or some such thing.

00:43:25.830 --> 00:43:30.030
This was the argument that
what do father figures provide?

00:43:30.030 --> 00:43:34.500
Training for appropriate context
for proceptive sexual behavior,

00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:37.940
growing up absent a
father, father figure,

00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:40.950
increasing the
likelihood of being gay.

00:43:40.950 --> 00:43:45.040
The other model was having
this totally pain in the neck

00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:48.480
neurotic screwed up
mother, who, as basically

00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:51.960
said between the lines, makes
you crazy when you grow up,

00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:56.810
and thus you have circa 1950,
psychiatrically certifiable

00:43:56.810 --> 00:44:00.470
disorder of having a
different sexual orientation.

00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:02.980
Obviously, where I'm
going to head right now

00:44:02.980 --> 00:44:06.270
is there has not been a
slightest shred of evidence

00:44:06.270 --> 00:44:09.420
over the years either for
the missing father figure

00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:13.630
model of sexual orientation or
the neurotic mothering style

00:44:13.630 --> 00:44:14.670
model.

00:44:14.670 --> 00:44:16.090
Complete nonsense.

00:44:16.090 --> 00:44:19.940
Nonetheless, dominating thinking
about what was going on there.

00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:20.500
OK.

00:44:20.500 --> 00:44:22.550
So what we are now
ready to shift to

00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:26.230
is what's going on with hormones
around this time period.

00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:31.180
Let's take our five-minute
break, and then we'll resume.

00:44:31.180 --> 00:44:34.760
Looking at what perinatal
hormone levels have

00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:37.080
to do with adult
sexual behavior,

00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:39.030
and you already know the answer.

00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:40.980
You know it in
your hearts by now,

00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:44.800
which is, well, it depends on
what species you're looking at.

00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:47.600
And what we will see is a
very similar thing to the rule

00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:50.720
there, which is in
lots of species,

00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:55.410
rodent species, prenatal or
perinatal hormonal environment

00:44:55.410 --> 00:44:59.160
has everything to do with
adult sexual behavior.

00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:00.900
And by the time
we get to humans,

00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:05.170
what we'll see is maybe kind of
sort of more research needed.

00:45:05.170 --> 00:45:08.060
What we begin with
here, implicit in that,

00:45:08.060 --> 00:45:11.280
is a dichotomy that runs
through all of endocrinology

00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:13.140
when thinking about behavior.

00:45:13.140 --> 00:45:16.340
The effects of hormones
back when you were little,

00:45:16.340 --> 00:45:20.430
jargon in the field, an
organizational effect

00:45:20.430 --> 00:45:21.750
of the hormone.

00:45:21.750 --> 00:45:24.200
And what that is
about is explicitly

00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:26.950
is what are hormones
doing at a time in terms

00:45:26.950 --> 00:45:30.640
of organizing what kind of
brain you're developing there.

00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:33.970
Effects of hormones,
instead, in this range or so,

00:45:33.970 --> 00:45:39.010
what you are talking about is
an activational hormonal effect.

00:45:39.010 --> 00:45:41.700
So this is a very sort
of consistent dichotomy

00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:44.890
that people in the business
use, early, early hormonal

00:45:44.890 --> 00:45:47.460
environments having
organizational effects

00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:49.900
on the nervous system,
hormones forever

00:45:49.900 --> 00:45:52.090
after having
activational effects.

00:45:52.090 --> 00:45:54.780
So what you see is
in rodent species

00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:58.020
that perinatal
hormone exposure has

00:45:58.020 --> 00:46:01.330
massive organizational
effects that dramatically

00:46:01.330 --> 00:46:03.830
influence sexual behavior.

00:46:03.830 --> 00:46:08.290
What you also see is it's not
so dramatic and clear cut.

00:46:08.290 --> 00:46:11.050
A whole literature
initially suggesting that,

00:46:11.050 --> 00:46:14.220
for example, male
rodents, if they are not

00:46:14.220 --> 00:46:16.680
exposed to testosterone,
perinatally,

00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:20.390
will have a different male
rodent sexual orientation later

00:46:20.390 --> 00:46:22.570
on, a dichotomous outcome.

00:46:22.570 --> 00:46:24.800
What a huge literature
now shows is

00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:28.770
something that is evident to
every sort of human sexologist

00:46:28.770 --> 00:46:33.040
for centuries, which is it's
not a dichotomous function.

00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:37.320
It is on a continuum in
terms of sexual orientation,

00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:41.630
and 300 different species
have been documented by now

00:46:41.630 --> 00:46:46.040
to have both heterosexual
and homosexual behavior

00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:49.310
at different times in
naturalistic settings.

00:46:49.310 --> 00:46:53.760
So perinatal hormones
having organizing effects

00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:56.350
on adult sexual
orientation-- what you see

00:46:56.350 --> 00:47:00.000
is these are not all or
none properties at all.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:01.310
What else?

00:47:01.310 --> 00:47:02.040
OK.

00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:05.890
What you see specifically
in non-human primates

00:47:05.890 --> 00:47:08.380
is perinatal period.

00:47:08.380 --> 00:47:13.330
Expose a female monkey fetus
to high testosterone levels,

00:47:13.330 --> 00:47:17.750
and what you will do is
masculinize the brain.

00:47:17.750 --> 00:47:21.620
Masculinize the brain, having,
thus, an organizational effect.

00:47:21.620 --> 00:47:24.600
What does masculinization
then manifest itself

00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:26.440
as in adulthood?

00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:31.000
If nothing else is different,
it has no effects at all.

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:35.990
On the other hand, if you
inject a female monkey who

00:47:35.990 --> 00:47:40.320
is masculinized perinatally, if
you inject her with androgens,

00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:44.790
with testosterone, you get a
wild burst of male fixed action

00:47:44.790 --> 00:47:45.980
patterns.

00:47:45.980 --> 00:47:49.120
In other words, you've
got an if-then clause.

00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:54.536
If and only if there was
prenatal masculinization,

00:47:54.536 --> 00:47:59.280
then testosterone will have
an acute activational effect

00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:02.660
on sexual behavior.

00:48:02.660 --> 00:48:04.623
Translating this.

00:48:15.541 --> 00:48:16.040
OK.

00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:18.640
So in the absence in a
normal female monkey,

00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:21.800
in the absence of prenatal
androgens or adult androgen

00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:24.930
levels, this is the amount
of male fixed action

00:48:24.930 --> 00:48:26.480
pattern sexual behavior.

00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:32.270
Now prenatal androgenization--
normal low action levels

00:48:32.270 --> 00:48:34.530
in adulthood.

00:48:34.530 --> 00:48:35.980
Same low levels.

00:48:35.980 --> 00:48:40.460
Now no prenatal androgenization,
and exposure to androgens

00:48:40.460 --> 00:48:42.460
in adulthood-- same low levels.

00:48:42.460 --> 00:48:45.980
Prenatal exposure and
acute activational effects,

00:48:45.980 --> 00:48:49.850
and suddenly, you get high rates
of male typical fixed action

00:48:49.850 --> 00:48:50.630
patterns.

00:48:50.630 --> 00:48:55.330
So what we've got here is
a contingent organizational

00:48:55.330 --> 00:48:55.870
effect.

00:48:55.870 --> 00:48:59.270
Yet again, one of our
if-then clauses, this one

00:48:59.270 --> 00:49:03.770
not being an if this
physiology is going on only

00:49:03.770 --> 00:49:08.310
in this social environment, then
if this early life endocrine

00:49:08.310 --> 00:49:12.810
environment occurs coupled with
this acute adult one, then.

00:49:12.810 --> 00:49:14.401
Yeah, question.

00:49:14.401 --> 00:49:14.900
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:22.770
That is a great question,
and as you're about to see,

00:49:22.770 --> 00:49:25.540
the answer is so
insanely complicated, you

00:49:25.540 --> 00:49:28.310
are going to regret having
asked that question for days.

00:49:28.310 --> 00:49:31.342
But you are going to
find out about it anyway.

00:49:31.342 --> 00:49:33.300
Apropos of that, I just
forgot a great question

00:49:33.300 --> 00:49:35.510
during the break, which
is, OK, when you've

00:49:35.510 --> 00:49:39.280
got those weightlifter
folks, they're

00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:42.540
abusing their steroids,
their anabolic steroids,

00:49:42.540 --> 00:49:45.370
their testosterone-derived
drugs, when you push things up

00:49:45.370 --> 00:49:48.190
into the
supraphysiological range,

00:49:48.190 --> 00:49:50.690
higher than the body
normally ever comes up with,

00:49:50.690 --> 00:49:53.690
do you see a phenomenon
from last Wednesday?

00:49:53.690 --> 00:49:56.570
Does the body down
regulate the number

00:49:56.570 --> 00:49:58.470
of testosterone receptors?

00:49:58.470 --> 00:50:02.200
And you see exactly the case,
but you could never down

00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:04.930
regulate them low
enough to compensate

00:50:04.930 --> 00:50:07.820
for the huge screaming
testosterone signal.

00:50:07.820 --> 00:50:13.240
It is a partially successful
compensatory response.

00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:16.140
What have you got
in terms of humans,

00:50:16.140 --> 00:50:20.060
in terms of perinatal
androgenization of females?

00:50:20.060 --> 00:50:23.490
And people used to know
exactly the answer to it.

00:50:23.490 --> 00:50:27.320
First off, when do you get
human females as fetuses

00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:29.810
and as predominately in
humans prenatal, rather than

00:50:29.810 --> 00:50:31.120
postnatal effects?

00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:34.490
It depends on how fast,
how much of development

00:50:34.490 --> 00:50:36.860
occurs before birth,
but in humans,

00:50:36.860 --> 00:50:40.150
when are circumstances
where female fetuses will

00:50:40.150 --> 00:50:41.890
get heavily androgenized?

00:50:41.890 --> 00:50:44.480
Historically, two circumstances.

00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:48.000
One is in the case
of a disease where

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:50.220
there is something wrong
with the adrenal glands,

00:50:50.220 --> 00:50:53.190
and they pump out
tons of testosterone.

00:50:53.190 --> 00:50:55.649
You remember, if I
actually did say this,

00:50:55.649 --> 00:50:57.690
and if I didn't, I hope
you're not remembering it

00:50:57.690 --> 00:51:00.520
hallucinatorily,
but you'll remember

00:51:00.520 --> 00:51:04.700
that the adrenal glands make a
certain amount of testosterone,

00:51:04.700 --> 00:51:07.580
and in females, it
pumps out maybe 5%

00:51:07.580 --> 00:51:08.880
the levels that males do.

00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:13.350
When you have this disease of
an overactive adrenal system,

00:51:13.350 --> 00:51:16.890
you pump out way too high
of levels of testosterone,

00:51:16.890 --> 00:51:21.930
a disease called congenital
adrenal hyperplasia.

00:51:21.930 --> 00:51:26.300
Hyperplasia, the
number of cells-- OK,

00:51:26.300 --> 00:51:28.110
come up with a limerick
about that one.

00:51:28.110 --> 00:51:28.970
I dare you.

00:51:28.970 --> 00:51:30.610
Is it possible to
come up with a haiku?

00:51:30.610 --> 00:51:33.935
How many syllables are there in
congenital adrenal hyperplasia?

00:51:33.935 --> 00:51:36.270
Well, it depends if we're
talking about rodents or not.

00:51:36.270 --> 00:51:38.470
So congenital
adrenal hyperplasia,

00:51:38.470 --> 00:51:42.530
a genetic and inborn error
of metabolism in the adrenal

00:51:42.530 --> 00:51:45.850
glands, and you pump out
huge amounts of androgen.

00:51:45.850 --> 00:51:49.390
So suddenly, there is a world
of the occasional girl, who

00:51:49.390 --> 00:51:53.250
was born suffering from
this disorder or the mother

00:51:53.250 --> 00:51:55.470
suffering from it during
pregnancy, who has

00:51:55.470 --> 00:51:58.030
been prenatally androgenized.

00:51:58.030 --> 00:52:00.600
The other population,
thanks to a drug that

00:52:00.600 --> 00:52:04.070
was very popular in the
1950s, a drug that decreased

00:52:04.070 --> 00:52:07.410
the likelihood of miscarriage
that was very heavily used

00:52:07.410 --> 00:52:11.980
at points around then, a drug
called diethylstilbestrol, DES.

00:52:11.980 --> 00:52:15.740
And in a subset of
women, their biochemistry

00:52:15.740 --> 00:52:20.210
was such that a lot of the DES
was converted to androgens.

00:52:20.210 --> 00:52:25.040
So you had kids, who were
prenatally androgenized, girls,

00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:27.700
either because of this
congenital adrenal hyperplasia

00:52:27.700 --> 00:52:30.360
or because of DES exposure.

00:52:30.360 --> 00:52:33.450
So then the question
immediately becomes, OK,

00:52:33.450 --> 00:52:35.740
so what are they like afterward?

00:52:35.740 --> 00:52:39.110
And this prompted the
great, large, massive set

00:52:39.110 --> 00:52:42.780
of studies on the CAH, the
congenital adrenal hyperplasia,

00:52:42.780 --> 00:52:45.170
on the CAH girls
as they grow up,

00:52:45.170 --> 00:52:48.020
and you knew exactly what
the expectation was straight

00:52:48.020 --> 00:52:50.600
out of primates here,
non-human primates, which

00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:53.850
was this was going to
have masculinizing effects

00:52:53.850 --> 00:52:55.790
on their behavior.

00:52:55.790 --> 00:52:58.630
And what was shown
was in adulthood,

00:52:58.630 --> 00:53:00.460
there were all sorts
of differences.

00:53:00.460 --> 00:53:01.660
No, not just in adulthood.

00:53:01.660 --> 00:53:03.410
Starting around
adolescence, there

00:53:03.410 --> 00:53:06.760
were all sorts of differences
in the behaviors of these girls,

00:53:06.760 --> 00:53:09.980
and as we'll see next week,
a whole cluster of them

00:53:09.980 --> 00:53:13.040
were thought to fall into the
realm of aggressive behavior.

00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:15.850
But what we're seeing
here was eventually,

00:53:15.850 --> 00:53:19.400
a higher likelihood
of becoming a lesbian

00:53:19.400 --> 00:53:21.110
in terms of sexual orientation.

00:53:21.110 --> 00:53:21.970
Whoa.

00:53:21.970 --> 00:53:24.480
What we've just shown
is prenatal androgens,

00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:27.210
and you produce a
lesbian later on.

00:53:27.210 --> 00:53:30.090
That's just-- there's a little
problem with these studies,

00:53:30.090 --> 00:53:32.040
a slight confound,
and one that's

00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:33.670
going to be very
pertinent next week

00:53:33.670 --> 00:53:36.320
as well when talking about
the aggression stuff.

00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:39.770
The confound being if you
were prenatally androgenized,

00:53:39.770 --> 00:53:43.380
you would get born with
kind of weirdo genitals,

00:53:43.380 --> 00:53:46.210
and you would have sort
of intersexual genitals

00:53:46.210 --> 00:53:47.580
in all sorts of ways.

00:53:47.580 --> 00:53:49.840
And all of these
girls typically had

00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:52.300
to have gone through
a dozen rounds

00:53:52.300 --> 00:53:54.810
of reconstructive
plastic surgery

00:53:54.810 --> 00:53:56.910
over the first
decade of your life.

00:53:56.910 --> 00:53:59.950
These were not girls where the
only thing different about them

00:53:59.950 --> 00:54:02.530
was what sort of hormones
their brains were marinating

00:54:02.530 --> 00:54:04.270
in back when they were fetuses.

00:54:04.270 --> 00:54:08.460
These are girls who grow up with
this really interesting part

00:54:08.460 --> 00:54:10.320
of the body that
all sorts of people

00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:13.300
seem kind of creeped out about,
but doctors are endlessly

00:54:13.300 --> 00:54:16.490
examining, and all sorts
of painful surgeries.

00:54:16.490 --> 00:54:18.760
And this literature
was completely

00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:20.800
confounded by the
fact that there

00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:25.890
was all this masculinization
of genitalia and a whole world

00:54:25.890 --> 00:54:30.030
of surgeries, often confusion
about gender assignment

00:54:30.030 --> 00:54:31.260
early on in life.

00:54:31.260 --> 00:54:35.280
Things were not merely a
change in the hormone levels.

00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:38.100
So it remains
relatively unclear.

00:54:38.100 --> 00:54:40.650
There is by now, at this
point, weak evidence

00:54:40.650 --> 00:54:43.260
of prenatal
androgenization increasing

00:54:43.260 --> 00:54:47.400
the likelihood of a woman
being gay as an adult.

00:54:47.400 --> 00:54:50.550
I'm seeing here in my notes
I have the words Indonesia,

00:54:50.550 --> 00:54:53.140
tomboy, and Hobson Jobson.

00:54:53.140 --> 00:54:55.050
And I haven't a clue
what that's about.

00:54:55.050 --> 00:54:58.350
So we will just skip over that.

00:54:58.350 --> 00:54:59.780
OK.

00:54:59.780 --> 00:55:02.770
What we begin to see
here is another feature

00:55:02.770 --> 00:55:04.290
of early experience.

00:55:04.290 --> 00:55:08.340
What does-- where were we--
prenatal endocrine environment

00:55:08.340 --> 00:55:11.760
have to do with
sexual identification?

00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:14.790
Which is different than who
you are sexually attracted,

00:55:14.790 --> 00:55:17.550
but rather what sex you
feel yourself to be.

00:55:17.550 --> 00:55:21.660
And what we heard the other day
with the transsexualism example

00:55:21.660 --> 00:55:26.590
is you could have gender being
dictated by your chromosomes

00:55:26.590 --> 00:55:31.450
and which organ, which
types of gonads you have

00:55:31.450 --> 00:55:33.840
and hormones and all of
that, but that is not

00:55:33.840 --> 00:55:36.860
enough to determine that there
are clearly other things that

00:55:36.860 --> 00:55:40.070
can happen that could produce
a very, very different gender

00:55:40.070 --> 00:55:41.680
identity.

00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:45.400
What also was seen from that
literature of individuals

00:55:45.400 --> 00:55:49.180
who were born intersexual where
they have sexually ambiguous,

00:55:49.180 --> 00:55:54.070
gender ambiguous genitalia
is it is far from clear

00:55:54.070 --> 00:55:56.570
which decision to
make, whether that

00:55:56.570 --> 00:55:59.010
was made circa
1950s by the surgeon

00:55:59.010 --> 00:56:00.930
with no consultation
with the parents,

00:56:00.930 --> 00:56:04.410
or, fortunately, these days,
a very different scenario

00:56:04.410 --> 00:56:07.960
in terms of how successful
the assignment is

00:56:07.960 --> 00:56:10.150
by the individuals
in the outside world.

00:56:10.150 --> 00:56:14.010
What's going on in terms
of sexual identity inside?

00:56:14.010 --> 00:56:18.360
Now what this begins to bring
up is the most miserable,

00:56:18.360 --> 00:56:21.540
irritating, confusing
thing about the effects

00:56:21.540 --> 00:56:23.900
of steroid hormones
in the brain, which is

00:56:23.900 --> 00:56:25.290
where your question came from.

00:56:25.290 --> 00:56:27.750
And this is where you're all
going to start to regret this,

00:56:27.750 --> 00:56:31.990
but it actually is necessary
in terms of an important point.

00:56:31.990 --> 00:56:35.600
So you've got testosterone,
and what does testosterone do?

00:56:35.600 --> 00:56:41.130
We know already it binds
to testosterone receptors,

00:56:41.130 --> 00:56:44.080
testosterone receptor, and
does its steroid hormone

00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:46.060
transcription factor deal.

00:56:46.060 --> 00:56:50.680
Throughout the 1970s, there
was an astonishing amount

00:56:50.680 --> 00:56:54.720
of confusing irritative research
done showing the two following

00:56:54.720 --> 00:56:56.160
things.

00:56:56.160 --> 00:56:58.820
In some parts of the
body, testosterone

00:56:58.820 --> 00:57:01.620
has its effect as testosterone.

00:57:01.620 --> 00:57:04.030
It binds to the
testosterone receptor.

00:57:04.030 --> 00:57:08.480
In some parts of the body,
there is biochemical conversion

00:57:08.480 --> 00:57:10.830
of testosterone to something
called dihydrotestosterone.

00:57:13.290 --> 00:57:13.790
OK.

00:57:13.790 --> 00:57:14.846
It's not testosterone.

00:57:14.846 --> 00:57:16.470
It's a little bit
different chemically.

00:57:16.470 --> 00:57:18.700
It binds to the same
testosterone receptors.

00:57:18.700 --> 00:57:20.520
It works a little
bit differently.

00:57:20.520 --> 00:57:22.370
OK, we can live with that.

00:57:22.370 --> 00:57:25.150
The thing that had people
jumping off buildings

00:57:25.150 --> 00:57:28.070
was the discovery at
the time that some

00:57:28.070 --> 00:57:32.490
of testosterone's actions are
due to it being biochemically

00:57:32.490 --> 00:57:36.470
converted to estrogen,
which then binds

00:57:36.470 --> 00:57:41.401
to estrogen receptors and
causes male typical behaviors.

00:57:41.401 --> 00:57:41.900
OK.

00:57:41.900 --> 00:57:44.446
It's at this point that about
half the people in the field

00:57:44.446 --> 00:57:45.820
quit and went to
business school,

00:57:45.820 --> 00:57:49.710
because this was so confusing
and impossible and all of that.

00:57:49.710 --> 00:57:53.280
This consumed years
of labor of people

00:57:53.280 --> 00:57:54.810
trying to sort this one out.

00:57:54.810 --> 00:57:56.810
It goes as follows.

00:57:56.810 --> 00:58:00.430
Once testosterone
enters a target cell,

00:58:00.430 --> 00:58:02.760
if this is the scenario
that's going to happen,

00:58:02.760 --> 00:58:05.010
it's inside the cell.

00:58:05.010 --> 00:58:09.930
The testosterone is turned
to estrogen. In other words,

00:58:09.930 --> 00:58:13.110
this weirdo phenomenon has
no effect on circulating

00:58:13.110 --> 00:58:14.180
testosterone levels.

00:58:14.180 --> 00:58:17.790
It's only in target cells
that have the enzyme that

00:58:17.790 --> 00:58:19.040
could do that conversion.

00:58:19.040 --> 00:58:19.540
OK.

00:58:19.540 --> 00:58:22.010
So it's an intracellular
phenomenon.

00:58:22.010 --> 00:58:25.260
If this is leaving you
totally in the dust,

00:58:25.260 --> 00:58:28.460
don't worry about it, except for
a small point coming in awhile.

00:58:28.460 --> 00:58:30.470
But if you want to devote
the rest of your life

00:58:30.470 --> 00:58:32.074
to figuring this
out in more detail,

00:58:32.074 --> 00:58:33.490
there is something
wrong with you.

00:58:33.490 --> 00:58:36.490
But what you've
got here is normal

00:58:36.490 --> 00:58:39.000
circulating levels,
but different effects

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:40.010
throughout the body.

00:58:40.010 --> 00:58:43.890
In general, what is found is
the effects of testosterone

00:58:43.890 --> 00:58:48.960
in the brain involve this
turning into estrogen,

00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:51.620
as symbolized meaninglessly
by that asterisk.

00:58:51.620 --> 00:58:56.230
Throughout the genitals
or throughout the body,

00:58:56.230 --> 00:58:59.820
and secondary sexual
areas of skin and such,

00:58:59.820 --> 00:59:02.850
testosterone exerts its
effects by being turned

00:59:02.850 --> 00:59:04.670
into dihydrotestosterone.

00:59:04.670 --> 00:59:07.190
And whatever parts are
left over at that point,

00:59:07.190 --> 00:59:09.980
testosterone just does
its regular old thing.

00:59:09.980 --> 00:59:13.960
So this is incredibly
confusing how this can be.

00:59:13.960 --> 00:59:16.690
Immediately, or not so
immediately, two things

00:59:16.690 --> 00:59:17.700
should come to mind.

00:59:17.700 --> 00:59:22.280
OK, so prenatal
testosterone levels

00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:24.650
are going about
their normal prenatal

00:59:24.650 --> 00:59:28.520
organizational masculinization
effects, and part of it

00:59:28.520 --> 00:59:30.520
is on how the brain organizes.

00:59:30.520 --> 00:59:36.150
So what we just saw was prenatal
neurobiological masculinization

00:59:36.150 --> 00:59:39.270
requires testosterone
to be working

00:59:39.270 --> 00:59:43.260
like estrogen in the brain.

00:59:43.260 --> 00:59:47.730
Why don't all the female
fetuses then get androgenized?

00:59:47.730 --> 00:59:50.930
Since they're not generating
estrogen right on site there

00:59:50.930 --> 00:59:53.100
within the cell, but
they're getting estrogen

00:59:53.100 --> 00:59:55.860
through some other route
as their fetal ovaries

00:59:55.860 --> 00:59:56.650
start to work.

00:59:56.650 --> 01:00:00.220
Why isn't mom and her
estrogen androgenizing

01:00:00.220 --> 01:00:02.230
every single fetus out there?

01:00:02.230 --> 01:00:04.970
How is it possible
to ever get a female?

01:00:04.970 --> 01:00:07.590
And the answer to
that is there is

01:00:07.590 --> 01:00:11.370
a protein, which occurs
during pregnancy,

01:00:11.370 --> 01:00:14.050
that occurs in the circulation.

01:00:14.050 --> 01:00:18.240
And what it does is
it binds estrogen,

01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:20.040
and it takes it out of action.

01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:22.476
It leads to estrogen
being degraded.

01:00:22.476 --> 01:00:27.440
In other words, estrogen in
the bloodstream of a fetus

01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:30.970
never has an effect on
any cells in the body.

01:00:30.970 --> 01:00:33.800
Estrogen, whether derived from
the female fetus beginning

01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:37.820
to get her ovaries going there,
or from mom's circulation,

01:00:37.820 --> 01:00:40.120
the estrogen has no effect.

01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:42.710
And in other words,
the only fetuses

01:00:42.710 --> 01:00:45.980
that ever have estrogen
inside their neurons

01:00:45.980 --> 01:00:49.080
are fetuses that are male,
where the estrogen came

01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:51.160
from testosterone.

01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:53.720
So you have to
have this protein,

01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:56.270
and it's something
called alpha fetoprotein.

01:00:56.270 --> 01:00:57.990
It only occurs in fetal life.

01:00:57.990 --> 01:00:59.540
This winds up
being the solution.

01:00:59.540 --> 01:01:02.250
What is implicit
in that, you do not

01:01:02.250 --> 01:01:07.350
get the organizational
feminizing effects of hormones

01:01:07.350 --> 01:01:10.730
prenatally because of
estrogen, because you've just

01:01:10.730 --> 01:01:12.030
guaranteed that doesn't happen.

01:01:12.030 --> 01:01:14.380
You're getting androgenizing
effects that way.

01:01:14.380 --> 01:01:17.100
You don't get prenatal
feminizing effects

01:01:17.100 --> 01:01:20.920
from estrogen. Where does the
brain feminization come from?

01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:23.650
The irritating
answer back when was

01:01:23.650 --> 01:01:26.260
this was always-- sort
of the same phrase

01:01:26.260 --> 01:01:30.760
was always used that the female
brain is a default brain.

01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:37.240
You have to actively in a
muscular excited chopping down

01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:39.290
the trees and clearing
the prairie sort of way,

01:01:39.290 --> 01:01:41.470
you have to actively
do something hormonal

01:01:41.470 --> 01:01:43.110
to masculinize a brain.

01:01:43.110 --> 01:01:45.960
And in the absence of that,
you just kind of wind up

01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:47.840
with one of them female brains.

01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:51.290
What's clear now is this default
model was not really the case.

01:01:51.290 --> 01:01:53.970
It's other hormones that
are doing that there.

01:01:53.970 --> 01:01:54.470
OK.

01:01:54.470 --> 01:01:57.380
So this totally confusing,
irritating thing

01:01:57.380 --> 01:02:01.060
that everybody had to assimilate
at the time of testosterone

01:02:01.060 --> 01:02:04.340
having different effects,
having been converted

01:02:04.340 --> 01:02:06.900
to different messengers in
different parts of the body,

01:02:06.900 --> 01:02:12.440
and that having to produce this
whole complex Rube Goldberg

01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:15.980
sort of solution as to
how to ever get a female.

01:02:15.980 --> 01:02:19.150
Now one additional
interesting implication--

01:02:19.150 --> 01:02:23.170
back to, you remember the other
week, remember-- actually,

01:02:23.170 --> 01:02:27.090
did I talk about it, or
was it two years ago?

01:02:27.090 --> 01:02:27.950
Jeez.

01:02:27.950 --> 01:02:28.610
OK.

01:02:28.610 --> 01:02:32.020
I think I mentioned
testicular feminized males.

01:02:32.020 --> 01:02:32.620
Yes.

01:02:32.620 --> 01:02:32.930
Good.

01:02:32.930 --> 01:02:33.429
OK.

01:02:33.429 --> 01:02:35.530
Thank you for the grounding.

01:02:35.530 --> 01:02:37.400
You remember when
those folks were about.

01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:40.650
This was someone who was
phenotypically a girl

01:02:40.650 --> 01:02:43.430
and would not hit
puberty, would not

01:02:43.430 --> 01:02:48.190
start menstruating until
every other kid in her grade

01:02:48.190 --> 01:02:50.220
had, and it still
hasn't happened,

01:02:50.220 --> 01:02:51.230
still hasn't happened.

01:02:51.230 --> 01:02:53.510
And you take her to the
doctor, and what is discovered

01:02:53.510 --> 01:02:55.260
is that she is not female.

01:02:55.260 --> 01:02:57.860
She is a testicular
feminized male,

01:02:57.860 --> 01:02:59.740
and we went through
exactly what the building

01:02:59.740 --> 01:03:01.110
blocks were of that.

01:03:01.110 --> 01:03:04.150
The individual is
chromosomally male,

01:03:04.150 --> 01:03:07.610
has testes, undescended
testes, is producing

01:03:07.610 --> 01:03:08.990
tons and tons of testosterone.

01:03:08.990 --> 01:03:11.000
What was the problem there?

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:12.970
We knew already it
was the mutation

01:03:12.970 --> 01:03:15.980
in the testosterone receptor.

01:03:15.980 --> 01:03:19.510
So if testosterone
is not able to send

01:03:19.510 --> 01:03:22.020
a signal through the
testosterone receptor,

01:03:22.020 --> 01:03:26.050
you don't get a male
phenotype, and you

01:03:26.050 --> 01:03:30.000
get an individual whose
sexual identity is female,

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.450
because these are
people who are girls

01:03:32.450 --> 01:03:34.460
and grow up to
become women, women

01:03:34.460 --> 01:03:36.090
who simply can't reproduce.

01:03:36.090 --> 01:03:41.140
But otherwise, the sexual
identification is female.

01:03:41.140 --> 01:03:43.090
This should be
really puzzling now,

01:03:43.090 --> 01:03:45.560
because what we've
just seen is if you

01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:48.950
have this mutation in the
testosterone receptor,

01:03:48.950 --> 01:03:52.130
you're not going to get
any signaling mediated

01:03:52.130 --> 01:03:54.170
by testosterone.

01:03:54.170 --> 01:03:56.850
You're not going to get
any signaling mediated

01:03:56.850 --> 01:03:59.160
by dihydrotestosterone.

01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:01.740
But you're going to
get perfectly normal

01:04:01.740 --> 01:04:04.280
masculinization of
the brain by way

01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:07.070
of estrogen. In
other words, people

01:04:07.070 --> 01:04:09.950
who were testicular
feminized males, who

01:04:09.950 --> 01:04:12.280
in terms of their
sex identification,

01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:14.810
have been female from
day one and will be

01:04:14.810 --> 01:04:18.590
for their entire lives,
nonetheless, prenatally

01:04:18.590 --> 01:04:21.690
they had masculinization
organizational effects

01:04:21.690 --> 01:04:22.630
on the brain.

01:04:22.630 --> 01:04:24.220
What does that tell you?

01:04:24.220 --> 01:04:27.260
All of this great hormone
stuff, in some cases,

01:04:27.260 --> 01:04:32.510
doesn't hold a candle to social
sex identity assignment, which

01:04:32.510 --> 01:04:34.850
is when you have
somebody growing up

01:04:34.850 --> 01:04:39.080
with a certain gender's
genitals, and all of you

01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:41.210
treat that individual as a girl.

01:04:41.210 --> 01:04:43.890
It turns out virtually
100% of the time,

01:04:43.890 --> 01:04:47.480
it doesn't matter that you
still had this pathway working

01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:48.440
prenatally.

01:04:48.440 --> 01:04:53.710
All the social cueing produces
a female sexual identity.

01:04:53.710 --> 01:04:57.130
So we've just gotten a big,
big vote here for this.

01:04:57.130 --> 01:04:59.990
It's doing all sorts of
exciting endocrine stuff there,

01:04:59.990 --> 01:05:02.990
which nonetheless,
may not hold a candle

01:05:02.990 --> 01:05:07.030
to some social environmental
factors at this end.

01:05:07.030 --> 01:05:07.660
OK.

01:05:07.660 --> 01:05:11.359
What else do we have here?

01:05:11.359 --> 01:05:12.900
Something I don't
want to talk about.

01:05:12.900 --> 01:05:13.410
OK.

01:05:13.410 --> 01:05:18.650
So hurtling on, now we are ready
to move back another box here,

01:05:18.650 --> 01:05:20.450
which is genetics.

01:05:20.450 --> 01:05:24.030
What does the genetic makeup
up of an individual, not of

01:05:24.030 --> 01:05:26.570
a population or
species, what do genes

01:05:26.570 --> 01:05:29.050
have to do with sexual behavior?

01:05:29.050 --> 01:05:33.050
And the answer is lots of
things, starting with the fact

01:05:33.050 --> 01:05:37.880
that genes determine which
gonads you make as a fetus.

01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:40.900
And thus, that determines
which sex hormones

01:05:40.900 --> 01:05:42.810
you were secreting,
and thus, that

01:05:42.810 --> 01:05:45.580
determines what sort of
genitals you wind up with

01:05:45.580 --> 01:05:49.460
and secondary sexual stuff, and
off you go running with that.

01:05:49.460 --> 01:05:53.100
And we've seen that nonetheless,
that can be blunted by,

01:05:53.100 --> 01:05:56.380
depending on the environment,
the testicular feminized

01:05:56.380 --> 01:05:58.760
male pathway here showing that.

01:05:58.760 --> 01:06:04.070
So genes play a role in terms
of just sheer sex determination.

01:06:04.070 --> 01:06:08.610
What is known about genes
and sexual orientation?

01:06:08.610 --> 01:06:10.740
This has been studied
a lot, because this

01:06:10.740 --> 01:06:13.210
is one of those
irresistible subjects

01:06:13.210 --> 01:06:15.380
that, ooh, people just
can't get enough of.

01:06:15.380 --> 01:06:16.590
What's up with that?

01:06:16.590 --> 01:06:18.340
What does the literature show?

01:06:18.340 --> 01:06:22.930
A certain degree of heritability
of sexual orientation, and you

01:06:22.930 --> 01:06:25.640
should be able to leap up right
now and say exactly what that

01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:26.870
means and doesn't mean.

01:06:26.870 --> 01:06:28.620
Here's the sort of evidence.

01:06:28.620 --> 01:06:31.500
Twin studies, twin
studies-- when

01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:34.710
you look at monozygotic
twins, identical twins,

01:06:34.710 --> 01:06:38.560
there's approximately
50% concordance

01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:41.060
of sexual orientation.

01:06:41.060 --> 01:06:43.650
Translated into the terms
that people are usually

01:06:43.650 --> 01:06:46.610
focusing on in those
studies, which is to say,

01:06:46.610 --> 01:06:49.060
if somebody is gay,
their identical twins

01:06:49.060 --> 01:06:52.310
has a 50% chance of being gay.

01:06:52.310 --> 01:06:56.760
Dizygotic twins, non-identical
twins-- what is the number?

01:06:56.760 --> 01:07:00.380
Instead it's 22% covariance.

01:07:00.380 --> 01:07:02.990
What's the number
with other siblings?

01:07:02.990 --> 01:07:05.310
9% covariance.

01:07:05.310 --> 01:07:06.640
So what do we see here?

01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:09.030
We see a suggestion
that the more genes you

01:07:09.030 --> 01:07:12.330
have in common with somebody,
but also the more prenatal

01:07:12.330 --> 01:07:15.630
environment you had with
your non-identical twin, all

01:07:15.630 --> 01:07:17.850
of that stuff, the greater
the likelihood of sharing

01:07:17.850 --> 01:07:19.660
a trait of sexual orientation.

01:07:19.660 --> 01:07:23.380
And you can be off and running
right now about the limitations

01:07:23.380 --> 01:07:27.260
of that interpretation,
because obviously, this

01:07:27.260 --> 01:07:29.560
suggests genetic
effects, and it also

01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:33.210
suggests the whole world of
identical twins being treated

01:07:33.210 --> 01:07:36.440
differently than
non-identical ones.

01:07:36.440 --> 01:07:39.240
One additional piece
in that story, and this

01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:43.110
was another one of those front
page stories in Time, Newsweek,

01:07:43.110 --> 01:07:45.070
et cetera, and this
came a couple of years

01:07:45.070 --> 01:07:49.410
after Simon Levey's finding of
that sexually dimorphic nucleus

01:07:49.410 --> 01:07:51.100
in the brain, that
whole deal there.

01:07:51.100 --> 01:07:55.060
And this was the reporting
of the first genetic markers

01:07:55.060 --> 01:07:57.450
for sexual orientation.

01:07:57.450 --> 01:07:59.680
And this was reported
by a geneticist

01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:01.310
at National Institute
of Health, a guy

01:08:01.310 --> 01:08:05.610
named Dean Hamer, who was a
very well-respected geneticist.

01:08:05.610 --> 01:08:11.020
And what he reported was that
he was finding genetic markers

01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:13.410
for sexual orientation.

01:08:13.410 --> 01:08:16.660
In other words, certain
gene locations that

01:08:16.660 --> 01:08:21.069
were more likely to be shared
between gay siblings, where

01:08:21.069 --> 01:08:25.189
both were gay, than
between partially

01:08:25.189 --> 01:08:29.193
gay siblings or non-gay siblings
or however that one runs.

01:08:29.193 --> 01:08:30.720
You know that one by now.

01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:33.334
Beginning to find genetic
markers going with this.

01:08:33.334 --> 01:08:37.149
This was really interesting,
and no surprise--

01:08:37.149 --> 01:08:39.630
what the newspapers were
screaming about within days

01:08:39.630 --> 01:08:41.210
was scientists
announced today they

01:08:41.210 --> 01:08:45.870
have discovered the gay gene.

01:08:45.870 --> 01:08:46.600
Great.

01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:50.040
Maybe we shouldn't let people
learn any science out there.

01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:53.520
So scientists have
discovered the gay gene.

01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:55.840
It goes to all the newspapers
and Reader's Digest,

01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:58.609
and if I recall at the
time, Ronald Reagan as well,

01:08:58.609 --> 01:09:01.099
but he was completely
demented at that point,

01:09:01.099 --> 01:09:02.390
so I won't hold it against him.

01:09:02.390 --> 01:09:04.660
But the people at Newsweek
should have known better.

01:09:04.660 --> 01:09:08.180
So we have cover stories
about the gay gene.

01:09:08.180 --> 01:09:10.880
Obviously, you can rip
this to shreds right now.

01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:13.160
Number one, this was not a gene.

01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:14.770
This was a genetic marker.

01:09:14.770 --> 01:09:18.319
You remember the other
week, the difference there.

01:09:18.319 --> 01:09:23.490
Number two, there was
no consistency in this.

01:09:23.490 --> 01:09:25.085
What do I mean by this?

01:09:25.085 --> 01:09:28.649
This pair of
identical twins would

01:09:28.649 --> 01:09:32.859
tend to share a certain genetic
marker, which was predictive

01:09:32.859 --> 01:09:34.560
of sexual orientation.

01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:39.609
And the next pair over, it
wasn't the same area of genes

01:09:39.609 --> 01:09:41.370
that showed that covariance.

01:09:41.370 --> 01:09:43.149
It would be a completely
different area

01:09:43.149 --> 01:09:44.439
that they had in common.

01:09:44.439 --> 01:09:47.020
In another pair, a
completely different area,

01:09:47.020 --> 01:09:52.189
you got this genetic covariance
in various twin pairs,

01:09:52.189 --> 01:09:55.500
but it wasn't the same gene
marker in all those cases.

01:09:55.500 --> 01:09:57.260
All of them were
different, which

01:09:57.260 --> 01:10:00.250
makes zero sense in
terms of the genetics.

01:10:00.250 --> 01:10:03.370
The biggest problem with it
is that since then, all sorts

01:10:03.370 --> 01:10:05.320
of people have tried to
replicate the finding,

01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:07.110
and it has never
been replicated.

01:10:07.110 --> 01:10:10.610
Nonetheless, Hamer became
quite famous for this.

01:10:10.610 --> 01:10:13.340
He is gay, and he used this
sort of politically some

01:10:13.340 --> 01:10:16.550
of the same ways that Simon
Levey did with his study, which

01:10:16.550 --> 01:10:18.370
is, don't tell me about choice.

01:10:18.370 --> 01:10:21.220
Don't tell me about my
neurotic mother anymore.

01:10:21.220 --> 01:10:25.300
We are looking at a very hard
wired biological trait-- what

01:10:25.300 --> 01:10:27.050
sexual orientation you have.

01:10:27.050 --> 01:10:29.450
Levey's finding I have
found quite convincing

01:10:29.450 --> 01:10:31.010
in terms of replications.

01:10:31.010 --> 01:10:34.910
Hamer's-- nobody else has
replicated any actual genetics

01:10:34.910 --> 01:10:36.010
that he reported.

01:10:36.010 --> 01:10:37.910
Makes no sense at all.

01:10:37.910 --> 01:10:41.730
So great limitations in
what you could make of this.

01:10:41.730 --> 01:10:42.390
OK.

01:10:42.390 --> 01:10:46.040
This allows us to make our
great final leap to the left

01:10:46.040 --> 01:10:47.640
with this thing,
this logic that's

01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:49.950
going to run through
everything we talk about,

01:10:49.950 --> 01:10:52.850
which is the second you're
talking about genes,

01:10:52.850 --> 01:10:57.600
you are implicitly talking
about the evolutionary history

01:10:57.600 --> 01:10:59.910
that brought about the
existence of those genes.

01:10:59.910 --> 01:11:03.480
And that you're also talking
about the proteins made

01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:06.750
by those genes and early
environment changing

01:11:06.750 --> 01:11:10.430
the epigenetic state of
transcribing those genes.

01:11:10.430 --> 01:11:12.320
Yes, yes, that whole
song and dance now.

01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:16.960
So now we have to transition to,
what does evolutionary biology

01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:19.330
tell us about sexual behavior?

01:11:19.330 --> 01:11:22.290
So the first thing that it tells
us is absolutely obvious, which

01:11:22.290 --> 01:11:26.520
is organisms have sex for
the good of the species.

01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:27.900
So that one's out of the way.

01:11:27.900 --> 01:11:31.630
So now we go to what is
much more logically in terms

01:11:31.630 --> 01:11:34.180
of contemporary, evolutionary
thinking-- contemporary

01:11:34.180 --> 01:11:37.450
starting circa 1965 or
so-- the whole notion

01:11:37.450 --> 01:11:40.200
of maximizing the number of
copies of your own genes,

01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:44.230
all of that translated into
sort of the economic terms

01:11:44.230 --> 01:11:45.950
of [INAUDIBLE] copies of genes.

01:11:45.950 --> 01:11:49.090
What that basically
states is sexual behavior

01:11:49.090 --> 01:11:51.660
is about reproduction.

01:11:51.660 --> 01:11:54.640
And people who would
study phenomena

01:11:54.640 --> 01:11:57.050
like these in various
rodent species

01:11:57.050 --> 01:12:00.400
or wildebeest ovulating the
same afternoon, all of that,

01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:04.850
would say, yes, indeed, you
only have sexual behavior

01:12:04.850 --> 01:12:10.230
when it's around the time when
females are ovulating and yes.

01:12:10.230 --> 01:12:12.800
Reproductive behavior
is about reproduction.

01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:14.970
It's about passing
on copies of genes.

01:12:14.970 --> 01:12:19.200
What soon began to fall apart
was not only making sense of us

01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:23.360
with our having non-reproductive
sex all sorts of times,

01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:25.980
was the discovery that we're
not the only species that

01:12:25.980 --> 01:12:26.760
does that.

01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:30.010
And far and away
the flagship species

01:12:30.010 --> 01:12:34.700
as a sort of emblem of
that are bonobo chimps,

01:12:34.700 --> 01:12:38.130
who are, according to almost
all primatologists out there,

01:12:38.130 --> 01:12:40.413
the coolest primate
species there is.

01:12:40.413 --> 01:12:40.913
OK.

01:12:40.913 --> 01:12:42.620
Bonobo chimps-- they
were historically

01:12:42.620 --> 01:12:46.850
known as pygmy chimps, which is
to say that when people first

01:12:46.850 --> 01:12:49.220
discovered them in
terms of scientists,

01:12:49.220 --> 01:12:51.200
they were viewed as,
well, these are chimps,

01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:54.284
but they're just kind of
weirdo atrophied chimps, which

01:12:54.284 --> 01:12:55.700
I don't quite know
how you come up

01:12:55.700 --> 01:12:58.170
with a pygmy atrophied
chimp, but that was the view.

01:12:58.170 --> 01:13:00.680
And not very interesting--
what eventually became clear

01:13:00.680 --> 01:13:03.780
is they are a separate
species of chimp,

01:13:03.780 --> 01:13:06.610
and bonobo chimps
are utterly different

01:13:06.610 --> 01:13:10.510
from your standard issue
Jane Goodall chimps.

01:13:10.510 --> 01:13:14.010
Again, Jane Goodall chimps,
we have a tournament species

01:13:14.010 --> 01:13:17.140
with extreme high levels
of male aggression.

01:13:17.140 --> 01:13:19.260
As we will hear
about next week, you

01:13:19.260 --> 01:13:21.620
have chimps who are
building weapons.

01:13:21.620 --> 01:13:23.630
You have chimps
that form something

01:13:23.630 --> 01:13:26.880
resembling organized
warfare, and meanwhile,

01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:29.840
over, as it turned out, on
the other side of the Congo,

01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:31.930
which is where the
main division occurs,

01:13:31.930 --> 01:13:35.490
you only find bonobos in
one area of the Congo basin,

01:13:35.490 --> 01:13:38.220
and they clearly have been
reproductively isolated

01:13:38.220 --> 01:13:40.400
from all the rest of
the chimps heading there

01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:43.850
east all the way to the Indian
Ocean by way of the Congo.

01:13:43.850 --> 01:13:45.830
There, go on the other
side of the river.

01:13:45.830 --> 01:13:50.530
You've got the bonobos, and
bonobos are totally different.

01:13:50.530 --> 01:13:56.170
Bonobos, unlike chimps, have
virtually no sexual dimorphism,

01:13:56.170 --> 01:13:58.250
so you're off and
running with that one.

01:13:58.250 --> 01:14:00.380
We know exactly what that means.

01:14:00.380 --> 01:14:05.970
Bonobo chimps have female
dominance rather than male.

01:14:05.970 --> 01:14:09.558
All bonobo chimps play the
guitar and sing soulfully.

01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:13.560
What else?

01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:16.740
And we have astonishing
amounts of sex.

01:14:16.740 --> 01:14:17.600
Wait a second.

01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:19.380
We just went off the rails here.

01:14:19.380 --> 01:14:21.960
A species with low degrees
of aggression, because they

01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:24.080
have virtually no aggression
whatsoever, species

01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:27.970
with low degree of aggression
and with no sexual dimorphism

01:14:27.970 --> 01:14:29.760
in body size-- what
we're looking at

01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:32.790
is a pair bonding species,
a monogamous species.

01:14:32.790 --> 01:14:36.110
Bonobos are not a
monogamous species.

01:14:36.110 --> 01:14:40.590
Bonobos make-- I don't know
who-- look like a pair bonding

01:14:40.590 --> 01:14:41.820
species by comparison.

01:14:41.820 --> 01:14:46.050
Bonobos are the most sexually
promiscuous species on Earth.

01:14:46.050 --> 01:14:49.300
Bonobos have astonishing
amounts of sex

01:14:49.300 --> 01:14:52.390
with every other type of
bonobo they could run into.

01:14:52.390 --> 01:14:54.750
They have sex in
order to reproduce.

01:14:54.750 --> 01:14:57.360
They have sex in order
to decrease tensions.

01:14:57.360 --> 01:14:59.010
They have sex in
order to celebrate

01:14:59.010 --> 01:15:00.610
having decreased tensions.

01:15:00.610 --> 01:15:03.290
They have sex, because it's an
even numbered day of the month,

01:15:03.290 --> 01:15:04.420
because this is odd.

01:15:04.420 --> 01:15:07.250
Every variety, and
the vast majority

01:15:07.250 --> 01:15:10.490
of it being non-reproductive,
non-reproductive

01:15:10.490 --> 01:15:14.280
because it's not at a time
when anybody's ovulating,

01:15:14.280 --> 01:15:16.400
or because it's with
someone of the same sex,

01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:19.190
or it involves sexual behavior,
which traditionally does not

01:15:19.190 --> 01:15:21.760
result in eggs getting
fertilized and all sorts

01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:24.162
of variants that
people only dream about

01:15:24.162 --> 01:15:25.620
from buying books
and trying to get

01:15:25.620 --> 01:15:27.120
lessons and this sort of thing.

01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:29.320
And you have, perhaps,
having something

01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:32.520
to do with that astonishingly
limber spinal columns,

01:15:32.520 --> 01:15:34.830
but what you've got is a
totally different picture.

01:15:34.830 --> 01:15:35.760
Wait a second.

01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:38.540
They are very low
aggression, and they

01:15:38.540 --> 01:15:41.110
have no sexual dimorphism,
but they're as far

01:15:41.110 --> 01:15:43.010
from pair bonding
as you can get.

01:15:43.010 --> 01:15:46.080
And instead, you have a highly
promiscuous social system,

01:15:46.080 --> 01:15:47.810
female-dominated,
and they're all

01:15:47.810 --> 01:15:50.490
just so cool and wonderful
you can't believe it.

01:15:50.490 --> 01:15:53.120
And every time people go
to primatology meetings,

01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:56.740
if you study some dumb old
stupid species like a baboon,

01:15:56.740 --> 01:15:58.580
you spend the whole
time basically feeling

01:15:58.580 --> 01:16:00.320
like you're some sort
of immature jerk,

01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:02.390
because you're not
hanging out with bonobos.

01:16:02.390 --> 01:16:05.460
They are the kings of
primatologists these days,

01:16:05.460 --> 01:16:06.830
the people who study bonobos.

01:16:06.830 --> 01:16:10.600
As the soundbite goes,
chimpanzees are from Mars.

01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:13.540
Bonobos are from Venus.

01:16:13.540 --> 01:16:14.110
OK.

01:16:14.110 --> 01:16:17.040
So that's what the t-shirts
say from the bonobo people

01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:18.460
at the conferences there.

01:16:18.460 --> 01:16:19.810
Totally different system.

01:16:19.810 --> 01:16:22.960
So what we already see is
violating our simple rules

01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:25.220
of what predicts a
tournament species

01:16:25.220 --> 01:16:26.850
and what predicts
a pair bonding one.

01:16:26.850 --> 01:16:29.979
What's most striking
here is [INAUDIBLE]

01:16:29.979 --> 01:16:31.520
reproductive behavior
is reproduction

01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:32.970
for passing on
copies of the genes,

01:16:32.970 --> 01:16:34.020
not for the good of the species.

01:16:34.020 --> 01:16:36.145
But we know individual
selection could [INAUDIBLE].

01:16:36.145 --> 01:16:39.430
And here's these guys having
sex with 14 other bonobos

01:16:39.430 --> 01:16:42.140
while they're all upside
down or who knows what,

01:16:42.140 --> 01:16:46.700
and it's not just for passing
on numbers of copies of genes.

01:16:46.700 --> 01:16:49.240
Huge, huge exception there.

01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:52.050
And huge exception in
lots of other species.

01:16:52.050 --> 01:16:54.180
And the ecologist
Joan Roughgarden

01:16:54.180 --> 01:16:56.110
here in the biology
department has

01:16:56.110 --> 01:16:59.860
made an argument there is far
more non-reproductive sex that

01:16:59.860 --> 01:17:01.770
goes on in lots of
different species,

01:17:01.770 --> 01:17:05.470
weakening the classic
Darwinian concept from three,

01:17:05.470 --> 01:17:07.870
four weeks ago of
sexual selection

01:17:07.870 --> 01:17:10.380
being a very important
driving force.

01:17:10.380 --> 01:17:12.992
What sex is very heavily
about is one gender choosing

01:17:12.992 --> 01:17:14.700
who are going to mate
with the other one,

01:17:14.700 --> 01:17:17.200
and it's all driven by
that of seeing instead

01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:19.390
if the world of
bonobos, there's not

01:17:19.390 --> 01:17:23.670
a whole lot of evolutionary
drive being built around sex

01:17:23.670 --> 01:17:25.460
equals reproduction.

01:17:25.460 --> 01:17:27.890
So bonobos are
really interesting.

01:17:27.890 --> 01:17:30.030
What's the sex there about?

01:17:30.030 --> 01:17:31.880
One of the common themes
that comes through

01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:35.140
is it's about promoting
group cohesion,

01:17:35.140 --> 01:17:38.360
and one of the things that
people emphasize or focus on

01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:42.120
with bonobos is you look at all
sorts of other primate species,

01:17:42.120 --> 01:17:44.870
and what do they do when
they're upset about something?

01:17:44.870 --> 01:17:45.942
They groom each other.

01:17:45.942 --> 01:17:47.400
What do they do
when they're happy?

01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:48.090
They groom.

01:17:48.090 --> 01:17:49.860
What do they do--
social grooming,

01:17:49.860 --> 01:17:54.440
as termed the social glue, the
social lubricant of a society.

01:17:54.440 --> 01:17:56.210
You get a troop of
baboons that have just

01:17:56.210 --> 01:17:58.710
gotten a bad scare from
a lion, and as soon

01:17:58.710 --> 01:18:00.950
as the coast is clear,
everybody comes down

01:18:00.950 --> 01:18:03.500
and spends the next 30
minutes grooming each other.

01:18:03.500 --> 01:18:06.680
And sexual behavior
in bonobos appears

01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:09.020
to be serving a
very similar role--

01:18:09.020 --> 01:18:13.010
all about social cohesion
as well as decreasing

01:18:13.010 --> 01:18:15.470
individual tensions,
reconciliation,

01:18:15.470 --> 01:18:17.490
things of that sort.

01:18:17.490 --> 01:18:21.540
Now this flies on the face of a
dominant theory that was around

01:18:21.540 --> 01:18:23.570
in the last century,
the first part of it,

01:18:23.570 --> 01:18:26.040
and this was due to one
of the grand poobahs

01:18:26.040 --> 01:18:29.840
in this field, a guy, this
Brit named Solly Zuckerman.

01:18:29.840 --> 01:18:33.200
Solly Zuckerman, who eventually
became Sir Solly Zuckerman,

01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:35.290
which probably didn't
help him in society at all

01:18:35.290 --> 01:18:38.400
still despite that,
but old Zuckerman there

01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:42.110
was, for his time, the
embarrassed Wynne Edwards.

01:18:42.110 --> 01:18:43.860
He was the Lamarck
of the earliest

01:18:43.860 --> 01:18:45.290
part of the 20th century.

01:18:45.290 --> 01:18:47.240
The people who will
only be remembered

01:18:47.240 --> 01:18:49.850
for coming up with
Lamarckianism, old Lamarck

01:18:49.850 --> 01:18:52.710
or coming up with something
as idiotic as group selection.

01:18:52.710 --> 01:18:55.450
What Zuckerman came
up with was the notion

01:18:55.450 --> 01:19:00.690
that sexual behavior is purely
for promoting group cohesion

01:19:00.690 --> 01:19:02.890
and for decreasing violence.

01:19:02.890 --> 01:19:06.080
And all you need to do is go
to half the movies out there

01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:08.160
or study half the
species on Earth,

01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:11.890
and what you will see is
sexual behavior or inability of

01:19:11.890 --> 01:19:15.030
or unrequited or
whatever vanquished

01:19:15.030 --> 01:19:19.130
is the cause of the majority
of aggression in organisms

01:19:19.130 --> 01:19:22.670
out there in various
mammals, and that argues

01:19:22.670 --> 01:19:24.600
very strongly against it.

01:19:24.600 --> 01:19:28.020
So what you see in most species
that have been studied--

01:19:28.020 --> 01:19:31.280
it's a strong argument
against the Zuckerman stance.

01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:34.590
Nonetheless, you see in
some species like bonobos

01:19:34.590 --> 01:19:37.290
and Roughgarden's
argument, lots more species

01:19:37.290 --> 01:19:39.020
than people traditionally
would think,

01:19:39.020 --> 01:19:42.830
where instead you see sexual
behavior often serving

01:19:42.830 --> 01:19:47.800
a non-reproductive group
cohesion sort of role.

01:19:47.800 --> 01:19:51.620
What else does evolution have to
tell us about sexual behavior?

01:19:51.620 --> 01:19:53.930
One critical issue and
one that was touched

01:19:53.930 --> 01:19:56.510
on the first couple of
lectures is, what does it

01:19:56.510 --> 01:19:58.560
cost you to reproduce?

01:19:58.560 --> 01:20:02.740
And there we get the
hugely important asymmetry,

01:20:02.740 --> 01:20:06.620
which is sperm don't cost
a whole lot, whereas eggs

01:20:06.620 --> 01:20:10.620
and pregnancy and postnatal
care and all of that

01:20:10.620 --> 01:20:12.000
is hugely expensive.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.200
What is that the
driving force on

01:20:14.200 --> 01:20:16.770
according to all the
sociobiological thinking?

01:20:16.770 --> 01:20:19.420
The fact that in species
after species after species,

01:20:19.420 --> 01:20:22.000
females are more
selective about who

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.700
they will mate with than
males, and it's usually

01:20:24.700 --> 01:20:27.870
the case the males are not
selective in the slightest.

01:20:27.870 --> 01:20:29.690
And what you've
got instead is just

01:20:29.690 --> 01:20:32.550
a couple of sperm that accost
you, and that's not a big deal.

01:20:32.550 --> 01:20:36.790
Increased female selectivity,
higher levels of it than males,

01:20:36.790 --> 01:20:39.840
argument being that it is
all about the differential

01:20:39.840 --> 01:20:42.410
costs of pregnancy.

01:20:42.410 --> 01:20:45.070
What we also saw was
not of pregnancy,

01:20:45.070 --> 01:20:47.540
but of reproduction
and raising of kids.

01:20:47.540 --> 01:20:49.420
What we saw was the
interesting realm

01:20:49.420 --> 01:20:51.500
where you got the
exception to that, which

01:20:51.500 --> 01:20:53.670
were the pair bonding species.

01:20:53.670 --> 01:20:56.560
The marmosets, for example,
and what we saw back

01:20:56.560 --> 01:21:00.910
when was the male does as
much child care as the female

01:21:00.910 --> 01:21:03.650
does, and the
females always twin.

01:21:03.650 --> 01:21:06.030
So around the time
that the kids are born,

01:21:06.030 --> 01:21:08.890
the female has put in far
more of the investment.

01:21:08.890 --> 01:21:10.790
She's gone through
the pregnancy in terms

01:21:10.790 --> 01:21:12.320
of caloric expenditure.

01:21:12.320 --> 01:21:15.770
The males do, if anything,
more of the child rearing

01:21:15.770 --> 01:21:18.090
in terms of carrying the
kid around when foraging,

01:21:18.090 --> 01:21:21.220
all sorts of costly stuff
like that, and eventually,

01:21:21.220 --> 01:21:27.630
what you see is the
curves don't do that.

01:21:27.630 --> 01:21:29.640
But at some point,
the cumulative amount

01:21:29.640 --> 01:21:31.830
of calories that the
male has expended

01:21:31.830 --> 01:21:33.450
is greater than the female.

01:21:33.450 --> 01:21:36.240
That's when you see
that cuckoldry business.

01:21:36.240 --> 01:21:38.510
That's where females
will potentially

01:21:38.510 --> 01:21:42.120
pick up and abandon, and because
the male has made the greater

01:21:42.120 --> 01:21:45.430
investment at that point, that
is seen very frequently in bird

01:21:45.430 --> 01:21:47.250
species with pair bonding.

01:21:47.250 --> 01:21:49.850
So we've got here an
exception to the argument

01:21:49.850 --> 01:21:53.230
that the cost of reproduction
and child raising

01:21:53.230 --> 01:21:55.490
is always greater for females
and, thus, will always

01:21:55.490 --> 01:21:58.530
produce greater female
pickiness for mates

01:21:58.530 --> 01:21:59.850
than you find in males.

01:21:59.850 --> 01:22:03.840
Nonetheless, you see
that an awful lot.

01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:05.170
What else do you see?

01:22:05.170 --> 01:22:07.590
A whole world not only
of female pickiness,

01:22:07.590 --> 01:22:10.000
but a whole world
of male attempts

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.940
to control female
reproductive behavior.

01:22:12.940 --> 01:22:16.100
And this found in species
after species after species

01:22:16.100 --> 01:22:18.420
an obvious interpretation
there in terms

01:22:18.420 --> 01:22:21.370
of male-male
competition decreasing

01:22:21.370 --> 01:22:24.550
the ability of females to
mate with someone else.

01:22:24.550 --> 01:22:27.570
And that ranges
from primates who

01:22:27.570 --> 01:22:31.230
are in consortships, where
the male will do what is often

01:22:31.230 --> 01:22:33.910
termed mate guarding,
which is he tries

01:22:33.910 --> 01:22:36.390
to keep the female from
going near any other guy

01:22:36.390 --> 01:22:38.720
to all sorts of
other stuff as well.

01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:41.030
And you certainly see
this in the human realm.

01:22:41.030 --> 01:22:44.610
What are two cultural inventions
humans have come up with

01:22:44.610 --> 01:22:48.970
to decrease the likelihood--
by men-- to decrease

01:22:48.970 --> 01:22:51.580
the likelihood of women
being sexually active

01:22:51.580 --> 01:22:53.520
outside that relationship?

01:22:53.520 --> 01:22:55.770
The first one is
clitoridectomies,

01:22:55.770 --> 01:22:59.120
and something else that serves
a very similar function, which

01:22:59.120 --> 01:23:02.350
is inventions of things
like chastity belts.

01:23:02.350 --> 01:23:03.950
What's up with that?

01:23:03.950 --> 01:23:06.230
What you find are
cultural inventions

01:23:06.230 --> 01:23:10.490
like those in groups that tend
to have occupations where males

01:23:10.490 --> 01:23:12.560
disappear for long periods.

01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:14.980
For example, nomadic
pastoralists,

01:23:14.980 --> 01:23:16.800
where depending on
the time of year,

01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:19.800
you pick up with your camels
or your cows or whatever,

01:23:19.800 --> 01:23:22.150
and you, the guy, are going
to spend the next three

01:23:22.150 --> 01:23:24.930
weeks at the grazing area
that's a good five miles

01:23:24.930 --> 01:23:25.890
west of there.

01:23:25.890 --> 01:23:29.150
And what this is about--
the argument culturally

01:23:29.150 --> 01:23:32.640
for the clitoridectomies is
it decreases female pleasure,

01:23:32.640 --> 01:23:35.990
decreases the likelihood of
her having sex with someone

01:23:35.990 --> 01:23:37.430
else when you were elsewhere.

01:23:37.430 --> 01:23:39.940
What were chastity
belts about when

01:23:39.940 --> 01:23:43.100
the guy picked up and decided to
spend the next six years trying

01:23:43.100 --> 01:23:45.780
to liberate Jerusalem
from the Ottomans

01:23:45.780 --> 01:23:47.640
or whatever off in the Crusades?

01:23:47.640 --> 01:23:51.280
And just so you don't have any
ideas over the next half decade

01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:54.500
while I go die from the plague
somewhere in Eastern Europe,

01:23:54.500 --> 01:23:58.090
that's when those were,
again, a model of cultures

01:23:58.090 --> 01:24:00.040
where there were
extended periods

01:24:00.040 --> 01:24:02.950
of men being away from women.

01:24:02.950 --> 01:24:06.450
You have very often
elaborate cultural inventions

01:24:06.450 --> 01:24:10.030
for men trying to control the
reproductive access of women.

01:24:10.030 --> 01:24:13.030
What that also winds
up doing is explaining

01:24:13.030 --> 01:24:15.740
what was thought to
be the dominant models

01:24:15.740 --> 01:24:18.670
of reproductive success
and reproductive choice

01:24:18.670 --> 01:24:20.370
in all sorts of other species.

01:24:20.370 --> 01:24:22.190
And seen, for
example, in something

01:24:22.190 --> 01:24:26.080
like baboons, what you had
was termed the linear access

01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:27.990
model of reproduction.

01:24:27.990 --> 01:24:29.770
It goes as follows.

01:24:29.770 --> 01:24:31.850
You have a social
group-- for example,

01:24:31.850 --> 01:24:33.410
a baboon social
group-- and there

01:24:33.410 --> 01:24:37.440
is only one female who is in
estrus, only one female who

01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:38.440
is ovulating.

01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:40.210
Who winds up mating with her?

01:24:40.210 --> 01:24:42.580
The alpha male in the troop.

01:24:42.580 --> 01:24:45.920
Now instead, there's two
females who were ovulating.

01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:47.780
Who gets the two females?

01:24:47.780 --> 01:24:49.860
Numbers one and two
in the hierarchy.

01:24:49.860 --> 01:24:53.130
Three females-- numbers one,
two, and three get the female.

01:24:53.130 --> 01:24:56.810
And implicit in that is the
activeness implied in the word

01:24:56.810 --> 01:24:59.250
"get," the passive
lack of choice

01:24:59.250 --> 01:25:00.520
at the female end of things.

01:25:00.520 --> 01:25:03.680
This was the linear access
model in which male dominance

01:25:03.680 --> 01:25:07.780
rank was entirely predictive
of male reproductive success.

01:25:07.780 --> 01:25:10.460
So that's what people
thought lots about then.

01:25:10.460 --> 01:25:13.140
That was the original thinking
about the relationship

01:25:13.140 --> 01:25:16.000
between male dominance rank
and reproductive success.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:20.020
As we will see shortly,
it's not quite so clear.

01:25:20.020 --> 01:25:24.210
Lots of other species, where
you see males attempting

01:25:24.210 --> 01:25:26.130
in the evolutionary
sense, attempting

01:25:26.130 --> 01:25:28.840
to limit female access
to other males--

01:25:28.840 --> 01:25:32.210
this is the whole world
of copulatory plugs.

01:25:32.210 --> 01:25:36.940
Lots of dog canine related
species, where a semen plug is

01:25:36.940 --> 01:25:39.280
left there in the vagina
of the female, which

01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:43.720
soon hardens into a
plug like nothing else

01:25:43.720 --> 01:25:44.920
is happening there.

01:25:44.920 --> 01:25:46.220
You see that.

01:25:46.220 --> 01:25:47.610
There are other cases.

01:25:47.610 --> 01:25:51.780
There are fly species where
the males penis is barbed,

01:25:51.780 --> 01:25:59.261
and ooh, I heard a--
I'm not drawing that.

01:25:59.261 --> 01:26:01.370
What are you thinking?

01:26:01.370 --> 01:26:03.570
Where it's barbed and
where the barbs, in fact,

01:26:03.570 --> 01:26:07.820
go in the opposite direction,
point back at the male.

01:26:07.820 --> 01:26:11.930
Once you get the penis in there,
and it's not coming out again.

01:26:11.930 --> 01:26:15.200
It's like one of
those-- you put your--

01:26:15.200 --> 01:26:17.160
[LAUGHTER]

01:26:17.160 --> 01:26:19.390
Well, it's actually
not like one of those,

01:26:19.390 --> 01:26:20.710
but you get the point.

01:26:20.710 --> 01:26:22.110
And what's that about?

01:26:22.110 --> 01:26:24.800
The male leaves
his penis in there,

01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:27.220
which he manages to
do without afterward,

01:26:27.220 --> 01:26:29.050
because they can make new ones.

01:26:29.050 --> 01:26:31.590
And this is a very different
world you've got here.

01:26:31.590 --> 01:26:34.750
Then you've got the whole world
we've already heard about about

01:26:34.750 --> 01:26:39.490
sperm competition, of sperm from
one male in various fly species

01:26:39.490 --> 01:26:43.100
containing toxins that will
kill the sperm of another male.

01:26:43.100 --> 01:26:45.720
Then there's a whole
interesting world

01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:50.260
that goes on, which is when
males mate with a female,

01:26:50.260 --> 01:26:52.730
they do something
biochemically, which

01:26:52.730 --> 01:26:55.320
decreases the sexual
attractiveness

01:26:55.320 --> 01:26:57.470
of the female
subsequent to that.

01:26:57.470 --> 01:27:00.330
In a number of fly
species, males with mating

01:27:00.330 --> 01:27:03.920
release a chemical, which
decreases mating pheromone

01:27:03.920 --> 01:27:05.440
production in the female.

01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:08.650
And suddenly, nobody else
is interested in her,

01:27:08.650 --> 01:27:11.180
or there are other
flies species where

01:27:11.180 --> 01:27:14.950
males release a chemical, which
decreases sexual proceptivity

01:27:14.950 --> 01:27:15.980
in the female.

01:27:15.980 --> 01:27:19.550
Viciously clever ways
for males to control

01:27:19.550 --> 01:27:22.580
female reproductive
behavior after they've left.

01:27:22.580 --> 01:27:25.660
Male-male competitive
strategies.

01:27:25.660 --> 01:27:28.000
So what do you see at
the female end of things?

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:31.380
No surprise, you see
female counterstrategies.

01:27:31.380 --> 01:27:34.450
One brilliant one
that evolved in humans

01:27:34.450 --> 01:27:39.480
is this relatively unique human
phenomenon of hidden ovulation.

01:27:39.480 --> 01:27:42.380
Yes, all that pheromone
stuff and smelling people's

01:27:42.380 --> 01:27:45.280
armpits and things that don't
happen much in the real world,

01:27:45.280 --> 01:27:48.510
but what you see for the most
part is that humans are not

01:27:48.510 --> 01:27:51.400
terribly aware of where
somebody is in their cycle.

01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:54.560
Humans have invented
hidden ovulation.

01:27:54.560 --> 01:27:56.380
What's that meant to do?

01:27:56.380 --> 01:27:59.410
Decrease paternity certainty.

01:27:59.410 --> 01:28:02.250
And one argument is
that's a good mechanism

01:28:02.250 --> 01:28:05.590
for decreasing the likelihood
of competitive infanticide.

01:28:05.590 --> 01:28:08.420
The other is it
decreases male attempt

01:28:08.420 --> 01:28:10.620
to control female
sexual behavior,

01:28:10.620 --> 01:28:14.060
because it's less clear when
you need to be doing that.

01:28:14.060 --> 01:28:15.640
So counterstrategies.

01:28:15.640 --> 01:28:19.560
More examples-- this is argued
that in some species that

01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:22.310
have non-reproductive sex
throughout the cycle, that

01:28:22.310 --> 01:28:26.160
is a female counterstrategy
to, again, fool the male when

01:28:26.160 --> 01:28:29.730
ovulation is actually occurring,
increasing the likelihood that

01:28:29.730 --> 01:28:32.680
at such times, she can
get somebody else's genes.

01:28:32.680 --> 01:28:36.300
Other strategies-- we've already
heard about one-- [INAUDIBLE]

01:28:36.300 --> 01:28:38.430
in the competitive
infanticide one, which

01:28:38.430 --> 01:28:42.820
is that whole world of females
that can fake being in estrus,

01:28:42.820 --> 01:28:45.590
that go through pseudo
estrus, all of this

01:28:45.590 --> 01:28:49.390
meant to be ways of keeping
males a little bit less certain

01:28:49.390 --> 01:28:53.320
of when they should be trying
to control female sexual access,

01:28:53.320 --> 01:28:56.800
and thus, she has more
choice in the matter.

01:28:56.800 --> 01:29:00.820
What that brings
us to is thus-- oh,

01:29:00.820 --> 01:29:02.730
that's something
interesting that I left out.

01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:07.450
Eh, it's not that interesting.

01:29:07.450 --> 01:29:08.580
OK.

01:29:08.580 --> 01:29:10.870
So back to male-male
competition.

01:29:10.870 --> 01:29:13.920
This was first looking at
male in lots of species,

01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:17.010
male attempts to regulate
female sexual behavior,

01:29:17.010 --> 01:29:18.680
female counterstrategies.

01:29:18.680 --> 01:29:20.780
What's up with
male-male competition

01:29:20.780 --> 01:29:23.000
in terms of evolution
and sexual behavior?

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:26.190
Most obvious one being
is male-male competition

01:29:26.190 --> 01:29:29.130
for reproductive access
and the standard old models

01:29:29.130 --> 01:29:32.170
being that linear access model--
one female winds up with number

01:29:32.170 --> 01:29:34.300
one male, two, and so on.

01:29:34.300 --> 01:29:36.470
What that thus
begins to explain is

01:29:36.470 --> 01:29:39.620
when you look at all
social species out there,

01:29:39.620 --> 01:29:42.660
the leading cause of aggression
is male-male aggression

01:29:42.660 --> 01:29:44.540
built around female access.

01:29:44.540 --> 01:29:46.320
And as we'll see
by next week, that

01:29:46.320 --> 01:29:50.060
is the case as well for every
human culture ever looked at.

01:29:50.060 --> 01:29:53.400
You also see, of course,
the sperm competition.

01:29:53.400 --> 01:29:55.580
And once again, we have
one of those issues

01:29:55.580 --> 01:29:59.330
with humans, which is where do
we fit on the spectrum there?

01:29:59.330 --> 01:30:02.360
If you have a
monogamous species,

01:30:02.360 --> 01:30:06.010
males tend to produce only
small amounts of sperm

01:30:06.010 --> 01:30:07.840
and tend to have small testes.

01:30:07.840 --> 01:30:09.800
When you have
polygamous species,

01:30:09.800 --> 01:30:12.790
males want to pump out
insane amounts of sperm

01:30:12.790 --> 01:30:15.890
to increase the likelihood of
outcompeting some other guy's

01:30:15.890 --> 01:30:17.790
sperm if it shows
up on the scene

01:30:17.790 --> 01:30:22.270
or for making a sperm plug, and
what you wind up getting there

01:30:22.270 --> 01:30:24.670
in those species
are large testes.

01:30:24.670 --> 01:30:26.220
So you look at the
various primates,

01:30:26.220 --> 01:30:29.700
and chimps have gigantic
testicles per body size.

01:30:29.700 --> 01:30:30.822
Gorillas do not.

01:30:30.822 --> 01:30:32.530
Gorillas that have a
very different world

01:30:32.530 --> 01:30:34.900
of male-male com--
what about humans?

01:30:34.900 --> 01:30:37.190
Once again, the
same exact thing.

01:30:37.190 --> 01:30:39.480
We are about halfway in between.

01:30:39.480 --> 01:30:41.650
When compared to
other primates, we

01:30:41.650 --> 01:30:44.340
are intermediate between a
tournament species and a pair

01:30:44.340 --> 01:30:47.210
bonding species in
yet another domain.

01:30:47.210 --> 01:30:50.120
We've been hearing about
this again and again.

01:30:50.120 --> 01:30:52.080
Something really
interesting that has

01:30:52.080 --> 01:30:56.770
been shown in humans, which is--
no, I'm not going to tell that.

01:30:56.770 --> 01:30:58.160
That's too hard to explain.

01:30:58.160 --> 01:30:59.220
But it was great.

01:30:59.220 --> 01:31:03.120
You would really wish-- so
now what we have is also

01:31:03.120 --> 01:31:07.610
looking at evolutionary aspects
of female choice in there,

01:31:07.610 --> 01:31:11.660
and in what cases do you get
female-female competition?

01:31:11.660 --> 01:31:14.200
First off, the answer
was obvious in terms

01:31:14.200 --> 01:31:16.980
of looking at traditional
tournament species, which

01:31:16.980 --> 01:31:19.610
is that females have no choice
who they are mating with.

01:31:19.610 --> 01:31:21.550
It's linear access models.

01:31:21.550 --> 01:31:24.160
One female winds up with
the alpha male, two females

01:31:24.160 --> 01:31:26.870
and so on, and this
was the dominant model

01:31:26.870 --> 01:31:30.320
in all of primatology
starting in the '60s.

01:31:30.320 --> 01:31:33.240
And then by around
1980 or so, it

01:31:33.240 --> 01:31:34.960
was recognized that,
in fact, there's

01:31:34.960 --> 01:31:37.810
virtually no evidence
for strict linear access

01:31:37.810 --> 01:31:42.690
models of the main determinant
of who a female mates with is

01:31:42.690 --> 01:31:45.860
who's the winner of male-male
competitive interactions.

01:31:45.860 --> 01:31:48.840
People discovered at the
time that, in fact, there

01:31:48.840 --> 01:31:53.111
was this strange, strange
violation of all these models,

01:31:53.111 --> 01:31:55.610
because it turned out the models
were not based on behavior.

01:31:55.610 --> 01:31:58.220
And this generally was
discovered around that time,

01:31:58.220 --> 01:32:00.420
because that was around
the time that the majority

01:32:00.420 --> 01:32:02.530
of primatologists on
earth suddenly became

01:32:02.530 --> 01:32:05.940
female and started looking
at the female end of things

01:32:05.940 --> 01:32:09.550
and discovered that this
linear access stuff is not,

01:32:09.550 --> 01:32:11.200
in fact, what occurs.

01:32:11.200 --> 01:32:15.630
And out of that came a
completely shocking concept

01:32:15.630 --> 01:32:19.520
that ran through primatology
like a bolt of lightning--

01:32:19.520 --> 01:32:22.300
the notion that there was--
this is the technical term--

01:32:22.300 --> 01:32:25.520
some degree of female choice.

01:32:25.520 --> 01:32:27.470
Oh, whoa.

01:32:27.470 --> 01:32:31.880
That's kind of bizarre,
where females have something

01:32:31.880 --> 01:32:33.220
to do with who they mate with.

01:32:33.220 --> 01:32:35.800
And there's been a whole
world of primatology studies

01:32:35.800 --> 01:32:39.140
since then showing what
female choice is about.

01:32:39.140 --> 01:32:41.700
First off, how
does female choice

01:32:41.700 --> 01:32:44.920
occur in a typical
tournament species?

01:32:44.920 --> 01:32:46.190
You've got this problem.

01:32:46.190 --> 01:32:49.710
With primates, for example,
you wind up with a pair bond,

01:32:49.710 --> 01:32:53.380
with a consortship between a
male and an ovulating female,

01:32:53.380 --> 01:32:55.330
and because it's a
tournament species,

01:32:55.330 --> 01:32:57.850
the male is twice
the size or has

01:32:57.850 --> 01:33:01.570
big huge canines or whatever
stuff he's got there.

01:33:01.570 --> 01:33:04.080
He is physically able
to dominate the female

01:33:04.080 --> 01:33:05.190
quite readily.

01:33:05.190 --> 01:33:08.830
You do not see female choice
in those cases being exerted

01:33:08.830 --> 01:33:10.590
by the female
beating up on the guy

01:33:10.590 --> 01:33:13.050
and her getting to go mate
with who she's interested in.

01:33:13.050 --> 01:33:16.290
What you see is much
more clever behavior

01:33:16.290 --> 01:33:17.900
on the part of the female.

01:33:17.900 --> 01:33:21.120
She will, for example,
exhaust the guy.

01:33:21.120 --> 01:33:23.670
Every time he sits down
to feed, the female

01:33:23.670 --> 01:33:25.060
gets up and starts walking.

01:33:25.060 --> 01:33:28.449
And he has to jump up and
pile together the picnic

01:33:28.449 --> 01:33:29.490
and go running after her.

01:33:29.490 --> 01:33:32.180
Every time he tries to take
a nap, she goes walking.

01:33:32.180 --> 01:33:35.420
Or what you find with baboons
is the most clever thing

01:33:35.420 --> 01:33:39.480
that females do is they go
walk and leave the male right

01:33:39.480 --> 01:33:42.410
in front of his
worst rival, or then

01:33:42.410 --> 01:33:44.480
they'll do it again
and again and again

01:33:44.480 --> 01:33:47.040
and get the guy totally
harried out and crazed,

01:33:47.040 --> 01:33:49.850
and at some point, those
two males will have a fight.

01:33:49.850 --> 01:33:52.750
And what then happens is
she runs off to the bushes

01:33:52.750 --> 01:33:54.430
and has what is
technically called

01:33:54.430 --> 01:33:58.555
a stolen copulation with the guy
she's actually interested in.

01:34:01.060 --> 01:34:04.060
Maybe it's not so bad
to be a female baboon.

01:34:04.060 --> 01:34:06.510
So now what this
brings us to insofar

01:34:06.510 --> 01:34:10.140
as this alternative female
strategy is available,

01:34:10.140 --> 01:34:13.380
we now come to this
absolutely critical question,

01:34:13.380 --> 01:34:15.590
one that is run through
the ages, which is,

01:34:15.590 --> 01:34:18.300
what do female baboons want?

01:34:18.300 --> 01:34:19.850
Who do they want to mate with?

01:34:19.850 --> 01:34:23.260
And people are not
positive, but there

01:34:23.260 --> 01:34:25.690
is some suggestion in the data.

01:34:25.690 --> 01:34:27.500
It needs to be replicated more.

01:34:27.500 --> 01:34:30.360
There is this trend, but
there's this suggestion

01:34:30.360 --> 01:34:34.420
that female baboons like to
mate with male baboons, who

01:34:34.420 --> 01:34:36.680
are nice to them.

01:34:36.680 --> 01:34:38.130
No, are they sure?

01:34:38.130 --> 01:34:38.900
Are they certain?

01:34:38.900 --> 01:34:41.180
Have they done their
statistics right?

01:34:41.180 --> 01:34:45.480
They go, and they mate with
guys who groom them a lot,

01:34:45.480 --> 01:34:47.430
guys who play with
their infants,

01:34:47.430 --> 01:34:50.060
guys who, when they're in a
bad mood, don't beat up on them

01:34:50.060 --> 01:34:51.570
but beat up on somebody else.

01:34:51.570 --> 01:34:54.200
This counts as a prince
of the male baboon.

01:34:54.200 --> 01:34:56.170
This is someone you
take home to meet mom.

01:34:56.170 --> 01:34:59.280
When he's in a bad mood, he
pummels someone else, not me.

01:34:59.280 --> 01:35:02.040
This is someone you
want to mate with.

01:35:02.040 --> 01:35:05.710
And in the mid 1980s, excellent
primatologist Barbara Smuts

01:35:05.710 --> 01:35:07.550
of University of
Michigan came up

01:35:07.550 --> 01:35:10.130
with the very jargony
scientific term

01:35:10.130 --> 01:35:11.900
that all sorts of
non-human primates

01:35:11.900 --> 01:35:14.110
have intersexual friendships.

01:35:14.110 --> 01:35:17.240
And that's not an
anthropomorphic term.

01:35:17.240 --> 01:35:19.050
What it was though
was people sort

01:35:19.050 --> 01:35:21.840
of snickering at it in
that the initial notion was

01:35:21.840 --> 01:35:23.720
that these were just friends.

01:35:23.720 --> 01:35:26.290
These were platonic
monkey relationships.

01:35:26.290 --> 01:35:27.930
They were not
about reproduction,

01:35:27.930 --> 01:35:30.880
and it was not until people
got good enough and enough data

01:35:30.880 --> 01:35:33.640
to start picking up on all
those stolen copulations

01:35:33.640 --> 01:35:35.860
to see that the
females were picking up

01:35:35.860 --> 01:35:38.907
and mating with their nice
guy-- oh, we're just friends.

01:35:38.907 --> 01:35:40.990
I could never see him--
whoa, and they're suddenly

01:35:40.990 --> 01:35:42.140
in the bushes with him.

01:35:42.140 --> 01:35:46.067
And it suddenly turned from the,
yeah, nice guys finish last.

01:35:46.067 --> 01:35:48.400
OK, they do lots of grooming,
but let's count the number

01:35:48.400 --> 01:35:50.800
of copies of genes,
to becoming apparent

01:35:50.800 --> 01:35:55.540
that the being a nice guy was a
viable alternative reproductive

01:35:55.540 --> 01:35:59.390
strategy as long as there was
this thing of female choice.

01:35:59.390 --> 01:36:01.770
And what the paternity
studies began to show

01:36:01.770 --> 01:36:05.970
was that was a very viable
alternative strategy, in part,

01:36:05.970 --> 01:36:07.950
because you're not
mating anywhere near as

01:36:07.950 --> 01:36:11.300
much if you were a low
ranking affiliative male.

01:36:11.300 --> 01:36:14.320
With a female, you're not
mating anywhere near as much

01:36:14.320 --> 01:36:17.860
as the high ranking males,
but you're not burning out.

01:36:17.860 --> 01:36:19.030
You're not getting injured.

01:36:19.030 --> 01:36:20.970
You're not having the
male-male fighting.

01:36:20.970 --> 01:36:24.900
You live a lot longer,
and this keeps happening.

01:36:24.900 --> 01:36:27.260
There's a problem,
though, which is

01:36:27.260 --> 01:36:30.410
suppose you are a
female baboon, and you

01:36:30.410 --> 01:36:32.284
want to mate with
this nice guy, and one

01:36:32.284 --> 01:36:33.700
of the things that
he's nice about

01:36:33.700 --> 01:36:35.340
is he's nice to
your kid, who's now

01:36:35.340 --> 01:36:37.380
about three or four years old.

01:36:37.380 --> 01:36:39.137
And there's a very
good chance that where

01:36:39.137 --> 01:36:41.000
that affiliative
relationship started

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.640
with him got jump started was
the fact that he was the most

01:36:43.640 --> 01:36:47.170
likely father of that kid
and has developed somewhat

01:36:47.170 --> 01:36:48.972
of an affiliative
relationship with the kid

01:36:48.972 --> 01:36:50.930
and hangs out with them
and hangs out with you.

01:36:50.930 --> 01:36:52.490
And so you've
established this is

01:36:52.490 --> 01:36:54.270
a nice guy I want to mate with.

01:36:54.270 --> 01:36:56.660
But there's a problem,
which was if he

01:36:56.660 --> 01:36:58.410
was the likely
father of your now

01:36:58.410 --> 01:37:00.900
three, four-year-old
offspring, the odds

01:37:00.900 --> 01:37:02.830
are that three,
four years ago, he

01:37:02.830 --> 01:37:05.440
was a pretty high ranking male.

01:37:05.440 --> 01:37:07.750
And what that means now
three, four years later

01:37:07.750 --> 01:37:11.890
is he's likely to be some
aging guy over the hill, whose

01:37:11.890 --> 01:37:13.600
rank has been dropping.

01:37:13.600 --> 01:37:15.690
In other words,
not someone who is

01:37:15.690 --> 01:37:18.640
going to be very effective
at male-male competition,

01:37:18.640 --> 01:37:21.920
and you get this
horrible sort of tension

01:37:21.920 --> 01:37:25.140
there going on between the
male-male competitive world

01:37:25.140 --> 01:37:28.204
generates some Arnold
Schwarzenegger jerk,

01:37:28.204 --> 01:37:30.620
who's the one who's supposed
to be where she wants to mate

01:37:30.620 --> 01:37:32.650
with Alan Alda or whoever.

01:37:32.650 --> 01:37:35.080
And what you have
then is he's not

01:37:35.080 --> 01:37:37.210
up to the male-male
competitive stuff,

01:37:37.210 --> 01:37:38.940
because he's some aging guy.

01:37:38.940 --> 01:37:43.410
And you instead have the
world of stolen copulations.

01:37:43.410 --> 01:37:44.790
So isn't that great?

01:37:44.790 --> 01:37:45.990
Isn't that heartwarming?

01:37:45.990 --> 01:37:49.850
A whole world of what are now
called alternative strategies.

01:37:49.850 --> 01:37:52.780
If you're some scheming
male baboon wanting

01:37:52.780 --> 01:37:55.000
to pass on as many
copies of your genes,

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.560
you may decide the
really manipulative thing

01:37:57.560 --> 01:37:59.990
to do is to be
nice to some female

01:37:59.990 --> 01:38:02.780
and groom her more
than she grooms

01:38:02.780 --> 01:38:05.780
you, which is a very rare
thing for a male baboon to do.

01:38:05.780 --> 01:38:10.250
So great alternative
strategies, very heartwarming.

01:38:10.250 --> 01:38:12.910
Not so heartwarming,
because there

01:38:12.910 --> 01:38:17.370
are other alternative strategies
available in some species,

01:38:17.370 --> 01:38:21.010
alternatives where male
sexual behavior is not

01:38:21.010 --> 01:38:24.130
the outcome of explicit
male-male competition,

01:38:24.130 --> 01:38:26.680
but instead takes an
alternative strategy.

01:38:26.680 --> 01:38:30.940
And you see one example
of this in orangutans.

01:38:30.940 --> 01:38:33.460
Orangutans, great
apes, and they've

01:38:33.460 --> 01:38:36.710
got a very interesting bizarre
social system, but what

01:38:36.710 --> 01:38:39.920
you have is your basic,
nonetheless, sort of familiar

01:38:39.920 --> 01:38:43.870
picture of male-male competition
with a large percentage

01:38:43.870 --> 01:38:45.680
of orangutan male
aggressions built

01:38:45.680 --> 01:38:47.780
around the reproductive
access to females,

01:38:47.780 --> 01:38:50.730
and you've got a whole
world of very peripheralized

01:38:50.730 --> 01:38:53.499
low ranking males
who never mate.

01:38:53.499 --> 01:38:55.040
And there's an
interesting physiology

01:38:55.040 --> 01:38:56.420
that goes along with it.

01:38:56.420 --> 01:38:59.090
That was the picture that
everybody used to have,

01:38:59.090 --> 01:39:02.980
and then in the 1970s, pioneer
researcher in this, Birute

01:39:02.980 --> 01:39:06.310
Galdikas, who has studied
orangs for decades

01:39:06.310 --> 01:39:09.110
out there in Indonesia,
she noted something

01:39:09.110 --> 01:39:12.550
really disturbing,
which is low ranking,

01:39:12.550 --> 01:39:16.290
non-reproductive male orangs
have an alternative mating

01:39:16.290 --> 01:39:17.110
strategy.

01:39:17.110 --> 01:39:18.220
What do they do?

01:39:18.220 --> 01:39:21.880
They rape females, and this
was the first introduction

01:39:21.880 --> 01:39:24.610
of that term into
zoology, and that is not

01:39:24.610 --> 01:39:26.050
an anthropomorphism.

01:39:26.050 --> 01:39:30.270
If defined as a violent
process of mating

01:39:30.270 --> 01:39:32.450
with a female against
her will, this

01:39:32.450 --> 01:39:34.540
is what goes on in orangutans.

01:39:34.540 --> 01:39:36.960
A certain percentage
of reproduction

01:39:36.960 --> 01:39:40.190
is low ranking guys who
have no direct access

01:39:40.190 --> 01:39:43.110
to females as a result of
male-male interactions.

01:39:43.110 --> 01:39:45.580
This is not the nice
guy alternative,

01:39:45.580 --> 01:39:47.730
so there is precedent
for this also.

01:39:47.730 --> 01:39:50.790
And this is by now very
well-documented behavior

01:39:50.790 --> 01:39:52.820
among orangutans.

01:39:52.820 --> 01:39:54.680
Then if you want to
call it with something

01:39:54.680 --> 01:39:57.390
very subtle and clever,
there's apparently

01:39:57.390 --> 01:39:59.720
this whole world
of fish species,

01:39:59.720 --> 01:40:02.840
where low ranking males
can pretend to be a female

01:40:02.840 --> 01:40:06.090
and take on female coloration
and pretend to be just

01:40:06.090 --> 01:40:08.342
friends and someone they
can pour their heart out to,

01:40:08.342 --> 01:40:10.175
and then suddenly one
day they have a penis,

01:40:10.175 --> 01:40:11.790
and where'd that come from?

01:40:11.790 --> 01:40:13.871
And everything
suddenly changes there.

01:40:13.871 --> 01:40:14.370
OK.

01:40:14.370 --> 01:40:17.170
So we have the very
strict boring models.

01:40:17.170 --> 01:40:19.630
Females invest more
calories than males,

01:40:19.630 --> 01:40:21.600
and, thus, they are
much more picky.

01:40:21.600 --> 01:40:24.050
Males mate with females
entirely as a function

01:40:24.050 --> 01:40:26.190
of male-male competition,
and thus, evolution

01:40:26.190 --> 01:40:29.720
is driven by male
aggression and all of that.

01:40:29.720 --> 01:40:32.070
Let me just see as
people are clearly

01:40:32.070 --> 01:40:33.548
about to run out the door.
