00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:07.791
Stanford University.

00:00:07.791 --> 00:00:08.290
--started.

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.900
See some exam-related
announcements.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.190
First off, there are the
statistics, mean and median,

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:21.739
which, in terms of
numbers and what

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:23.280
they mean-- what
they mean in my book

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.130
is that people are doing
a good job in here.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.990
So, good going.

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.830
Also having done an amazing
job are the TAs, who, other

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.500
than coming to
class here, have not

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.470
been allowed out of
the conference room

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:37.680
since you left your
exams with them.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.080
They have screamed with the
repetitiveness of grading

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.510
the same question 550 times.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.940
And they worked really hard
to get this back to you

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.420
guys in time for
decisions about pass,

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.090
no credit-- that sort of thing.

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:57.192
So these guys did yet
another amazing job.

00:00:57.192 --> 00:00:58.160
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERS]

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.128
Yay, TAs.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:03.800
Let's see.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.100
The other thing is, the
exams will be outside,

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.340
at the end of class.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.900
A to M is upstairs, and
the rest of those letters

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.010
are downstairs.

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.886
So start figuring
out which you are.

00:01:17.886 --> 00:01:21.360
The TAs will be flinging boxes
of exams around out there, so

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.520
go get yours afterward.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.720
Again, people did a good job.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.700
OK, picking up on our by now
sickeningly familiar time

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.450
core strategy thing, here,
we left off on Friday,

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.700
way to the left, in our very
last area of sexual behavior

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.490
and the logic there is--
ooh, somewhere along the way

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.710
we mentioned genes,
or we mentioned

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.730
a hormone, or a receptor,
or whatever, and thus

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:49.290
were immediately talking
about the evolution thereof,

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.300
all the way back.

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.550
What does natural
selection theory

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.620
tell us about the evolution
of sexual behavior?

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.410
And what we've been
doing is bouncing

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.100
between the two genders,
in terms of strategies,

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.680
starting off with
the basic asymmetry

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:08.639
of caloric expenditure on sperm
versus an egg plus a pregnancy,

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:11.360
plus, in most species,
raising the offspring.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.780
All of that giving rise
to the famed promiscuity

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.450
on the part of males-- the
lower levels of pickiness.

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.960
What we saw was the role
of male-male competition

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.080
and making sense
of behaviors that

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.550
are involved in passing
on more copies of genes.

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.670
We have also seen all
sorts of male strategies

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.900
for decreasing the reproductive
success of competitors

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.950
and, in the same
process, decreasing

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.880
that of females for the future.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.280
And female counterstrategies
in a lot of those cases.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.190
What we also then
transitioned to

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.840
was what female choice
was about, even in species

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.440
that were tournament species.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.440
And what we transition
to now is looking

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.040
at aspects of
female-female competition,

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.060
in terms of sexual reproduction.

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.500
What you see is--
predominantly in species

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.230
that are pair-bonding,
that are monogamous--

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.860
what you see is the
potential for a great deal

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.460
of female-female competition
for access to males.

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:11.180
That ironic turn
of events where,

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:12.830
if the whole system
works-- where

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.670
you give birth and
the guy who believes

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.806
he's the father is going to
be taken care of the kids,

00:03:17.806 --> 00:03:21.900
and what you want is
someone who is good at that,

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.290
is confident at that, can act
maternal in a convincing way,

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.340
and thus is subject to a
whole lot of competition

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:29.840
on the part of females.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.020
And thus what you get
is selection pressures

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.260
in those species-- New World
monkeys, for example-- a lot

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.420
of bird species--
selection pressures.

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.490
Where, if anything,
it's the females

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:43.930
who wind up being more
aggressive than the males.

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.690
The females who tend
to have the larger body

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.060
size, who have the
more pronounced

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.160
secondary sexual
characteristics.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.530
What's that about?

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:57.280
It's females competing with
females for males to pick them,

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.930
exactly the opposite scenario
as in most of the species

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.950
we've been hearing about.

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:03.860
OK.

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.760
What this then brings us to
is the next great question,

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.820
which already I've
had a lot of people

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.880
ask me during breaks-- all
the way back way there,

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.910
in terms of making
sense of the evolution

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.519
of this type of sexual
behavior and that type

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.470
and the other type, in terms of
passing on copies of your genes

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.178
and you and your
relatives-- all of that.

00:04:22.178 --> 00:04:25.810
Which brings you, inevitably,
to the question of, well, what

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.000
about the evolution
of homosexuality?

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.100
Because this has
always been the puzzle

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.350
in the book of zoologist,
evolutionary biologist,

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.270
et cetera, trying
to make sense of all

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.440
of this in the
context of adaptation

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.430
and passing on copies of
genes, especially when you

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.010
see how widespread this
is in lots and lots

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:47.390
and lots of other species.

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:48.800
What's up with that?

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.260
Because, up until
relatively recent times,

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.870
across virtually every
culture out there,

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.620
gay men had a much fewer
number of copies of genes,

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.980
on the average, that
they were passing on.

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:03.890
How could this trait
to be so universal?

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:08.580
And best estimates are 5% to
20% rate in every human culture

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:09.670
ever looked at.

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:11.610
So what's the
selection for that?

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.520
Or why hasn't that
been selected against?

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.220
Basically, there's
been three theories

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:18.700
that have floated around.

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:22.660
And all of them are predicated
on one very simple fact that

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.830
still is not all
that factual, which

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:28.290
is that there is a
genetic component to one's

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:29.790
sexual orientation.

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:32.480
And we already heard all
sorts of bits of evidence

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.840
about prenatal endocrine
environment that

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.550
argues in other directions.

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:40.020
We have already heard that there
have been those studies which

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:43.940
find covariance of
sexual orientation

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.700
in identical twins
versus nonidentical--

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:49.460
finding a genetic marker,
but one that nobody else

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:50.730
is able to replicate.

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:53.460
So everything now is
predicated on the notion

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.310
that, well, genes have at
least a little bit of something

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:57.730
to do with it.

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:00.170
So, three theories that
have floated around,

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:04.780
first one being the
heterozygotic-vigor argument.

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:06.470
Lots of folks will
recognize that

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:08.080
from other realms of genetics.

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.420
That's the deal where you
can have certain traits which

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:16.810
can be in the homozygotic form
or in the heterozygotic form.

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:18.900
And people who are
new to this, go back

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:22.420
and check your notes from
the Mendel genetics catch-up

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:23.170
sections.

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:26.300
And what you see is,
with lots of diseases

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.820
you get an extreme version
is indeed a disease

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:33.830
and a partial version
is, in fact, adaptive.

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:37.540
And the classic example
that always gets trotted out

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:41.390
is sickle-cell anemia--
full-blown homozygotic version,

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:46.350
horrible hematological disorder;
partial, heterozygotic version,

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:51.100
resistance to malaria and a
gazillion diseases out there.

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:52.610
And what's done
is metaphorically

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:56.610
running the same argument of
saying, whatever gene genes are

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:59.870
relevant, maybe the
homozygotic form

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:03.770
is the one that produces a
behavioral phenotype which

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:06.150
decreases reproductive success.

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:08.500
But there's some
heterozygotic form

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:14.010
which has some huge advantage
and enough of one to outweigh

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:16.830
the one-fourth of the
relatives who wind up

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:18.700
with the homozygotic version.

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:22.510
So that's one model, for which
there is very little evidence.

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:23.840
Next one.

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:29.720
Next one is a gender-dependent
genetic argument, as follows.

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:31.040
It is a trait.

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.840
It is a genetically
influenced trait

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:36.790
which, when expressed
in one gender,

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:40.870
is maladaptive and decreases
reproductive success.

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:43.210
But when it is expressed
in the other gender,

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:47.130
it is highly adaptive and
increases reproductive success.

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:50.650
And you can immediately run
your numbers argument there

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:54.440
that, as long as the benefits
for the other kind of sibling

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:57.600
or gender is larger
than the detriment here,

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:59.530
this is going to
be selected for.

00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:00.850
What would that look like?

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:02.880
Where is the evidence for that?

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:07.210
What one would predict is that
you would see, for gay men,

00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:10.230
that their sisters have
a higher-than-average

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:11.710
reproductive rate.

00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:14.900
And that is absolutely
there in the literature.

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:17.440
So the people who push
for this view would say,

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:21.180
aha, there is some sort
of trait which, in a male,

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:25.240
increases the likelihood,
manifesting as homosexuality

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:28.260
in a female, as some
route by which there is

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.210
increased reproductive success.

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:34.080
The third model is the
"helper at the nest" model,

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:38.890
which is that the individual
who traditionally is not

00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:40.710
passing on copies
of their own genes

00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:42.919
directly-- instead,
what they're doing

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:46.790
is expending resources on
helping their siblings.

00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:49.820
OK, so that kind of sounds
like the second model, also.

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:51.110
What's the difference?

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:55.080
The second model says
that sisters of gay men

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.420
should have increased
reproductive rates.

00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:59.700
What the third model--
the "helping at the nest"

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:03.300
model-- suggests is,
both sisters and brothers

00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:05.530
should have increased
reproductive rates.

00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:08.370
And that's actually
what's mostly been seen.

00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:12.520
So, support for this "helper
at the nest" kin-selection

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:13.890
kind of argument.

00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:14.570
OK.

00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:18.950
What else does one look
for in a mate, besides all

00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:20.960
of the stuff that males
are competing about

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:23.330
and females in
pair-bonding species?

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:25.180
What are some of the
characteristics that

00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:28.210
pop up over and over again,
when it's getting around

00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:32.690
to who looks good to you, if
you are a damselfly trying

00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:35.360
to pick out a mate, and in
all these other species?

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:37.930
One initial
characteristic, which

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:43.100
is the famed role of facial
symmetry in attractiveness.

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:46.340
This has an interesting
history, and this goes back

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:47.710
to the 19th century.

00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:51.460
And there was some
guy-- who was it?

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:52.830
It was Francis Galton.

00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:53.330
Was it?

00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:56.850
Maybe.

00:09:56.850 --> 00:09:58.850
And it was Francis
Galton, I think,

00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:01.420
who was having--
no, it couldn't be.

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:04.054
They didn't have-- forget that.

00:10:04.054 --> 00:10:04.970
Don't write that down.

00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:07.570
There was some guy in
the 19th century who

00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:14.150
was a famous criminologist and
was pushing a classic nonsense

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:17.840
theory of the time, which is
that there is a criminal face

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:22.260
and that people who are really
skilled police people could

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.200
to look at somebody's face
beforehand and immediately

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:27.640
predict that this is
someone who is going

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:29.600
to commit a criminal
act, inevitably,

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:32.150
at some-- all sorts of nonsense.

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:36.630
Genetic determinism and
racism and [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:39.160
biases of all sorts
running through there.

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:42.310
Complete nonsense-- yet one
of the dominant intellectual

00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:44.890
models in criminology
in the 19th century

00:10:44.890 --> 00:10:47.910
was that there are facial
characteristics that

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:50.720
are typical of criminals.

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:54.340
So this was this individual
who decided to come up

00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:57.810
with the archetypal face of
what a criminal looks like

00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:00.740
and managed to get photographs
of the faces of a whole bunch

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:04.140
of different criminals,
pulling them out of the jail

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:07.630
or whatever and taking a picture
with the newly invented camera.

00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:12.410
And, through some technique that
clearly was some proto Adobe

00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:14.920
Photoshop sort of
ancestor thing,

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:18.660
was able to overlap the
faces in order to come up

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:20.120
with a composite face.

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:23.430
And this composite face
was now going to tell you,

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:26.040
this is the most
criminal-looking face

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:28.150
that anybody has ever seen.

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:29.650
And that's not what happened.

00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:31.720
Instead, everybody
looked at that face

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:34.670
and said, hey, that guy's
kind of good-looking!

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:37.100
That guy is, in fact,
really good-looking.

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:40.400
And had just stumbled on
this interesting thing that,

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:45.180
when you average faces, when
you toss them all together,

00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:48.200
that when you merge
them, they look

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:50.190
more attractive
than the individuals

00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:54.270
that they came from-- when
you make composite pictures.

00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:59.960
And this has kept all sorts of
people happy doing experiments

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:03.320
where they do mixes and
matches of starting with 100

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:06.870
different pictures of people
and combine subsets of them

00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:09.420
and having people rating
attractiveness and stuff.

00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:12.360
And it's this absolutely
bizarre thing--

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:15.490
that the more faces that go
into a composite, the more,

00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:18.760
on the average, people perceive
them as being attractive,

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:21.700
amid incredibly
subtle differences

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:25.910
between a composite picture
of 50 faces versus 25,

00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:29.760
all of that, people are able to
pick up the differences-- not

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:31.490
necessarily consciously.

00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:33.530
So what is that about?

00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:38.254
And what became clear,
many decades later,

00:12:38.254 --> 00:12:39.670
is that what happens
when you make

00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:42.340
a lot of faces all
into one composite

00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:46.350
is you get a highly
symmetrical face.

00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:49.810
And this seems to be the
key thing that comes through

00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:51.720
in that realm of attractiveness.

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:55.580
Which is that, when you average
in a whole lot of faces,

00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:59.330
one of the things you average
is the averageness of the face.

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:01.250
And you get rid of asymmetries.

00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:06.620
And everyone knows that-- who
would you want to mate with?

00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:07.120
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:10.460
OK, so, thereby
proving the point.

00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:14.500
And what you've got is,
symmetry is apparently

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:16.720
a good, reliable
marker of health.

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:20.070
Wildly asymmetric
faces are typically

00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:23.820
the result of complications--
developmental ones-- health

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:24.780
sort of issues.

00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:28.630
So the general interpretation
is that symmetry is attractive

00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:31.790
because it is a
marker of health.

00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:34.760
And every single
article you will ever

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:36.987
read in sort of the
lay press-- or even

00:13:36.987 --> 00:13:38.570
in some of the science
journals, which

00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:40.070
should be above
this sort of thing--

00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:43.580
will have the picture of some
famously attractive somebody

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:45.340
or other, with
the face up there,

00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:47.950
and all the little caliper
markings, and showing

00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:51.760
the same sizes, and then
some poor schnook who's

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:56.170
chosen to be the asymmetric
face who's stuck up there.

00:13:56.170 --> 00:14:00.420
Did the Newsweek article wind
up being in the readings?

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:02.380
No, it wasn't-- yes.

00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:03.530
OK.

00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:05.670
Lyle Lovett-- is that
the face they had there

00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:08.630
that they were making vicious
fun of and pointing out

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:10.540
lip asymmetries and such?

00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:15.730
Something about the symmetry
seems to be a marker for health

00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:17.390
and is considered
more attractive.

00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:20.720
And people can pick up
astonishingly subtle

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:22.620
asymmetries in faces.

00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:26.240
Babies, at two
months of age, show--

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:28.680
when you are doing
morphed faces,

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:33.350
composite faces, where you
can very minorly adjust

00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:36.750
the degree of symmetry or
asymmetry in the face-- babies,

00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:39.030
at two months of
age, are already

00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:43.500
preferring to look at pictures
of more symmetrical faces.

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:46.730
You find this in lots of
other species, as well.

00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:50.040
When you look at
animals lever-pressing--

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:51.830
rats, for example,
getting access

00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:54.530
to other rats of
the opposite gender.

00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:57.380
And you will see there's
a bias for symmetry there.

00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:59.470
There is a bias in
nonhuman primates

00:14:59.470 --> 00:15:01.290
for more symmetrical faces.

00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:03.480
How's this for a
nutty study that

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:07.380
was published about five
years ago, in Nature?

00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:11.290
And this one reported that
people who had symmetrical

00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:15.200
faces were better dancers.

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:17.450
OK, let's work through that one.

00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:19.090
What was that one about?

00:15:19.090 --> 00:15:23.090
And they did-- it
was a bizarre study,

00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:26.050
but somehow, nonetheless,
it was irresistible.

00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:27.070
Here's what they showed.

00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:30.030
They filmed all sorts
of people dancing.

00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:32.380
And, no doubt, they
did perfect controls

00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:34.540
and they, like,
made sure everybody

00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:36.570
danced to the same
thing, which was,

00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:40.660
like-- oh, I don't
know-- something--

00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:43.390
a scientist rapping
to something or other.

00:15:43.390 --> 00:15:45.090
And people dancing away, there.

00:15:45.090 --> 00:15:47.729
And then they used
this amazing technique,

00:15:47.729 --> 00:15:49.520
which I didn't understand
in the slightest,

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:52.960
with some sort of
camera-capture technique

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:55.780
that would make everybody
dancing look like Gumby.

00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:59.080
So you took out all the
individual features-- anything

00:15:59.080 --> 00:15:59.600
at all.

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:01.600
And people would then
rate them on the dancing.

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:03.350
And it would turn
out that people

00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:06.320
who were rated by both
genders, of either gender,

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:08.630
as being a better
dancer, when you then

00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:10.860
went and checked out
their faces afterward,

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:14.950
with your slide rule, turned out
to have more symmetrical faces.

00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:15.790
Whoa!

00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:17.260
Isn't that bizarre?

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:21.020
My guess would be that this is
one of those indirect routes

00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:23.210
that we've already
seen some examples of.

00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:26.270
My guess would be,
more symmetrical faces

00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:29.660
are thus more attractive,
and thus such people

00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:33.090
are treated better and
are more confident in life

00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:36.142
and more extroverted and
more comfortable dancing

00:16:36.142 --> 00:16:37.600
when they knew that
they were going

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:39.230
to wind up looking like Gumby.

00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:42.520
So that is probably what
the indirect route is.

00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:46.630
But running through all of
this is this symmetry business.

00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:48.940
And it's there in
species after species.

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:53.210
And humans are amazing at
picking up subtleties at it.

00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:57.360
One additional finding in
the symmetry world-- women

00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:00.100
at the time that
they are ovulating

00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:05.246
have their faces become ever
so slightly more symmetrical.

00:17:05.246 --> 00:17:06.329
[COMMENTS AMONG  STUDENTS]

00:17:06.329 --> 00:17:09.310
OK, well, that's
going to get people

00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:12.270
all nutsy in the
coming weeks, no doubt,

00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:14.400
trying to figure out
what that's about.

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:17.040
I did not see a good explanation
as to what that was about,

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:19.770
but that has been observed
in the literature.

00:17:19.770 --> 00:17:21.920
So the first thing,
in terms of what

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:23.960
one looks for in
a mate, if you're

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:28.170
some basic social animal-- first
set of features, this business

00:17:28.170 --> 00:17:29.890
about symmetry.

00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:33.430
Next realm-- this whole
world of secondary sexual

00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:34.960
characteristics.

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:39.800
Why is it that female
peacocks like male peacocks

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:42.620
to look like male peacocks,
and all that sort of thing?

00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:44.180
What is that about?

00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:46.980
And people have been working
with this one for years.

00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:49.520
And there is a
zoologist named Zahavi

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:52.270
who has been very influential--
Israeli zoologist--

00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:55.700
who came up with what is called
the "handicap principle."

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:56.700
As follows.

00:17:56.700 --> 00:18:01.400
Why is it that secondary sexual
characteristics are appealing?

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:05.450
Characteristics that exaggerate
the difference in appearance

00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:06.470
by gender.

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:07.500
Why is that appealing?

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:11.570
Because, in effect, the bigger
and more garish and the more

00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:14.700
over-the-top your secondary
sexual characteristic is,

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:17.050
the more you were
communicating to the world,

00:18:17.050 --> 00:18:21.610
I have so much energy on
board, and I am so healthy,

00:18:21.610 --> 00:18:25.090
that I can afford to squander
massive numbers of calories

00:18:25.090 --> 00:18:28.410
on these asinine neon antlers
I'm walking around with.

00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:30.530
That it's an argument
there that this

00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:34.780
is a display of, in a sense,
conspicuous consumption--

00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:39.110
the ability to put energy into
these large secondary sexual

00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:39.990
characteristics.

00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:44.940
That these are markers of health
and of good immune systems.

00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:46.790
Lots of evidence for this.

00:18:46.790 --> 00:18:50.170
And this is, by now, a whole
field that people have studied.

00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:51.690
One version of it.

00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:55.151
These were studies done
with marsupial mice.

00:18:55.151 --> 00:18:56.650
And there was
something having to do

00:18:56.650 --> 00:18:59.280
with their marsupialesque
reproduction that

00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:01.770
made this the species
to do this with.

00:19:01.770 --> 00:19:06.760
But it was doing sperm
insemination of females.

00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:10.150
And what was done was
that they took the sperm

00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:13.850
from these male marsupial
mice, after measuring

00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:16.680
some secondary sexual
characteristics in them.

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:18.550
I believe that they
don't have antlers,

00:19:18.550 --> 00:19:20.740
but I don't remember what
the actual thing was.

00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:22.520
And what they were
able to do was

00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:25.410
to now have sperm from
males of differing

00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:29.340
degrees of exaggerated
secondary characteristics.

00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:32.410
And what they showed
was that the males who

00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:36.190
had the more dramatic secondary
characteristics-- their sperm

00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:38.050
were more fertile.

00:19:38.050 --> 00:19:42.030
So that was a first big vote
in this handicap principle

00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:45.810
that things like
secondary appearances,

00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:51.220
secondary sexual ones,
can be a marker for health

00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:53.320
and/or fertility.

00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:54.900
Now why should that be?

00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:58.870
What you essentially are seeing
there is, it is a display.

00:19:58.870 --> 00:20:00.390
It is a potlatch.

00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:02.430
It is a display
of how much energy

00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:05.650
you can afford to waste
and thus how much you

00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:07.020
must have on board.

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:10.650
It is a marker of health
and good immunity.

00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:13.250
This has been shown
in lots of studies.

00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:16.190
Along the lines
of, the same sort

00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:20.830
of signals that give rise to the
secondary sexual characteristic

00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:23.460
are markers of immune function.

00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:26.050
A well-functioning
immune system will

00:20:26.050 --> 00:20:29.150
be generating some
molecule which

00:20:29.150 --> 00:20:31.480
exaggerates facial coloration.

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:33.676
And that's the secondary
sexual characteristic--

00:20:33.676 --> 00:20:38.630
that there is an explicit
link between immune function,

00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:42.350
immune competence,
and these markers.

00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:43.230
Interesting.

00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:45.240
A study that just
came out recently,

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:48.660
looking at women from,
I believe it was,

00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:51.390
about 20 different
industrialized countries.

00:20:51.390 --> 00:20:55.250
And what was shown was
that, in general, women

00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:57.300
have a preference
for faces of men

00:20:57.300 --> 00:21:00.040
that have strong pronounced
secondary characteristics--

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:03.110
which is, big, jutting
jaw, high forehead,

00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:05.160
lots of muscle stuff going on.

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:09.380
And what they showed was that
the longer the life expectancy

00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:12.480
in the particular country,
the better the economy,

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:16.150
the better the quality of life,
the less women in that country

00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:19.710
had a bias towards
male-looking males.

00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:21.950
Which is extremely interesting.

00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:23.420
What's the comparison there?

00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:26.930
It was all those, like,
Scandinavian countries.

00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:28.740
Thank god for the
Scandinavian countries,

00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:32.370
because they always provide the
extreme of these distributions.

00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:34.250
So, in those
Scandinavian countries,

00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:36.920
like, there has not
been a guy who's been,

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:38.970
like, selected for a date
because of the height

00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:41.710
of his forehead, in centuries.

00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:45.380
Whereas what they showed was,
in a lot of other cultures--

00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:48.360
which were the ones who were
most extreme on the list,

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:50.720
I am not remembering,
which is not very helpful.

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:52.900
But a very different
sort of end of things.

00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:56.040
And there, much stronger
selection for what

00:21:56.040 --> 00:22:00.950
are viewed as traits, as
markers of fecundity and health.

00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:02.760
More evidence about this.

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:08.910
What you see is, all of this
is a signal-- all of this

00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:14.740
is a signal, not only in terms
of who you want to mate with,

00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:18.310
in terms of who you are
passing on your copies of genes

00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:21.890
in cooperation with,
but also the possibility

00:22:21.890 --> 00:22:25.030
that the other individual
is infectious with something

00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:25.740
or other.

00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:28.960
And throughout the
world of social beasts,

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:32.430
nobody likes getting sexually
transmitted diseases.

00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:35.860
And a lot of what this whole
handicap principle is about,

00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:39.530
a lot of this advertising about
what a great immune system you

00:22:39.530 --> 00:22:42.470
have, is a way of
advertising, I do not

00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:44.690
have a communicable disease.

00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:47.330
All sorts of
species-- individuals

00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:50.820
are extremely good at
detecting the smells

00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:54.040
in the others of
parasitic infections,

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:56.300
of all sorts of
other infections,

00:22:56.300 --> 00:22:58.890
and avoiding them
like the plague.

00:22:58.890 --> 00:23:01.810
A common theme in lots
and lots of species.

00:23:01.810 --> 00:23:05.560
Rodents, where it's been most
studied-- a remarkable ability

00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:08.300
to smell out the health
of another individual.

00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:11.540
And this is someone you want to
stay away from-- that they're

00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:13.370
going to give you an STD.

00:23:13.370 --> 00:23:16.280
So that's part of it, as well.

00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:18.330
So, of course, what
you start getting

00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:21.660
are individuals trying
to cheat at all of this.

00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:25.070
And this is suddenly
the world of selection

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:29.240
to uncouple your secondary
sexual characteristics

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:30.640
from your health.

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:32.680
Is there a way to cheat?

00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:33.530
Is there a way?

00:23:33.530 --> 00:23:36.590
And what is seen in
some bird species is,

00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:39.290
you've got some guy on
his deathbed, there.

00:23:39.290 --> 00:23:42.890
And what's he doing with
his last 3 and 1/2 calories

00:23:42.890 --> 00:23:44.000
worth of energy?

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.000
He's expending it
on wing coloration

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.940
or whatever the secondary
characteristic thing is, there,

00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:52.220
that he's got four
minutes of life left,

00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:53.630
and maybe there's
one more chance

00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:55.490
to pass on copies of his genes.

00:23:55.490 --> 00:23:57.210
You get cheating, as well.

00:23:57.210 --> 00:24:00.870
You get cases of
disproportionate shunting

00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:04.280
of caloric investment
towards some of these markers

00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:06.560
amid animals being sick.

00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:09.660
So, of course, you have
to have counterstrategies.

00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:12.840
And we have yet another
world of coevolution

00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:16.040
between some sort of
exploitative strategy

00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:19.170
and a counter one to
try to detect that.

00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:22.070
Then you've got one problem with
this whole literature, which

00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:25.020
is, there is a certain way to
frame things so that you never,

00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:27.270
ever can get a
finding that disagrees

00:24:27.270 --> 00:24:28.890
with your general stance.

00:24:28.890 --> 00:24:30.234
OK, here's how it goes.

00:24:30.234 --> 00:24:31.650
Here's the version
that we've just

00:24:31.650 --> 00:24:33.890
heard of this handicap
principle, which

00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:37.620
is, what you have to have
is your secondary sexual

00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:42.710
characteristic-- the intensity
of it has to be reflective

00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:45.710
of the quality of
your immune system.

00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:49.220
And in lots of species,
facial coloration

00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:52.630
is generated molecules
from the immune system

00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:54.480
in a linear relationship, there.

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:56.570
Yes, that is a way
of advertising,

00:24:56.570 --> 00:24:59.090
I've got a great immune system.

00:24:59.090 --> 00:25:00.090
But get this.

00:25:00.090 --> 00:25:03.630
Meanwhile, you can have
exactly the opposite case,

00:25:03.630 --> 00:25:07.880
which is, you can have your
secondary sexual characteristic

00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:11.120
driven by an infection
that you have.

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:14.690
And what you are presumably
communicating is, if I'm still

00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:17.080
able to do this ridiculous
courtship dance,

00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:19.680
despite the fact that I'm
teeming with parasites,

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:22.710
I've got the greatest
DNA going around, there.

00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:24.070
Hey, how about it?

00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:26.620
Where you see this
is in vultures.

00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:28.811
And the mere notion that
vultures having sex,

00:25:28.811 --> 00:25:31.310
and let alone them having sex
based on thinking some of them

00:25:31.310 --> 00:25:33.310
are more attractive
than others, leaves

00:25:33.310 --> 00:25:36.150
me breathless with admiration.

00:25:36.150 --> 00:25:38.820
But what you see
is, in vultures--

00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:41.950
I'm forgetting which
species-- sexually dimorphic--

00:25:41.950 --> 00:25:43.970
the males have more
colorful faces.

00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:48.330
They tend to have these orange
faces made out of carotenoids--

00:25:48.330 --> 00:25:50.200
these pigment things.

00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:51.430
These carotenoids.

00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:53.660
So one version that
we've heard already

00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:56.480
is, OK, where are the
carotenoids coming from?

00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:58.540
They're produced in
the immune system.

00:25:58.540 --> 00:26:01.890
And the happier your immune
system, the more carotenoids

00:26:01.890 --> 00:26:02.870
you pump out.

00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:05.010
That would be the first
scenario we've heard.

00:26:05.010 --> 00:26:08.520
In vultures, you see
exactly the opposite.

00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:11.851
Which is, where-- this is going
to go downhill really fast,

00:26:11.851 --> 00:26:12.350
now.

00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:14.470
So where do you get
carotenoids, if you

00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:17.010
are a vulture in the
plains of East Africa?

00:26:17.010 --> 00:26:21.360
You get them by
eating ungulate feces.

00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:25.065
Which vultures are perfectly
happy to do, if it's fresh--

00:26:25.065 --> 00:26:26.840
or even if it's not so fresh.

00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:30.480
And what that will typically
contain are lots of parasites.

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:32.770
Consuming a whole lot
of ungulate feces,

00:26:32.770 --> 00:26:34.820
rather than, say,
ungulate muscle,

00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:37.740
increases the likelihood that
you have some sort of infection

00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:38.790
that you've picked up.

00:26:38.790 --> 00:26:40.620
What's the interpretation there?

00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:45.140
Yet here I am, bouncing around
happily and energetically.

00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:47.300
Just imagine how
great my genes are,

00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:51.380
if I'm able to do that amid just
teeming with parasites, because

00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:54.820
of my unlikely sort
of dietary habits.

00:26:54.820 --> 00:26:57.870
So you've got it, here,
that it can go both ways.

00:26:57.870 --> 00:27:00.930
Ooh, dramatic secondary
sexual characteristic

00:27:00.930 --> 00:27:02.960
is a marker of a
good immune system--

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:04.540
I can fight off disease.

00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:08.110
Dramatic secondary sexual
characteristic as a marker of,

00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:10.020
look how well I'm
functioning, here,

00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:12.590
despite teeming
with some disease.

00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:13.620
You get it both ways.

00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:16.220
It remains very,
very controversial--

00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:19.200
for the three and a half people
who deeply care about this.

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:22.880
One additional version of that--
and the "there's no free lunch,

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:26.620
and there is no free
ungulate"-- whatever-- OK,

00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:29.960
one additional version of that
are studies now showing that

00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:34.530
in lions what you get is--
highly tournament species,

00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:37.790
and thus a highly dramatic
set of secondary sexual

00:27:37.790 --> 00:27:38.810
characteristics.

00:27:38.810 --> 00:27:39.890
The manes.

00:27:39.890 --> 00:27:41.470
The manes on the lion.

00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:43.870
And what everybody
knows from The Lion King

00:27:43.870 --> 00:27:46.380
is that they can be very
big and dramatic-looking

00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:48.947
and thus make you
very attractive.

00:27:48.947 --> 00:27:50.530
Unless you're hanging
out with hyenas.

00:27:50.530 --> 00:27:53.780
But what is clear, also,
is, it comes with a price.

00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:57.560
What is the most attractive
sort of male lion you can see?

00:27:57.560 --> 00:27:59.470
It's a black-maned male.

00:27:59.470 --> 00:28:03.090
Because that is one
that is most expensive,

00:28:03.090 --> 00:28:05.420
in this
handicap-principle sense.

00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:07.180
But there's a
downside, if you've

00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:11.240
got a black mane, which is,
your head heats up more, sitting

00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:12.820
there in the African sun.

00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:16.090
You've got to spend more
energy on thermal regulation.

00:28:16.090 --> 00:28:17.890
There's a downside to it.

00:28:17.890 --> 00:28:21.010
All of these things,
where you're balancing.

00:28:21.010 --> 00:28:21.990
What else?

00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:23.690
What else, in terms
of attractiveness?

00:28:23.690 --> 00:28:25.680
So we've now got,
lots of species,

00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:28.830
the symmetry business
as a marker for health.

00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:32.090
The secondary sexual
characteristic nonsense

00:28:32.090 --> 00:28:35.170
stuff as a marker of
health but interpretable

00:28:35.170 --> 00:28:36.900
in a number of different ways.

00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:40.290
Then there are the secondary
sexual characteristics

00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:43.970
that are more directly
markers of fertility.

00:28:43.970 --> 00:28:45.840
And what we've
entered into, here,

00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:48.940
is the world of primate
species, where females

00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:51.890
have external swellings
when ovulating,

00:28:51.890 --> 00:28:56.340
when there are visible signs
of estrus, of going into heat.

00:28:56.340 --> 00:28:58.550
Humans are concealed ovulators.

00:28:58.550 --> 00:29:00.940
And we already know some
of the theories about that.

00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:05.560
But all the other primates get
explicit, observable estrus

00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:09.300
swellings when it is time
that they're ovulating.

00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:12.030
And all you need to
do is look at baboons.

00:29:12.030 --> 00:29:14.110
And beginning somewhere
around junior high,

00:29:14.110 --> 00:29:17.270
when they start hitting
puberty, some females

00:29:17.270 --> 00:29:19.560
have bigger swellings
than other females.

00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:23.270
And it turns out, these
stupid, shallow male baboons

00:29:23.270 --> 00:29:25.560
prefer the ones with the
big swellings to the ones

00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:26.870
with the small swellings.

00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:29.590
You can even show, with
captive male baboons,

00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:31.840
that they will
lever-press more to get

00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:34.250
to see pictures
of female baboons

00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:36.920
with big swellings instead
of middle-sized ones

00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:37.840
or little ones.

00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:41.330
There you go.

00:29:41.330 --> 00:29:45.000
Somewhere out there, there
is a magnificent reality

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.690
show to be set up
along those lines.

00:29:47.690 --> 00:29:50.900
What you see with that is,
what's the swellings about?

00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:54.320
It is a marker of
estrogen levels.

00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:57.660
It is a marker of-- the
higher the estrogen levels,

00:29:57.660 --> 00:29:59.270
the more the swelling.

00:29:59.270 --> 00:30:02.110
And what you wind up
seeing, in various studies

00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:04.630
by now, replicated,
showing that,

00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:08.180
among female nonhuman
primates, those females

00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:12.090
with larger swellings have
a better infant survival

00:30:12.090 --> 00:30:14.140
during the first year
of life of the kids.

00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:18.580
It's a marker of greater
fertility and greater health.

00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:22.640
And there's maybe some element
of a handicap principle

00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:25.690
there, because by the time
you get female monkeys

00:30:25.690 --> 00:30:28.170
with the biggest
swellings around, they now

00:30:28.170 --> 00:30:31.780
weigh about 25% more than they
weigh the rest of the time,

00:30:31.780 --> 00:30:34.030
all because of the
water retention.

00:30:34.030 --> 00:30:35.630
And presumably
part of the signal

00:30:35.630 --> 00:30:38.090
there is, if I can
be running around

00:30:38.090 --> 00:30:40.070
in my female-in-estrus
sort of way,

00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:44.440
despite 25% more weight sloshing
around at the end of me, just

00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:46.790
imagine how strong
and healthy I am.

00:30:46.790 --> 00:30:49.920
So that, as a source
of attraction.

00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:52.530
Meanwhile, over at the
male end of things,

00:30:52.530 --> 00:30:57.280
in terms of looking for
other markers of attraction

00:30:57.280 --> 00:30:59.620
in females-- by the
time you get to humans,

00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:02.240
we are not, again,
external ovulators.

00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:07.310
But what you have with humans
is the famed waist-hip ratio

00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:08.060
measure.

00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:11.860
And this one has been endlessly
studied and argued about.

00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:15.970
The notion that the larger
the size of the hips,

00:31:15.970 --> 00:31:18.660
relative to the size of
the waist, the greater

00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:21.850
the waist-hip ratio--
no, the lesser

00:31:21.850 --> 00:31:24.110
the-- flip that
around the other way.

00:31:24.110 --> 00:31:24.650
OK.

00:31:24.650 --> 00:31:27.300
The bigger the hips are,
relative to the waist--

00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:29.630
this is a marker of fertility.

00:31:29.630 --> 00:31:32.970
That is a marker of
childbearing pelvises.

00:31:32.970 --> 00:31:35.850
That is a marker of all
sorts of developmental health

00:31:35.850 --> 00:31:39.200
that augurs well for having
a baby pass through the birth

00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:39.870
canal.

00:31:39.870 --> 00:31:42.990
In culture after
culture, men find

00:31:42.990 --> 00:31:46.910
women to be more attractive
who have a higher-skewed ratio

00:31:46.910 --> 00:31:49.260
of hip to waist.

00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:52.130
So that's been studied
all over the place.

00:31:52.130 --> 00:31:55.100
What you have, though, as
the central controversy

00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:58.230
in that field is, if every
single culture that that's

00:31:58.230 --> 00:32:02.140
been studied in has been
contaminated by their exposure

00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:05.550
to westernized culture
and its pervasive values,

00:32:05.550 --> 00:32:07.180
which may be the source of that.

00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:10.270
So, among the hip-waist
sort of zealots,

00:32:10.270 --> 00:32:15.150
what has been the Golden
Fleece to go after,

00:32:15.150 --> 00:32:17.440
what has been the
equivalent of getting

00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:20.700
identical twins separated at
birth, what is the thing they

00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:23.900
go after, is to find
a population of humans

00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:27.070
who are having their first
contact with the outside world

00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:30.360
and have had no exposure
to the westernized world.

00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:32.880
And thus you are able
to rush in there,

00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:34.970
quickly master their
language, and, once you've

00:32:34.970 --> 00:32:37.280
done that, you get to ask
them the first question

00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:40.430
in their entire content with
the westernized world, which

00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:42.670
is, so, which of these
look better to you?

00:32:42.670 --> 00:32:44.140
Asking the guys, there.

00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:47.100
And, at this point--
not surprisingly,

00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:49.550
there is not a huge
literature of asking people,

00:32:49.550 --> 00:32:52.990
on the first encounters, about
hip-waist ratios-- what you see

00:32:52.990 --> 00:32:55.380
is, the literature is mixed.

00:32:55.380 --> 00:32:58.080
When you look at more
traditional societies,

00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:00.980
you do not necessarily
see as strong

00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:05.200
of a hip-waist-ratio
set of opinions.

00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:07.260
But nonetheless, at
least some of that

00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:10.120
is universal in every culture
that's been looked at.

00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:13.610
Again, as a marker of fertility.

00:33:13.610 --> 00:33:16.097
Meanwhile, over at the
female end of things,

00:33:16.097 --> 00:33:17.930
you've already heard
what some of the things

00:33:17.930 --> 00:33:21.050
are that are looked for,
in terms of responsiveness

00:33:21.050 --> 00:33:23.260
to secondary
characteristics in males,

00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:28.550
which is jutting jaws, big,
high foreheads, and muscle mass.

00:33:28.550 --> 00:33:31.660
And all of these are
assays indirectly

00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:33.990
of testosterone
levels or testosterone

00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:37.270
exposure or sensitivity
during adolescence.

00:33:37.270 --> 00:33:39.530
Those are preferred.

00:33:39.530 --> 00:33:40.940
Interesting thing.

00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:43.920
Studies showing that,
when you give women

00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:47.970
a choice of faces of males
that have been manipulated,

00:33:47.970 --> 00:33:50.120
changing the
dramatic-- how dramatic

00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:52.810
the secondary characteristics
are-- like forehead

00:33:52.810 --> 00:33:56.910
and jutting-jawedness and
angularity of face and stuff--

00:33:56.910 --> 00:33:59.540
what you see is an
interesting dichotomy.

00:33:59.540 --> 00:34:03.240
Which is, in these studies,
women on the average rate

00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:06.990
the rounder-faced
pictures of men, such men,

00:34:06.990 --> 00:34:11.830
looking more likable, more
honest, more trustworthy,

00:34:11.830 --> 00:34:15.969
and less desirable.

00:34:15.969 --> 00:34:16.739
OK.

00:34:16.739 --> 00:34:19.300
So this is hopeless.

00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:20.239
And what do you know?

00:34:20.239 --> 00:34:23.590
Those-- well, I won't
go there, either.

00:34:23.590 --> 00:34:27.600
What those show is
separable traits, there.

00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:29.400
Separable traits,
in terms of what's

00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:30.800
attractive-- what information.

00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:33.219
And, again, when you
look at these studies,

00:34:33.219 --> 00:34:37.915
the differences are, like, 5%
difference in nostril width

00:34:37.915 --> 00:34:41.179
and things, when they're manip--
these are extraordinarily

00:34:41.179 --> 00:34:44.639
subtle differences, where
people are not consciously aware

00:34:44.639 --> 00:34:45.159
of them.

00:34:45.159 --> 00:34:47.690
Which face looks
more attractive?

00:34:47.690 --> 00:34:49.850
Which face would you like more?

00:34:49.850 --> 00:34:52.590
Which face would you trust
more if they told you

00:34:52.590 --> 00:34:54.440
to vote for somebody or other?

00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:58.150
An interesting
separation, there.

00:34:58.150 --> 00:34:58.850
OK.

00:34:58.850 --> 00:35:03.250
One additional one
is that, in women,

00:35:03.250 --> 00:35:06.010
when women are
ovulating, they prefer

00:35:06.010 --> 00:35:08.770
more sexually secondary,
secondary-sexually

00:35:08.770 --> 00:35:11.430
characteristically
dramatic male faces.

00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:15.710
At the time of ovulation, women
rate as more attractive male

00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:19.990
faces with the juttier jaws
and the greater muscle mass

00:35:19.990 --> 00:35:22.020
and the forehead stuff going on.

00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:26.930
What we see here is this theme
of, at the time that estrogen

00:35:26.930 --> 00:35:30.090
levels are at their highest
in humans and lots of realms,

00:35:30.090 --> 00:35:32.770
in addition to other
species, detection

00:35:32.770 --> 00:35:35.850
of pheromones from males
is the most sensitive.

00:35:35.850 --> 00:35:38.030
Ability to pick up
subtle differences

00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:42.180
in facial symmetry or secondary
sexual characteristics

00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:43.120
are at their best.

00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:45.320
And the preferences
are derived from that.

00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:50.140
This is, in some cases, some
rather substantial effects.

00:35:50.140 --> 00:35:50.920
OK.

00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:53.550
So, what other things?

00:35:53.550 --> 00:35:56.761
There's one problem that runs
through this entire literature.

00:35:56.761 --> 00:35:57.260
OK.

00:35:57.260 --> 00:35:58.880
So here's the deal.

00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:03.380
You are a-- uh--
you're a gazelle.

00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:06.685
You're a female gazelle, and
you have read lots of zoology

00:36:06.685 --> 00:36:08.775
and you know all about
this handicap principle.

00:36:08.775 --> 00:36:12.170
And you know the fact that
big, dramatic secondary sexual

00:36:12.170 --> 00:36:14.640
characteristics on
guys is a marker

00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:17.440
of better immune systems
and more fertile sperm

00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:18.930
and all sorts of great stuff.

00:36:18.930 --> 00:36:22.270
So you go out of your way to
go and find one of those guys.

00:36:22.270 --> 00:36:23.620
You mate with him.

00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:26.090
And you've just given birth.

00:36:26.090 --> 00:36:30.290
So, knowing what you know, what
you, of course, now realize

00:36:30.290 --> 00:36:33.060
is, you've got a great
kid on your hands

00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:34.830
that have all these
terrific genes

00:36:34.830 --> 00:36:38.640
from that jutting-jawed
antelope guy you mated with.

00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:41.010
And you better make
sure this kid survives,

00:36:41.010 --> 00:36:43.570
because they have an
enormous potential

00:36:43.570 --> 00:36:46.470
for having a big reproductive
success later on.

00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:47.860
What do you do?

00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:52.360
You expend more calories
in taking care of them.

00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:55.180
This has been shown in
all sorts of species.

00:36:55.180 --> 00:36:59.680
Mate various birds in various
bird species-- mate females

00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:04.070
with males who are more
attractive versus mating them

00:37:04.070 --> 00:37:06.300
with less attractive,
and what you see

00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:08.720
is that the females
who have mated

00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:14.270
with the more attractive males
give birth to bigger eggs.

00:37:14.270 --> 00:37:15.620
That's interesting.

00:37:15.620 --> 00:37:18.270
OK, so you're seeing the
evidence of the good genes

00:37:18.270 --> 00:37:19.550
coming from the guy.

00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:22.610
Male genes have nothing
to do with egg size.

00:37:22.610 --> 00:37:25.410
It is how much
protein the mother

00:37:25.410 --> 00:37:28.690
puts into the egg production
and the egg development.

00:37:28.690 --> 00:37:32.430
And what you see is, she
makes this a self-fulfilling

00:37:32.430 --> 00:37:33.400
prophecy.

00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:35.510
In a lot of species,
now, it has been

00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:39.070
shown that when females mate
with more attractive males

00:37:39.070 --> 00:37:42.280
they put more effort into
having the offspring survive.

00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:43.860
The offspring survive better.

00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:45.520
And yes, what do you know?

00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:48.010
You really do want to mate
with guys with big antlers

00:37:48.010 --> 00:37:49.120
and that sort of thing.

00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:52.000
This big problem with
self-fulfilling stuff.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.070
So that's a confound that
has run through the field.

00:37:55.070 --> 00:37:57.230
Another confound--
and here is one

00:37:57.230 --> 00:38:01.100
that shows how many species
are far less distant from us

00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:02.180
than one might think.

00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:04.670
This was work by a
guy named Lee Dugatkin

00:38:04.670 --> 00:38:07.160
at the University of Kentucky.

00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:11.750
And what he does is study
ospreys or some kind

00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:13.750
of bird thing that runs around.

00:38:13.750 --> 00:38:19.440
And what he does is, he first
gets a male and female osprey,

00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:21.230
and he introduces
them to each other.

00:38:21.230 --> 00:38:23.360
And what he looks
for are circumstances

00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:26.390
where the magic does not occur.

00:38:26.390 --> 00:38:28.080
There is no chemistry
between them.

00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:30.090
The female rejects the guy.

00:38:30.090 --> 00:38:33.880
And, at that point, what he
does is, in the next round,

00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:37.560
he makes the male appear
to be very popular.

00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:40.300
He puts the male here,
and he takes a whole bunch

00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:43.400
of stuffed female birds
and puts them around

00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:47.740
in a circle around him, gawking
at him with rapt admiration

00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:50.625
and just frozen in their
place at the wonders of, like,

00:38:50.625 --> 00:38:54.110
the coloration on his bill from
eating who-knows-whose feces.

00:38:54.110 --> 00:38:56.710
And what you see
then is, the female

00:38:56.710 --> 00:39:00.190
who spurned him is
now more likely to do

00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:03.195
solicitive courting
gestures with him.

00:39:03.195 --> 00:39:06.960
In other words, she's
jumping on a bandwagon.

00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:09.510
And this has now been shown
in a number of species.

00:39:09.510 --> 00:39:11.185
What's the logic of this?

00:39:11.185 --> 00:39:14.090
This is exactly what secondary
sexual characteristics

00:39:14.090 --> 00:39:14.930
are about.

00:39:14.930 --> 00:39:17.270
I don't understand
why anyone considers

00:39:17.270 --> 00:39:18.550
that to be attractive.

00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:20.740
This individual
does nothing for me.

00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:24.820
But if it appears to be the
case that those traits are very

00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:27.990
popular, and thus those
traits are predictors

00:39:27.990 --> 00:39:30.470
of being able to pass on
many copies of your genes,

00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:32.960
I sure want my kids
to have those traits.

00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:36.060
And thus this bandwagon effect.

00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:39.180
So all of these are
versions of just shallow,

00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:41.470
shallow,
horrible-values versions

00:39:41.470 --> 00:39:43.000
of who one looks for in a mate.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:46.110
But then, of course, we go to
all the pair-bonding species.

00:39:46.110 --> 00:39:48.350
And as we heard from
many lectures ago,

00:39:48.350 --> 00:39:51.720
the rituals in lots of those
species of male courtship

00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:55.740
built around showing that
they are a competent parent.

00:39:55.740 --> 00:39:59.100
Showing that they can do some
rough approximation of acting

00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:00.800
like a mother to these babies.

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:01.890
What's that about?

00:40:01.890 --> 00:40:05.490
And that's the whole world
of male birds doing courtship

00:40:05.490 --> 00:40:09.350
by bringing worms and feeding
the mother and showing, look,

00:40:09.350 --> 00:40:10.970
I know what kind
of things we eat.

00:40:10.970 --> 00:40:12.480
I know how to bring a worm.

00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:16.010
By the time you get to
pair-bonding species,

00:40:16.010 --> 00:40:19.160
the rituals and what is
attractive are often markers

00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:23.190
not of fertility but of
parenting skill-- parenting

00:40:23.190 --> 00:40:24.490
competence.

00:40:24.490 --> 00:40:28.590
Flipped the other way, in
most nonhuman primate species

00:40:28.590 --> 00:40:30.850
that have been looked
at, when are females

00:40:30.850 --> 00:40:34.070
most attractive to males,
independent of the size

00:40:34.070 --> 00:40:35.450
of their estrus swelling?

00:40:35.450 --> 00:40:38.170
When they've already
had a couple of kids.

00:40:38.170 --> 00:40:41.540
Females, the first-time-out
rounds of ovulating,

00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:43.480
are less preferred
than females who have

00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:45.070
had a number of kids already.

00:40:45.070 --> 00:40:48.930
If it is the same thing going
on, what she has already proven

00:40:48.930 --> 00:40:51.140
is she's competent
enough that she didn't

00:40:51.140 --> 00:40:52.880
kill the kids by
dropping them out

00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:54.530
of the tree at various points.

00:40:54.530 --> 00:40:59.110
This being as a marker,
again, of competence.

00:40:59.110 --> 00:40:59.880
OK.

00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:03.120
Final realm of what one
looks for in a mate,

00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:05.370
across lots and lots
of different species.

00:41:05.370 --> 00:41:07.910
Which is not only
someone who appears

00:41:07.910 --> 00:41:10.690
healthy and symmetrical,
and these exciting secondary

00:41:10.690 --> 00:41:14.210
characteristics that are
markers of lots of fertility,

00:41:14.210 --> 00:41:16.990
and also whatever everybody
else thinks is attractive,

00:41:16.990 --> 00:41:19.450
you suddenly do as well--
the last thing that

00:41:19.450 --> 00:41:22.250
tends to be a theme through
lots and lots of species,

00:41:22.250 --> 00:41:24.270
and in every human
culture, is being

00:41:24.270 --> 00:41:29.350
attracted to someone who's
kind of just like you are.

00:41:29.350 --> 00:41:31.990
Being attracted to
someone who is similar.

00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:35.250
And the term for
this is "homogamy."

00:41:35.250 --> 00:41:39.050
Homogamy, polygamy, monogamy.

00:41:39.050 --> 00:41:42.330
In this case, homogamy--
mating with someone

00:41:42.330 --> 00:41:47.770
who is homogeneous, who is
similar in traits of yours.

00:41:47.770 --> 00:41:51.510
And across cultures, including
in the United States,

00:41:51.510 --> 00:41:56.590
people are extremely homogamous
in who they wind up marrying.

00:41:56.590 --> 00:41:59.250
Here are the statistics.

00:41:59.250 --> 00:42:01.770
When you look at
couples in this country,

00:42:01.770 --> 00:42:05.850
there is better than a
90%-chance likelihood of them

00:42:05.850 --> 00:42:09.980
sharing the same religion, of
being within three years of age

00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:13.420
of each other, of sharing the
same race-- the ethnicity--

00:42:13.420 --> 00:42:17.220
sharing the socioeconomic
status of their childhood--

00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:20.400
did they both grow up
poor, wealthy, whatever--

00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:22.400
and sharing political views.

00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:25.610
More than 90% concordance
in this country

00:42:25.610 --> 00:42:29.440
on those traits-- markers
of homogamous preference

00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:31.330
for someone who
is just like you.

00:42:31.330 --> 00:42:35.820
Stepping down a bit-- not in
this range-- but more than 40%

00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:39.730
homogamy for a couple
having IQs that are within,

00:42:39.730 --> 00:42:42.150
I don't know, five points
of each other-- having

00:42:42.150 --> 00:42:44.400
similar levels of education.

00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:46.820
Those are very
homogamous traits.

00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:49.000
Then a whole bunch
of weirdo minor ones

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:52.360
which, nonetheless, are still
statistically significant.

00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:57.470
A 20% to 40%
likelihood of couples

00:42:57.470 --> 00:42:59.940
being the same height--
not the same height,

00:42:59.940 --> 00:43:02.195
but say, for example,
in the top 10

00:43:02.195 --> 00:43:05.090
percentile of height
for their sex-- scaled

00:43:05.090 --> 00:43:06.670
to what's within gender.

00:43:06.670 --> 00:43:08.530
Weight, hair color.

00:43:08.530 --> 00:43:13.560
And then you get into this
bizarre world of lung capacity,

00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:17.200
of width of nostrils,
of width of eyes.

00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:20.180
People have studied these,
and these are traits

00:43:20.180 --> 00:43:22.450
that show significant homogamy.

00:43:22.450 --> 00:43:25.790
In this fairly low range,
but nonetheless significant

00:43:25.790 --> 00:43:27.430
at a higher-than-expected rate.

00:43:27.430 --> 00:43:30.230
What are these weird
things being about?

00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:32.110
These are probably
surrogate markers

00:43:32.110 --> 00:43:36.070
for preferring people of
similar race, similar ethnicity.

00:43:36.070 --> 00:43:39.210
That's probably where those
numbers are coming from.

00:43:39.210 --> 00:43:40.960
So what's this about?

00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:44.100
This is suddenly barreling
us back into the world

00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:46.680
from many lectures
ago of, you don't

00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:48.560
want to mate with
someone who shares

00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:51.780
half their genes with you--
the dangers of inbreeding.

00:43:51.780 --> 00:43:53.910
But you also don't
necessarily want

00:43:53.910 --> 00:43:56.400
to mate with someone who
is so unrelated that there

00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:59.540
is no drive of kin
selection for cooperation.

00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:03.340
We have now heard, from
bird species to humans,

00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:05.580
you get the optimal
fertility somewhere

00:44:05.580 --> 00:44:07.830
around third to fourth cousins.

00:44:07.830 --> 00:44:11.280
You get the optimal
fertility, under circumstances

00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:14.120
that select for a fair
degree of homogamy

00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:16.120
across different cultures.

00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:19.930
And historically, this
is no surprise at all--

00:44:19.930 --> 00:44:22.930
that there is a great
deal of homogamy.

00:44:22.930 --> 00:44:26.170
Various studies have shown
that your average traditional

00:44:26.170 --> 00:44:28.360
hunter-gatherer winds
up being married

00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:31.450
to somebody who grew up
less than 40 kilometers away

00:44:31.450 --> 00:44:32.630
from them.

00:44:32.630 --> 00:44:35.510
Studies show that people
in traditional agricultural

00:44:35.510 --> 00:44:37.750
villages in the
developing world wind up

00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:40.520
being married to someone,
on the average, less than 10

00:44:40.520 --> 00:44:42.320
kilometers away from them.

00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:45.890
You are getting an awful
lot of people winding up

00:44:45.890 --> 00:44:49.220
being married with individuals
who look a lot like them.

00:44:49.220 --> 00:44:53.300
And back to that issue
of partial relatedness--

00:44:53.300 --> 00:44:54.590
third to fourth cousins.

00:44:54.590 --> 00:44:55.516
Yes.

00:44:55.516 --> 00:44:58.550
But couldn't it just be that
I know a lot more people who

00:44:58.550 --> 00:45:01.035
are the same age as
me, the same race,

00:45:01.035 --> 00:45:04.020
the same socioeconomic
status, and so on?

00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:07.430
OK, well, though,
look around the room.

00:45:07.430 --> 00:45:10.330
This is a very
heterogeneous corner

00:45:10.330 --> 00:45:12.440
of the planet we've
come up with, here.

00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:14.010
Yes, it's very
different when you

00:45:14.010 --> 00:45:16.460
look in more homogeneous
societies, there.

00:45:16.460 --> 00:45:19.460
But when you begin to look
at the increasingly diverse

00:45:19.460 --> 00:45:22.060
Western European ones,
you see a fair amount

00:45:22.060 --> 00:45:24.580
of homogamy going on.

00:45:24.580 --> 00:45:26.580
Very interesting data.

00:45:26.580 --> 00:45:29.740
Iceland-- yet another of
our good-old Scandinavian--

00:45:29.740 --> 00:45:31.680
is Iceland technically
Scandinavian?

00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:33.470
Or are they just,
like, good guys

00:45:33.470 --> 00:45:34.960
who should be Scandinavians?

00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:38.801
They're so dull and
healthy and sensible.

00:45:38.801 --> 00:45:39.300
OK.

00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:42.660
So in those sensible,
non-Scandinavian Icelandics,

00:45:42.660 --> 00:45:45.350
who have, like-- I
don't know, what?

00:45:45.350 --> 00:45:48.000
--300,000 people in the whole
country, and all of them

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:51.540
are no more than sixth
cousins apart, and all of them

00:45:51.540 --> 00:45:55.520
have just fanatically clean
records, going back centuries,

00:45:55.520 --> 00:45:57.700
as to who was married
to who, studies

00:45:57.700 --> 00:46:01.280
have now been done, looking
over the course of 200 years,

00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:06.040
in Iceland of how closely
related different couples were.

00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:10.360
And what you see is, optimal
fertility, optimal number

00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:13.640
of children who
survived into adulthood,

00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:17.130
you get from third- to
fourth-cousin marriages.

00:46:17.130 --> 00:46:19.990
Recent studies showing that.

00:46:19.990 --> 00:46:22.200
One additional,
interesting version

00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:26.550
of this homogamy stuff, which
is, in the United States

00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:28.710
you see something
slightly different.

00:46:28.710 --> 00:46:31.310
You see an age factor
coming in here,

00:46:31.310 --> 00:46:37.040
which is, people are more likely
to make less homogamous choices

00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:42.010
as to their mates, the younger
they are when they get married.

00:46:42.010 --> 00:46:44.070
What's that a surrogate for?

00:46:44.070 --> 00:46:47.110
The incredibly depressing
fact that, on the average,

00:46:47.110 --> 00:46:49.290
people get more and
more closed-minded

00:46:49.290 --> 00:46:50.560
as they get older.

00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:54.330
You see the greatest
heterogamy in marriages--

00:46:54.330 --> 00:46:57.480
the greatest likelihood
of people marrying someone

00:46:57.480 --> 00:47:00.330
with a very different
background, the younger they

00:47:00.330 --> 00:47:00.830
are.

00:47:00.830 --> 00:47:03.460
In the early 20s is
when you find the peak

00:47:03.460 --> 00:47:06.590
for a lot of these traits-- when
you find the least homogamy.

00:47:06.590 --> 00:47:11.400
One interesting exception to
that, or a partial exception,

00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:12.970
which is with religion.

00:47:12.970 --> 00:47:17.200
And what you see is, you
look at people getting

00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:18.890
married in their early 20s.

00:47:18.890 --> 00:47:20.850
This is the likelihood
of marrying somebody

00:47:20.850 --> 00:47:22.250
from a different religion.

00:47:22.250 --> 00:47:26.030
And then it goes way
down in the 30s and 40s.

00:47:26.030 --> 00:47:29.210
And somewhere between
50 and 60, there's

00:47:29.210 --> 00:47:31.060
another little
blip that goes up.

00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:33.960
And this has been documented
in a number of studies.

00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:36.680
What's that blip about?

00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:39.910
Any theories?

00:47:39.910 --> 00:47:42.606
Oh-- OK, somebody
[INAUDIBLE] there.

00:47:42.606 --> 00:47:45.100
Um-- fewer options for mates?

00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:46.900
Fewer options for mates.

00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:49.380
That's one depressing
possibility.

00:47:49.380 --> 00:47:53.550
And just wait until you're in
the nursing home and, like,

00:47:53.550 --> 00:47:55.460
anything that moves
you imprint on.

00:47:55.460 --> 00:47:56.965
Yes, theory?

00:47:56.965 --> 00:47:58.590
They're not going to
have kids anymore,

00:47:58.590 --> 00:48:00.510
so they don't need to
worry about passing down

00:48:00.510 --> 00:48:01.593
[INAUDIBLE] to their kids.

00:48:01.593 --> 00:48:02.200
OK.

00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:05.370
So the issue of-- if you
do that, if you have waited

00:48:05.370 --> 00:48:07.870
long enough that you're not
going to have kids, that you're

00:48:07.870 --> 00:48:09.810
not going to have
all these fights of,

00:48:09.810 --> 00:48:15.020
are you going to be a, you know,
a Mac family or a PC family

00:48:15.020 --> 00:48:17.670
or all those sorts of things
that can tear people apart

00:48:17.670 --> 00:48:18.370
[INAUDIBLE].

00:48:18.370 --> 00:48:19.624
OK, so that's a possibility.

00:48:19.624 --> 00:48:20.540
How about another one?

00:48:20.540 --> 00:48:21.040
Yeah.

00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:23.020
You're reflecting
your mortality.

00:48:23.020 --> 00:48:25.130
OK, you're reflecting
on mortality,

00:48:25.130 --> 00:48:28.850
and you're deciding,
enough of that nonsense.

00:48:28.850 --> 00:48:29.840
Who cares?

00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:32.580
This is someone who matters.

00:48:32.580 --> 00:48:33.920
Yes, that's a possibility.

00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:34.690
What else?

00:48:34.690 --> 00:48:35.410
Was that an idea?

00:48:35.410 --> 00:48:36.810
Midlife crisis?

00:48:36.810 --> 00:48:38.200
Midlife crisis.

00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:40.020
So it's either you
get a convertible

00:48:40.020 --> 00:48:44.190
or you marry someone
from, you know,

00:48:44.190 --> 00:48:46.260
Tierra Del Fuego or something.

00:48:46.260 --> 00:48:48.260
So all of those
seem to go into it.

00:48:48.260 --> 00:48:51.550
One additional one, which
I find to be absolutely,

00:48:51.550 --> 00:48:54.990
like, wonderful, in terms
of just how bizarre it is.

00:48:54.990 --> 00:48:57.190
Which is, when they
interview people,

00:48:57.190 --> 00:49:00.910
what you also see is, the ones
who tend to have this peak,

00:49:00.910 --> 00:49:03.140
they have been in
long-term relationships

00:49:03.140 --> 00:49:05.090
with the individual.

00:49:05.090 --> 00:49:06.540
What was that about?

00:49:06.540 --> 00:49:09.240
They're waiting for
their parents to die,

00:49:09.240 --> 00:49:11.653
so they don't kill them
by marrying this person.

00:49:11.653 --> 00:49:12.380
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:12.380 --> 00:49:15.160
That appears to be
part of that scenario.

00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:19.160
Which is, once they're dead,
then we can go get married.

00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:21.960
Because I couldn't possibly
do this to them before then.

00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:25.950
And that appears to be
part of this peak, also.

00:49:25.950 --> 00:49:26.500
OK.

00:49:26.500 --> 00:49:30.350
Finally-- finally, a
study-- famous study

00:49:30.350 --> 00:49:32.150
that was done
about 15 years ago,

00:49:32.150 --> 00:49:35.340
by an evolutionary biologist
named David Buss, who's

00:49:35.340 --> 00:49:37.190
now at the University of Texas.

00:49:37.190 --> 00:49:38.190
He wasn't, at the time.

00:49:38.190 --> 00:49:40.330
And he did one of
these sorts of studies

00:49:40.330 --> 00:49:45.660
that we recognize by now, which
is sort of questioning people,

00:49:45.660 --> 00:49:49.530
questionnaires of people from
a lot of different cultures,

00:49:49.530 --> 00:49:51.170
all over the planet.

00:49:51.170 --> 00:49:55.589
And this was this massive study
of I don't remember how many

00:49:55.589 --> 00:49:56.380
different cultures.

00:49:56.380 --> 00:49:59.800
But it ranged from
non-westernized, nomadic

00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:02.890
pastoralists, non-westernized
agriculturalists,

00:50:02.890 --> 00:50:07.050
socialist countries, communist
ones, capitalist ones--

00:50:07.050 --> 00:50:10.450
everything in between--
individualistic societies,

00:50:10.450 --> 00:50:12.500
communalist societies--
all of that.

00:50:12.500 --> 00:50:15.180
It was tens of thousands
of people in the study.

00:50:15.180 --> 00:50:18.710
Where he gave all these
people a list of traits.

00:50:18.710 --> 00:50:21.090
And he would say,
which of these traits

00:50:21.090 --> 00:50:24.640
are most important to you,
in terms of who you marry?

00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:27.540
And what came out in
every single culture

00:50:27.540 --> 00:50:30.230
looked at-- as follows.

00:50:30.230 --> 00:50:33.370
In every culture
looked at, women

00:50:33.370 --> 00:50:39.570
are more likely than men to want
a mate who is older than them.

00:50:39.570 --> 00:50:43.880
In every culture looked at,
men, more common than women,

00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:47.780
looking for someone
who's younger than them.

00:50:47.780 --> 00:50:52.440
In every culture looked
at, women more than men

00:50:52.440 --> 00:50:56.310
citing the economic
prowess of this individual

00:50:56.310 --> 00:50:58.410
as being part of
what constitutes

00:50:58.410 --> 00:51:01.720
the desirable traits.

00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:04.580
In every one of them
that's been looked at,

00:51:04.580 --> 00:51:08.830
men having a greater preference
than women for markers-- health

00:51:08.830 --> 00:51:13.160
markers-- of fertility in the
person they would wind up with.

00:51:13.160 --> 00:51:16.250
This was so depressing,
because this

00:51:16.250 --> 00:51:19.500
is every culture on this planet
coming up with this cliche.

00:51:19.500 --> 00:51:21.790
Everybody learned
about the study,

00:51:21.790 --> 00:51:24.780
and how remarkably
disturbing it was

00:51:24.780 --> 00:51:28.390
in terms of all of those
stereotypes across so

00:51:28.390 --> 00:51:29.820
many different cultures.

00:51:29.820 --> 00:51:33.490
Women are looking for older
guys who have lots of money,

00:51:33.490 --> 00:51:36.300
and men are looking for
younger women with big hips

00:51:36.300 --> 00:51:37.390
or who knows what.

00:51:37.390 --> 00:51:40.470
And this came through
in every single culture.

00:51:40.470 --> 00:51:42.710
But what everybody
always misses when

00:51:42.710 --> 00:51:45.900
they discuss this study
was one additional one.

00:51:45.900 --> 00:51:48.400
And this is, like,
enough for, like,

00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:50.450
Hallmark cards-- all of that.

00:51:50.450 --> 00:51:53.280
What everybody knows is,
across these cultures,

00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:55.750
these traits were more
likely to be rated

00:51:55.750 --> 00:51:58.240
highly by one sex
versus the other,

00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:01.620
but in every single one of
the countries, what you find

00:52:01.620 --> 00:52:05.100
is both sexes had an equal
preference for the number

00:52:05.100 --> 00:52:08.270
one thing on the list, which
is winding up with somebody

00:52:08.270 --> 00:52:11.670
who's nice to them.

00:52:11.670 --> 00:52:12.180
OK.

00:52:12.180 --> 00:52:15.100
On that note,
let's take a break.

00:52:15.100 --> 00:52:17.730
We now switch to
our next second half

00:52:17.730 --> 00:52:20.110
of the course topic,
which is going to follow

00:52:20.110 --> 00:52:22.044
the exact same strategy.

00:52:22.044 --> 00:52:23.460
And where we're
shifting to, here,

00:52:23.460 --> 00:52:26.780
is going to be a whole bunch
of lectures on the large,

00:52:26.780 --> 00:52:29.030
sprawling,
interconnected subjects

00:52:29.030 --> 00:52:34.470
of aggression, violence,
competition, cooperation,

00:52:34.470 --> 00:52:35.450
empathy.

00:52:35.450 --> 00:52:38.080
And what we will be
doing there is wrestling

00:52:38.080 --> 00:52:42.440
with all sorts of features
of the complexities of these

00:52:42.440 --> 00:52:44.690
and where the
underlying biology is--

00:52:44.690 --> 00:52:48.180
enormously important
social implications,

00:52:48.180 --> 00:52:49.780
in a lot of these cases.

00:52:49.780 --> 00:52:52.000
And, of course, what we
need to start off with

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:54.410
is, what's the behavior about?

00:52:54.410 --> 00:52:56.980
How objectively do you
describe these things?

00:52:56.980 --> 00:53:00.160
And it struck me-- a good way of
starting that, not only giving

00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:03.540
a sense of the range of
what aggression can be like,

00:53:03.540 --> 00:53:07.210
but also a very important point
that's going to come through

00:53:07.210 --> 00:53:09.700
in this entire lecture-- it
struck me that a good thing

00:53:09.700 --> 00:53:13.760
to be would be to describe a
relatively recent exposure I

00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:15.370
had to human aggression.

00:53:15.370 --> 00:53:18.860
Which was me being
aggressive to somebody else.

00:53:18.860 --> 00:53:20.890
This was, now, a
couple of years ago,

00:53:20.890 --> 00:53:22.730
before my back
disintegrated on me.

00:53:22.730 --> 00:53:25.320
I used to play soccer
two, three times a week.

00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:28.050
And I had been doing
this for decades.

00:53:28.050 --> 00:53:32.070
And I'm actually
totally lousy at soccer.

00:53:32.070 --> 00:53:35.560
And, like, I'm short
and I'm old and I'm not

00:53:35.560 --> 00:53:36.890
particularly coordinated.

00:53:36.890 --> 00:53:38.800
And [INAUDIBLE].

00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:41.300
So this has never
been something that

00:53:41.300 --> 00:53:44.330
was, like, one of the things I
was going to go to the Olympics

00:53:44.330 --> 00:53:44.880
with.

00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:47.870
So, a number of years ago,
there was consistently

00:53:47.870 --> 00:53:49.690
this one guy who seemed
to always wind up

00:53:49.690 --> 00:53:52.380
on the other side, and who
somehow always wound up

00:53:52.380 --> 00:53:56.040
guarding me, who was a
total son of a bitch.

00:53:56.040 --> 00:53:59.710
This guy, he was-- he was
a lot younger than me,

00:53:59.710 --> 00:54:02.330
and he was a lot more athletic,
and he was a lot taller

00:54:02.330 --> 00:54:04.660
than me, and he was a lot
more skillful in this game.

00:54:04.660 --> 00:54:08.150
And, on top of everything else,
he was a really dirty player.

00:54:08.150 --> 00:54:09.737
And this was driving me crazy.

00:54:09.737 --> 00:54:11.320
Every time the ball
would get near me,

00:54:11.320 --> 00:54:14.050
he would elbow me in my ear,
and he would do something like--

00:54:14.050 --> 00:54:14.550
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:14.550 --> 00:54:16.133
--that he wasn't
supposed to be doing.

00:54:16.133 --> 00:54:16.870
That sort.

00:54:16.870 --> 00:54:20.100
And one day, we
were out playing,

00:54:20.100 --> 00:54:22.900
and somebody passed
the ball to me.

00:54:22.900 --> 00:54:24.840
And, as per usual,
he effortlessly

00:54:24.840 --> 00:54:28.030
knocked me out of the way--
crudely and illegally,

00:54:28.030 --> 00:54:30.600
which no one seemed to notice--
and then stole the ball.

00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:33.100
And I was pissed.

00:54:33.100 --> 00:54:36.960
And this guy quickly
passed it to someone else.

00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:39.270
And the two of us
were sort of running

00:54:39.270 --> 00:54:40.750
towards a corner of the field.

00:54:40.750 --> 00:54:42.870
And momentum was carrying us.

00:54:42.870 --> 00:54:46.210
And I sort of realized
that the ball was now

00:54:46.210 --> 00:54:49.630
kind of elsewhere in the field,
and thus everybody's attention

00:54:49.630 --> 00:54:51.840
was kind of elsewhere
in the field.

00:54:51.840 --> 00:54:54.480
So we're running along, and I'm,
like, a half step behind him,

00:54:54.480 --> 00:54:57.040
and I just stick my foot
in front of his ankle

00:54:57.040 --> 00:54:58.494
and send him rolling and--

00:54:58.494 --> 00:54:59.910
[LAUGHTER AND SCATTERED
 APPLAUSE]

00:54:59.910 --> 00:55:03.190
--sprawling, and this
was the best-- heaven.

00:55:03.190 --> 00:55:04.590
This was during the summer.

00:55:04.590 --> 00:55:06.780
And it turned out there
was a mud hole there.

00:55:06.780 --> 00:55:08.910
It hadn't rained in six months.

00:55:08.910 --> 00:55:10.550
This was wonderful!

00:55:10.550 --> 00:55:13.880
So he goes-- and I didn't even
go through the pretense of, oh,

00:55:13.880 --> 00:55:14.660
are you OK?

00:55:14.660 --> 00:55:15.540
Sorry about that.

00:55:15.540 --> 00:55:17.015
It was just-- yeah!

00:55:17.015 --> 00:55:18.990
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:18.990 --> 00:55:21.870
I had to restrain
myself from ripping

00:55:21.870 --> 00:55:24.790
his stomach open with my
canines, at that point.

00:55:24.790 --> 00:55:26.797
So I felt wonderful!

00:55:26.797 --> 00:55:28.255
This was, like,
the best thing that

00:55:28.255 --> 00:55:29.620
had happened to me in months.

00:55:29.620 --> 00:55:32.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:32.680 --> 00:55:34.570
Nelson Mandela.

00:55:34.570 --> 00:55:35.950
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:35.950 --> 00:55:37.360
Nelson Mandela.

00:55:37.360 --> 00:55:41.750
Now in his 92nd
year, frail-- frail.

00:55:41.750 --> 00:55:45.380
An icon of all that is good
and wonderful about humans.

00:55:45.380 --> 00:55:47.470
This man on his last legs, now.

00:55:47.470 --> 00:55:50.700
What if I had been playing
soccer with Nelson Mandela

00:55:50.700 --> 00:55:52.500
and I did that to him?

00:55:52.500 --> 00:55:54.470
You'd be horrified!

00:55:54.470 --> 00:55:57.890
Nobody would be on the edge of
applauding that sort of thing.

00:55:57.890 --> 00:56:00.120
This would be
unspeakable, if I had

00:56:00.120 --> 00:56:03.880
done that to delightful
Nelson Mandela at age 92.

00:56:03.880 --> 00:56:07.230
So what we see here is
a very important thing

00:56:07.230 --> 00:56:09.860
that is going to run
through all of this topic.

00:56:09.860 --> 00:56:14.550
Which is, very little about
the social, the environmental,

00:56:14.550 --> 00:56:17.450
the learning aspects
of aggression

00:56:17.450 --> 00:56:21.080
have to do with learning
how to be aggressive.

00:56:21.080 --> 00:56:23.130
It's all about when.

00:56:23.130 --> 00:56:27.250
It's all about the appropriate
social context for it.

00:56:27.250 --> 00:56:29.340
Because that speaks
to something that

00:56:29.340 --> 00:56:32.850
is absolutely clear
for 99.9% of us.

00:56:32.850 --> 00:56:35.610
We do not want a world
without violence.

00:56:35.610 --> 00:56:37.760
We love violence.

00:56:37.760 --> 00:56:39.530
We get excited by it.

00:56:39.530 --> 00:56:42.550
We will pay good money
to see the right displays

00:56:42.550 --> 00:56:43.990
of competitive violence.

00:56:43.990 --> 00:56:46.130
We will barely
restrain ourselves

00:56:46.130 --> 00:56:47.750
from leaping in and joining it.

00:56:47.750 --> 00:56:50.190
It is all so wonderful
and exciting.

00:56:50.190 --> 00:56:53.660
We love violence-- when
it's the right kind.

00:56:53.660 --> 00:56:56.000
When it's in the right context.

00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:58.160
And a huge percentage
of wrestling

00:56:58.160 --> 00:57:01.390
with this is built around the
fact that, in some settings,

00:57:01.390 --> 00:57:06.010
the exact same behavior gets
you medals, gets you promotions,

00:57:06.010 --> 00:57:08.620
gets you differential
reproductive success.

00:57:08.620 --> 00:57:12.210
And the exact same patterns of
what you do with your muscles

00:57:12.210 --> 00:57:15.250
in another setting is some
of the worst things you could

00:57:15.250 --> 00:57:16.840
do as a human to another human.

00:57:16.840 --> 00:57:18.850
And it's the same behavior.

00:57:18.850 --> 00:57:21.010
And what we're going to
be wrestling with, over

00:57:21.010 --> 00:57:23.880
and over and over, in the
subject, as we march back,

00:57:23.880 --> 00:57:28.770
here, is this whole issue of,
very little about the biology

00:57:28.770 --> 00:57:31.900
of violence,
competition, all of that,

00:57:31.900 --> 00:57:34.620
is about how to
do the behaviors.

00:57:34.620 --> 00:57:37.560
It is all about
appropriate context.

00:57:37.560 --> 00:57:39.340
And what we will
see is, all sorts

00:57:39.340 --> 00:57:41.950
of realms of neurological
diseases, where things

00:57:41.950 --> 00:57:46.820
go majorly wrong, in terms
of control against violence--

00:57:46.820 --> 00:57:50.570
very rarely will it be that it's
the magnitude of violence which

00:57:50.570 --> 00:57:51.300
is wrong.

00:57:51.300 --> 00:57:53.920
What you see is, it's
in the wrong context.

00:57:53.920 --> 00:57:56.500
Because if it's done
right we love it,

00:57:56.500 --> 00:57:58.870
and we elect people who
have been good at it,

00:57:58.870 --> 00:58:02.280
and we differentially mate with
them, and we pay to see it.

00:58:02.280 --> 00:58:04.270
It's got to be in
the right setting.

00:58:04.270 --> 00:58:07.510
There are very few of us who
viscerally are truly, truly

00:58:07.510 --> 00:58:10.100
pacifists, all across the board.

00:58:10.100 --> 00:58:13.570
We just don't like violence
in certain settings.

00:58:13.570 --> 00:58:15.240
So that will be part
of the challenge,

00:58:15.240 --> 00:58:18.930
here-- making sense of the
biology of social context.

00:58:18.930 --> 00:58:20.410
And we've already
gotten some hints

00:58:20.410 --> 00:58:23.140
about that in the last topic.

00:58:23.140 --> 00:58:26.270
So, of course, what we
have to start off with

00:58:26.270 --> 00:58:27.450
is, like, definitions.

00:58:27.450 --> 00:58:29.250
And it's never
more in this realm

00:58:29.250 --> 00:58:31.320
that you get the "I don't
know how to define it,

00:58:31.320 --> 00:58:32.820
but I know it when
I see it" sort

00:58:32.820 --> 00:58:35.930
of notion in dealing with terms
for aggression and violence.

00:58:35.930 --> 00:58:38.190
Probably a great
starting point is,

00:58:38.190 --> 00:58:40.860
just as with the
sexual-behavior subject,

00:58:40.860 --> 00:58:43.600
starting off with,
well, what aspects

00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:47.520
of violence and aggression
are unique to humans?

00:58:47.520 --> 00:58:51.210
And what the theme has been
there, for decades now,

00:58:51.210 --> 00:58:54.580
is all sorts of domains that
used to be thought to be

00:58:54.580 --> 00:58:57.400
unique to humans no longer are.

00:58:57.400 --> 00:58:59.220
We've already heard
some of these examples,

00:58:59.220 --> 00:59:01.940
way back in the
sociobiology lectures--

00:59:01.940 --> 00:59:05.230
all of those wildlife films
where, somewhere in there,

00:59:05.230 --> 00:59:09.190
somebody with a very deep voice
has to intone about how "only

00:59:09.190 --> 00:59:13.090
man kills for pleasure"-- while
watching some beasts throwing

00:59:13.090 --> 00:59:14.950
the old wildebeest
into the river, there,

00:59:14.950 --> 00:59:16.290
and misinterpreting it.

00:59:16.290 --> 00:59:18.350
And that was always
the theme-- we're

00:59:18.350 --> 00:59:20.590
the only species that kills.

00:59:20.590 --> 00:59:23.300
And that went down the
tubes, way back when,

00:59:23.300 --> 00:59:27.720
as soon as people started
seeing competitive infanticide.

00:59:27.720 --> 00:59:29.700
That was first seen--
again, I think I

00:59:29.700 --> 00:59:31.760
mentioned-- in langur monkeys.

00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:34.015
A primatologist
named Sara Hrdy, who

00:59:34.015 --> 00:59:35.760
was at Harvard at
the time-- and she

00:59:35.760 --> 00:59:37.230
was the first to report this.

00:59:37.230 --> 00:59:39.440
And-- this could not be!

00:59:39.440 --> 00:59:42.940
That male langur monkeys
were killing babies?

00:59:42.940 --> 00:59:44.010
This was impossible.

00:59:44.010 --> 00:59:48.220
And the interpretation was that
this was a psychopathology.

00:59:48.220 --> 00:59:51.850
This was because of increasing
habitat degradation,

00:59:51.850 --> 00:59:55.480
human populations getting
closer, crowding them in.

00:59:55.480 --> 00:59:58.220
These were populations
of langur monkeys

00:59:58.220 --> 01:00:01.170
in some urban areas in India,
where she was studying them.

01:00:01.170 --> 01:00:05.800
This is not normal, because
no other species kills.

01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:08.350
And now that it's up to
20, 25 different species

01:00:08.350 --> 01:00:11.010
or so that does
competitive infanticide,

01:00:11.010 --> 01:00:14.420
it is quite clear we are not
the only species that kills.

01:00:14.420 --> 01:00:16.070
And we are not the
only species that

01:00:16.070 --> 01:00:21.120
kills in some premeditated,
strategic, Machiavellian,

01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:24.520
good for numbers of copies
of our genes kind of way.

01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:27.770
We are not the only
ones-- Jane Goodall

01:00:27.770 --> 01:00:31.850
by now having documented lots
and lots of cases of murder

01:00:31.850 --> 01:00:35.470
between chimps, females
killing each other's babies,

01:00:35.470 --> 01:00:38.410
males killing other
males quite frequently.

01:00:38.410 --> 01:00:41.630
And, once again, we are
not the only species.

01:00:41.630 --> 01:00:43.980
What's also become clear
from more recent work

01:00:43.980 --> 01:00:46.550
with chimpanzees is,
we're not the only species

01:00:46.550 --> 01:00:48.320
that makes weapons.

01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:52.170
Chimps have now been observed
to take large, heavy branches

01:00:52.170 --> 01:00:55.250
and break off the
ancillary branches,

01:00:55.250 --> 01:00:57.820
there, and smooth it out
and use it as a weapon,

01:00:57.820 --> 01:00:59.750
to try to hit another animal.

01:00:59.750 --> 01:01:03.630
This is tool use
and tool production.

01:01:03.630 --> 01:01:06.500
This is another species
making a weapon.

01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:10.900
We are also not the only species
that has organized violence.

01:01:10.900 --> 01:01:13.200
And this is back,
again, to chimps.

01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:15.490
Something mentioned way
back when in the lectures--

01:01:15.490 --> 01:01:18.740
the facts that chimps
are female-exogamous,

01:01:18.740 --> 01:01:20.650
that business that,
at puberty, it's

01:01:20.650 --> 01:01:23.930
the females who pick up and
move to a different group.

01:01:23.930 --> 01:01:26.910
All of the adult
males in a chimp group

01:01:26.910 --> 01:01:29.700
are relatively
related to each other.

01:01:29.700 --> 01:01:31.230
They are relatives.

01:01:31.230 --> 01:01:35.120
And what you get, then,
is cooperative aggression

01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:37.800
among males from a
particular group.

01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:40.900
What you will see
is border patrols.

01:01:40.900 --> 01:01:44.290
Goodall was the first to use
this term to describe it.

01:01:44.290 --> 01:01:46.000
You will get-- the
males of the group

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.960
will get into an
extremely agitated state

01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:52.680
with each other-- a state
of emotional contagion,

01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:57.940
where they build up this very
high level of excitation.

01:01:57.940 --> 01:02:02.300
And they then go and patrol the
territory between their group

01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:04.130
and the next group over.

01:02:04.130 --> 01:02:06.910
And what Goodall was the
first to document was,

01:02:06.910 --> 01:02:09.500
if they encounter a male
from the other group,

01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:11.160
they will kill him.

01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:16.250
And what she also documented was
cases of groups of male chimps

01:02:16.250 --> 01:02:20.560
systematically killing all of
the males of the neighboring

01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:21.610
group.

01:02:21.610 --> 01:02:24.740
What is it that we've just
seen, now, in another species?

01:02:24.740 --> 01:02:28.970
Genocide-- the notion of killing
an individual not because

01:02:28.970 --> 01:02:33.240
of who they are but because of
what group, what population,

01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:35.670
they belong to, as
part of a desire

01:02:35.670 --> 01:02:38.760
to eradicate a
population as a whole.

01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:41.240
We are not the only
species that has

01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:45.920
something resembling genocide,
if it's termed that way.

01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:49.940
So where is a domain
where we might be unique?

01:02:49.940 --> 01:02:52.450
Lots of people still
argue that humans

01:02:52.450 --> 01:02:55.940
are the only species that
psychopathologically confuse

01:02:55.940 --> 01:02:59.960
sexual behavior with aggressive
behavior-- world of sadism

01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:01.750
and masochism and all of that.

01:03:01.750 --> 01:03:03.930
That appears to be
something resembling

01:03:03.930 --> 01:03:06.920
a human-unique trait.

01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:07.560
OK.

01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:10.460
Now flipping to the more
cheerful side of things--

01:03:10.460 --> 01:03:12.730
the cooperation,
the empathy stuff--

01:03:12.730 --> 01:03:16.760
what aspects of those
behaviors are unique to humans?

01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:18.220
And what people
used to think was

01:03:18.220 --> 01:03:21.096
an exclusively human
ability-- yeah?

01:03:21.096 --> 01:03:25.082
Are there any instances where
certain troops of monkeys

01:03:25.082 --> 01:03:27.526
will not only just kill all
the males in a different troop

01:03:27.526 --> 01:03:29.986
but kill all females
and infants, too,

01:03:29.986 --> 01:03:31.960
as in [INAUDIBLE] genocide?

01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:32.490
Yeah.

01:03:32.490 --> 01:03:35.420
They will kill the infants,
out of competitive infanticide

01:03:35.420 --> 01:03:36.050
stuff.

01:03:36.050 --> 01:03:40.020
And they will then happily
hang with the females.

01:03:40.020 --> 01:03:43.640
And do more than
that, with any luck.

01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:47.290
In terms of-- oh, a very
familiar historical strategy

01:03:47.290 --> 01:03:51.100
with humans, seen
again and again.

01:03:51.100 --> 01:03:52.400
Good end of things.

01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:54.330
Used to be the rule
that the humans were

01:03:54.330 --> 01:03:58.030
the only species that
showed reconciliation-- that

01:03:58.030 --> 01:04:02.270
showed increased likelihood
of affiliative behavior

01:04:02.270 --> 01:04:05.040
between two individuals
after they have

01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:07.520
had an aggressive interaction.

01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:10.390
In the aftermath of
it, increased odds

01:04:10.390 --> 01:04:15.060
of doing something affiliative--
making up-- reconciling.

01:04:15.060 --> 01:04:16.960
Doing something
along those lines.

01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:19.390
And what has emerged
in the last 20 years

01:04:19.390 --> 01:04:24.090
or so is a huge literature
showing reconciliative behavior

01:04:24.090 --> 01:04:26.460
in a couple of
dozen other species.

01:04:26.460 --> 01:04:29.755
First person to report
this-- primatologist Frans de

01:04:29.755 --> 01:04:33.550
Waal, first reporting this
in rhesus monkeys, I believe.

01:04:33.550 --> 01:04:36.930
But lots of other species
since then, including

01:04:36.930 --> 01:04:39.310
dolphins, including whales.

01:04:39.310 --> 01:04:43.750
And what you see is-- in
the aftermath of a fight,

01:04:43.750 --> 01:04:47.840
you see two individuals are
more likely-- in gorillas,

01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:51.170
for example, to do social
grooming in the aftermath--

01:04:51.170 --> 01:04:52.560
than at any other time.

01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:56.930
An increased rate of that
happening-- reconciliation.

01:04:56.930 --> 01:05:00.620
What's remarkable is some
of the subtleties in it.

01:05:00.620 --> 01:05:04.340
And this was work that was done
by Marina Cords, at Columbia.

01:05:04.340 --> 01:05:08.320
And what she showed was,
the odds of reconciliation

01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:10.910
increase when it's
a more important,

01:05:10.910 --> 01:05:14.050
valuable relationship
that you have.

01:05:14.050 --> 01:05:16.610
How was she showing this?

01:05:16.610 --> 01:05:19.410
These were studies
with macaque monkeys.

01:05:19.410 --> 01:05:21.700
And what she did was
set up circumstances--

01:05:21.700 --> 01:05:24.970
these were animals
that were caged.

01:05:24.970 --> 01:05:27.180
And there were
circumstances where

01:05:27.180 --> 01:05:31.520
she put food on a tray outside
that could be reached for.

01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:33.900
Where, in one setting,
an animal could

01:05:33.900 --> 01:05:36.080
get the food in all on its own.

01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:37.790
And in another
setting, the only way

01:05:37.790 --> 01:05:40.570
to get the food tray
close enough to the cage

01:05:40.570 --> 01:05:42.640
was if both of them cooperated.

01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:44.890
And this was what they
were doing habitually.

01:05:44.890 --> 01:05:46.480
So what's the difference, there?

01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:48.420
In the second case,
you have formed

01:05:48.420 --> 01:05:51.780
this cooperative relationship
with this other individual.

01:05:51.780 --> 01:05:54.280
You need them, and they
need you to pull off

01:05:54.280 --> 01:05:56.590
this getting the food
close to the cage business.

01:05:56.590 --> 01:05:59.520
What she showed was
significantly higher rates

01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:01.950
of reconciliation
between pairs that

01:06:01.950 --> 01:06:04.440
have a history of cooperating.

01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:06.530
What could that
be interpreted as?

01:06:06.530 --> 01:06:09.840
More of a game-theory
history of cooperation

01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:12.210
behind you-- more
willingness to forgive.

01:06:12.210 --> 01:06:14.770
Another way of framing it,
as she does in her work,

01:06:14.770 --> 01:06:17.830
is, this is a more valuable
relationship that you

01:06:17.830 --> 01:06:19.260
don't want to screw up.

01:06:19.260 --> 01:06:22.540
You are more willing to do
something reconciliative

01:06:22.540 --> 01:06:24.200
afterward.

01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:28.330
You can see, in baboons,
reconciling behavior

01:06:28.330 --> 01:06:29.710
in females.

01:06:29.710 --> 01:06:32.370
No male baboons ever reconcile.

01:06:32.370 --> 01:06:34.690
Showing gender
differences, there.

01:06:34.690 --> 01:06:37.840
In bonobos, you
see reconciliation

01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:40.090
is different from all
these other species, where,

01:06:40.090 --> 01:06:43.314
in all the other ones, it's
built around social grooming

01:06:43.314 --> 01:06:45.770
or chimp hugs or whatever.

01:06:45.770 --> 01:06:48.710
There, of course, as you
guessed it, it's sex.

01:06:48.710 --> 01:06:50.230
Because with the
bonobos, anything

01:06:50.230 --> 01:06:52.860
that happens, and
it's time to have sex.

01:06:52.860 --> 01:06:54.730
But an interesting
thing, in terms

01:06:54.730 --> 01:06:58.940
of this picture of bonobos
being this incredibly peaceful

01:06:58.940 --> 01:07:02.810
species out there in this
commune and all of that--

01:07:02.810 --> 01:07:06.840
you can't have reconciliation
unless you have aggression.

01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:08.600
They do have aggressive
interactions.

01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:11.680
Otherwise, there would be
nothing to reconcile afterward.

01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:15.900
Even the beatific bonobos have
a certain degree of aggression--

01:07:15.900 --> 01:07:19.640
very high and varied
rates, varied abilities,

01:07:19.640 --> 01:07:23.340
to pull off reconciliative
behavior afterward.

01:07:23.340 --> 01:07:25.900
More things that used
to be just about us.

01:07:25.900 --> 01:07:27.030
Empathy.

01:07:27.030 --> 01:07:30.180
And a literature now coming
out, showing the building

01:07:30.180 --> 01:07:33.050
blocks of that in
other species, as well.

01:07:33.050 --> 01:07:38.670
First example in chimps,
second example in lab rats.

01:07:38.670 --> 01:07:39.550
Chimp example.

01:07:39.550 --> 01:07:42.280
Again, this was work
done by Frans de Waal.

01:07:42.280 --> 01:07:43.760
And wonderful study.

01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:46.270
What he showed were
two circumstances

01:07:46.270 --> 01:07:48.430
where a male chimp
would get pummeled.

01:07:48.430 --> 01:07:50.000
First circumstance.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:54.340
You've got this low-ranking
male who goes up and threatens

01:07:54.340 --> 01:07:56.550
and starts a fight with
a higher-ranking male

01:07:56.550 --> 01:07:59.330
and gets pummeled
into the ground.

01:07:59.330 --> 01:08:00.700
Second circumstance.

01:08:00.700 --> 01:08:02.100
Low-ranking guy
is sitting there,

01:08:02.100 --> 01:08:03.310
minding his own business.

01:08:03.310 --> 01:08:05.260
High-ranking guy
is in a bad mood

01:08:05.260 --> 01:08:07.430
and pummels him into the ground.

01:08:07.430 --> 01:08:08.680
What's the difference?

01:08:08.680 --> 01:08:11.760
In the first case,
this kid started it,

01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:12.985
by challenging the guy.

01:08:12.985 --> 01:08:16.750
And in the second case, he
was an innocent bystander.

01:08:16.750 --> 01:08:19.490
And what de Waal showed
is, in the half hour

01:08:19.490 --> 01:08:23.310
after these incidents, the ones
who were innocent bystanders

01:08:23.310 --> 01:08:27.300
were far more likely to be
groomed by females there

01:08:27.300 --> 01:08:29.770
in the group than the
ones who had started it.

01:08:29.770 --> 01:08:33.550
They were able to distinguish
between not just that this

01:08:33.550 --> 01:08:35.810
is an individual
who just got pounded

01:08:35.810 --> 01:08:38.819
but whether it was their
fault or not, or whether they

01:08:38.819 --> 01:08:39.890
were a victim.

01:08:39.890 --> 01:08:43.430
And considerably more grooming
when it was an individual who

01:08:43.430 --> 01:08:44.670
had been a victim.

01:08:44.670 --> 01:08:49.200
Something resembling some
proto empathy happening, there.

01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:52.779
Remarkable study, published
in Science a couple years ago.

01:08:52.779 --> 01:08:54.040
A group from McGill.

01:08:54.040 --> 01:08:58.310
And what they showed was
arguing this is something

01:08:58.310 --> 01:09:00.850
resembling empathy in rats.

01:09:00.850 --> 01:09:03.430
Here's what they
showed in the study.

01:09:03.430 --> 01:09:08.585
What they had was, they-- let's
see, how were they doing that?

01:09:08.585 --> 01:09:11.689
They would have one rat
that was restrained.

01:09:11.689 --> 01:09:13.340
And rats don't like it.

01:09:13.340 --> 01:09:17.090
And they would be giving
off ultrasonic alarm calls.

01:09:17.090 --> 01:09:19.950
Now you put a second
rat, and you give them

01:09:19.950 --> 01:09:21.890
a pain-threshold test.

01:09:21.890 --> 01:09:25.240
Which is to say, you put them
on a perfectly cool surface,

01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:27.149
and you begin to
warm it up, and you

01:09:27.149 --> 01:09:29.520
see at what temperature
do they first

01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:31.224
lift up one of their paws.

01:09:31.224 --> 01:09:32.890
And, quick, take them
off at that point.

01:09:32.890 --> 01:09:35.069
And what is their
temperature threshold

01:09:35.069 --> 01:09:37.540
for beginning to
find this aversive?

01:09:37.540 --> 01:09:42.310
And what they showed was that
rats would have a lowered

01:09:42.310 --> 01:09:45.290
threshold, would be more
sensitive to this pain

01:09:45.290 --> 01:09:48.689
stimulus, if they were next
door to another rat giving off

01:09:48.689 --> 01:09:51.410
alarm vocalizations.

01:09:51.410 --> 01:09:53.490
But it was more
subtle than that.

01:09:53.490 --> 01:09:57.260
That would be easily described
in terms of, OK, alarm calls,

01:09:57.260 --> 01:10:00.600
and stressful, and just putting
me in a more agitated state.

01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:04.410
What they showed was,
this only worked when it

01:10:04.410 --> 01:10:06.460
was rats that were cagemates.

01:10:06.460 --> 01:10:09.010
If it's rats that knew
each other, hearing

01:10:09.010 --> 01:10:13.100
the other rat in distress made
you more sensitive to a pain

01:10:13.100 --> 01:10:14.060
stimulus.

01:10:14.060 --> 01:10:18.035
If it was a strange rat,
it didn't work at all.

01:10:18.035 --> 01:10:21.920
Some crude version of something
resembling empathy, there.

01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:24.680
So we're not the
only species with it.

01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:28.850
What's clear, though, is we
are the only species that

01:10:28.850 --> 01:10:30.900
could take it to
just domains that

01:10:30.900 --> 01:10:32.830
are utterly unrecognizable.

01:10:32.830 --> 01:10:35.180
We are the only
species that is moved

01:10:35.180 --> 01:10:37.760
by people on the other side
of the planet who have just

01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:39.440
been in some catastrophe.

01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:44.400
We are the only species moved by
artwork that depicts suffering,

01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:48.440
by movie characters, by
fictional characters in books.

01:10:48.440 --> 01:10:51.780
We are taken into realms
that are unmatched elsewhere.

01:10:51.780 --> 01:10:53.680
There's this wonderful video.

01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:56.990
This was an
advertisement for Ikea.

01:10:56.990 --> 01:11:00.996
Has anyone seen this one, where
the light gets thrown out?

01:11:00.996 --> 01:11:03.680
Is there anyone
who hasn't seen it?

01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:07.260
OK, this is-- opens up.

01:11:07.260 --> 01:11:11.920
It's this stormy, like,
dismal, drizzling night, there.

01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:13.510
And it's clearly freezing.

01:11:13.510 --> 01:11:15.400
And you see-- coming
into an apartment,

01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:17.960
you see an old
lamp sitting there,

01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:20.492
with sort of a
neck-type lamp thing.

01:11:20.492 --> 01:11:21.450
And it's sitting there.

01:11:21.450 --> 01:11:24.660
And suddenly this person
appears, picks it up,

01:11:24.660 --> 01:11:28.150
and walks outside into
the rain and puts it

01:11:28.150 --> 01:11:30.370
down next to the garbage can.

01:11:30.370 --> 01:11:30.900
Oh!

01:11:30.900 --> 01:11:32.310
It's being thrown out.

01:11:32.310 --> 01:11:35.750
And now, thanks to brilliant
photography and angles

01:11:35.750 --> 01:11:38.200
that are shot just
underneath the lamp,

01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:41.540
there, you see it leaning there,
looking miserable in the rain

01:11:41.540 --> 01:11:43.490
and all alone with its
light thing, there.

01:11:43.490 --> 01:11:45.770
And you see, from this
angle in the background,

01:11:45.770 --> 01:11:47.490
there's the
apartment, where it's

01:11:47.490 --> 01:11:49.720
warm-- lights, and all of that.

01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:52.370
And then you see the
most heartbreaking thing.

01:11:52.370 --> 01:11:55.670
You see the person come by the
window, there-- the armchair--

01:11:55.670 --> 01:12:00.290
and put down a new lamp--
a new lamp that's nicer.

01:12:00.290 --> 01:12:03.490
And they even show the person--
just to really get the edge,

01:12:03.490 --> 01:12:06.170
there-- briefly
caressing the new lamp.

01:12:06.170 --> 01:12:08.850
And then you get a shot
back out again in the dark,

01:12:08.850 --> 01:12:11.050
and it's pouring, and
it's drizzling out.

01:12:11.050 --> 01:12:13.300
And you're sitting
there, feeling terrible

01:12:13.300 --> 01:12:14.980
for this damned lamp, there.

01:12:14.980 --> 01:12:16.370
How does this work?

01:12:16.370 --> 01:12:19.250
And then, just to sort of
show it, suddenly this person

01:12:19.250 --> 01:12:21.560
appears in the screen
and says, in effect,

01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:22.820
what's wrong with you?

01:12:22.820 --> 01:12:24.010
It's a lamp.

01:12:24.010 --> 01:12:26.910
It's a lamp, and the
new one works better.

01:12:26.910 --> 01:12:29.890
And then on comes
"Ikea," which I suspect

01:12:29.890 --> 01:12:32.400
is not actually a good strategy,
because you think of them

01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:35.260
as heartless
individuals who advocate

01:12:35.260 --> 01:12:37.810
the abandonment of child lamps.

01:12:37.810 --> 01:12:41.192
But, like, no hippo
would know what

01:12:41.192 --> 01:12:43.400
the deal is, while you're
sitting there feeling sorry

01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:45.270
for this piece of metal, there.

01:12:45.270 --> 01:12:48.650
We have empathy--
not the only species,

01:12:48.650 --> 01:12:52.180
but in very distinct
and unique realms.

01:12:52.180 --> 01:12:53.780
What else?

01:12:53.780 --> 01:12:56.030
We are ostensibly
the only species

01:12:56.030 --> 01:12:57.810
with a sense of justice.

01:12:57.810 --> 01:13:01.070
Again, that's not
necessarily the case.

01:13:01.070 --> 01:13:04.320
Again, work by Frans de Waal,
whose name keeps coming up,

01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:07.600
who is one of the best,
most creative primatologists

01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:08.640
in the universe.

01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:13.000
This is work, now, where, again,
chimps-- two chimps-- where

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:14.850
circumstances were,
either it takes

01:13:14.850 --> 01:13:17.660
one of them to pull
a tray of food over,

01:13:17.660 --> 01:13:21.080
or both of them to cooperate
in order to get the food.

01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:24.140
And what he shows is, after
the cooperative relationship

01:13:24.140 --> 01:13:26.080
has been established
with them, if you

01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:29.540
change the workings of it
that it requires both of them

01:13:29.540 --> 01:13:32.170
to pull the food in
but the food winds

01:13:32.170 --> 01:13:34.740
up going to only
one of the chimps,

01:13:34.740 --> 01:13:37.010
that champ is more
likely to share

01:13:37.010 --> 01:13:39.260
the food with the
other individual

01:13:39.260 --> 01:13:42.600
than if they didn't have a
working-together relationship.

01:13:42.600 --> 01:13:46.030
That chimp, on some Frans
de Waal sort of level,

01:13:46.030 --> 01:13:49.900
was feeling bad for the other
guy getting a rotten deal.

01:13:49.900 --> 01:13:53.030
Under those circumstances, if
it was a chimp that you already

01:13:53.030 --> 01:13:55.800
had a cooperative
relationship with,

01:13:55.800 --> 01:13:57.730
you were more likely
to share with them

01:13:57.730 --> 01:14:01.940
after they had gotten something
aversive occur to them.

01:14:01.940 --> 01:14:03.260
What else?

01:14:03.260 --> 01:14:06.480
What else, in terms of making
sense of other species--

01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:08.260
what are unique, what are not?

01:14:08.260 --> 01:14:10.470
Dominance hierarchies.

01:14:10.470 --> 01:14:13.580
And if you come from a
certain school of sociology,

01:14:13.580 --> 01:14:17.160
humans are the least
hierarchical species out there.

01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:20.470
We are not territorial, in the
sense of lots of other species.

01:14:20.470 --> 01:14:22.500
We do not have
strict hierarchies.

01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:24.280
And what you see
in other species

01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:27.220
are hierarchies can mean
very different things.

01:14:27.220 --> 01:14:29.420
And the broad
dichotomy that's made

01:14:29.420 --> 01:14:33.740
is between top-down
hierarchies and bottom-up ones.

01:14:33.740 --> 01:14:38.090
Top-down, you have a single,
dominating, most aggressive

01:14:38.090 --> 01:14:40.220
individual who is
up there on top.

01:14:40.220 --> 01:14:42.280
And the characteristic
of this-- it's also

01:14:42.280 --> 01:14:45.390
called a "despotic"
hierarchy-- is

01:14:45.390 --> 01:14:49.620
extremely unequal
distribution of resources

01:14:49.620 --> 01:14:54.220
enforced by violence or
threats of violence from above.

01:14:54.220 --> 01:14:55.490
That's baboons.

01:14:55.490 --> 01:14:56.700
That's chimps.

01:14:56.700 --> 01:14:58.350
That's rhesus monkeys.

01:14:58.350 --> 01:15:00.680
Then you look at
vervet monkeys, and you

01:15:00.680 --> 01:15:04.200
see a bottom-up, what is
also termed "egalitarian,"

01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:05.200
hierarchy.

01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:09.020
There is a hierarchy, but the
number one individual there

01:15:09.020 --> 01:15:12.230
is only there with the
cooperation of everyone else.

01:15:12.230 --> 01:15:15.850
If that individual becomes
abusive, they are overthrown.

01:15:15.850 --> 01:15:18.300
So hierarchy does
not, in other species,

01:15:18.300 --> 01:15:22.700
automatically mean abusive,
aggressive, dominating,

01:15:22.700 --> 01:15:24.730
unequal-distribution stuff.

01:15:24.730 --> 01:15:28.020
What it is is, it
varies by species.

01:15:28.020 --> 01:15:29.890
What also becomes clear,
by the time you're

01:15:29.890 --> 01:15:32.410
looking at other
species, is it gets

01:15:32.410 --> 01:15:36.590
really hard to figure out what
does indeed count as violence.

01:15:36.590 --> 01:15:41.280
Example-- East African primate
called a "patas" monkey.

01:15:41.280 --> 01:15:44.650
Go and study patas
monkeys, and spend 40, 50,

01:15:44.650 --> 01:15:47.050
60 years doing it,
and what you will see

01:15:47.050 --> 01:15:50.760
are virtually no instances
of male patas monkeys

01:15:50.760 --> 01:15:53.320
having fights with each other.

01:15:53.320 --> 01:15:54.110
Wow!

01:15:54.110 --> 01:15:55.810
That's a pretty
unaggressive species.

01:15:55.810 --> 01:15:57.280
That's kind of nice.

01:15:57.280 --> 01:16:00.060
Put two male patas
monkeys in a cage,

01:16:00.060 --> 01:16:03.340
and not only will they start
fighting soon afterward,

01:16:03.340 --> 01:16:05.440
they will fight to the death.

01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:10.990
Because they have no signals
of terminating aggression.

01:16:10.990 --> 01:16:12.940
What's the deal with that?

01:16:12.940 --> 01:16:17.190
This is a species where the
level of male-male tension

01:16:17.190 --> 01:16:19.990
and male-male
aggression is so high

01:16:19.990 --> 01:16:22.870
that the entire social
structure of these species

01:16:22.870 --> 01:16:26.460
are built around keeping males
as far apart as possible.

01:16:26.460 --> 01:16:28.510
You don't see male
patas monkeys having

01:16:28.510 --> 01:16:30.690
fights, not because
they're not aggressive

01:16:30.690 --> 01:16:33.880
but because they live in
these dispersed patterns.

01:16:33.880 --> 01:16:36.590
So is this an aggressive
species, or not?

01:16:36.590 --> 01:16:39.360
This isn't an aggressive
species; you never see a fight.

01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:41.590
This is an insanely
aggressive species;

01:16:41.590 --> 01:16:43.660
the central feature of
their social structure

01:16:43.660 --> 01:16:46.760
is keeping violent males
away from each other.

01:16:46.760 --> 01:16:47.980
What does it count as?

01:16:47.980 --> 01:16:50.660
What does it count as
when you see an animal

01:16:50.660 --> 01:16:54.230
leap on top of another
animal and rip it to shreds?

01:16:54.230 --> 01:16:56.320
Sometimes that's
aggression, sometimes

01:16:56.320 --> 01:16:57.800
that's getting dinner.

01:16:57.800 --> 01:17:00.660
Once again, as with the
sexual-behavior realm--

01:17:00.660 --> 01:17:04.760
this whole realm, back
to the limbic anatomy of,

01:17:04.760 --> 01:17:06.320
are you looking at aggression?

01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:07.970
Are you looking at predation?

01:17:07.970 --> 01:17:10.830
These are totally different
biological phenomena.

01:17:10.830 --> 01:17:12.150
That takes some work.

01:17:12.150 --> 01:17:14.710
What has always been
one of the big questions

01:17:14.710 --> 01:17:17.040
in the field is,
so, what's the deal

01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:19.190
with rough-and-tumble play?

01:17:19.190 --> 01:17:20.440
What's play about?

01:17:20.440 --> 01:17:23.470
Because you see it in
endless species out there.

01:17:23.470 --> 01:17:26.320
A lot of studies show that
during periods of famine,

01:17:26.320 --> 01:17:28.760
for example, one of
the last behaviors that

01:17:28.760 --> 01:17:31.060
disappears from kids is play.

01:17:31.060 --> 01:17:34.270
It is really, really
hard-wired in there.

01:17:34.270 --> 01:17:38.210
So when you see aggressive
play, is this truly aggression,

01:17:38.210 --> 01:17:41.090
or is this practicing
the building blocks

01:17:41.090 --> 01:17:44.080
for the real stuff that
will come later on?

01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:45.760
What a lot of the
primate studies

01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:49.090
suggest is, it's not
practice, it's not play,

01:17:49.090 --> 01:17:52.510
it's already establishing
some of the asymmetries that

01:17:52.510 --> 01:17:55.160
will be there later in life.

01:17:55.160 --> 01:17:55.820
OK.

01:17:55.820 --> 01:17:58.670
So, all sorts of ways
in which aggression

01:17:58.670 --> 01:18:01.530
can pop up in other species,
in unexpected realms,

01:18:01.530 --> 01:18:03.840
in which cooperation,
all sorts of things

01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:07.510
like that-- what are some
of the unique human ones?

01:18:07.510 --> 01:18:09.800
Nonetheless, amid all
those similarities,

01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:13.490
we do things that are
completely unprecedented.

01:18:13.490 --> 01:18:15.780
We are perfectly
capable of being

01:18:15.780 --> 01:18:18.920
as violent as a chimp, when
it comes to cudgeling somebody

01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:19.850
over the head.

01:18:19.850 --> 01:18:22.100
But we're the only
species that could

01:18:22.100 --> 01:18:25.500
be violent by doing nothing
more physically taxing then

01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:30.330
pulling a trigger or looking
the other away or releasing

01:18:30.330 --> 01:18:33.080
a bomb from 30,000
feet up in the air

01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:38.560
or being passive-aggressive
or damning with faint praise.

01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:41.550
And we're suddenly doing
all sorts of much more

01:18:41.550 --> 01:18:43.490
subtle things with aggression.

01:18:43.490 --> 01:18:46.730
Here's three examples
of human aggression--

01:18:46.730 --> 01:18:48.970
and I've heard
about-- which shows

01:18:48.970 --> 01:18:52.720
just how complex of a
phenomenon this could be.

01:18:52.720 --> 01:18:54.230
First one.

01:18:54.230 --> 01:18:56.000
This was the child
of a friend of mine,

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:57.870
when she was about
five years old

01:18:57.870 --> 01:19:00.550
and she was in kindergarten
or pre-K or something.

01:19:00.550 --> 01:19:02.880
And there was another kid
there that she was not

01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:04.000
getting along with.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:07.540
And this was around Easter, and
they were painting Easter eggs.

01:19:07.540 --> 01:19:10.100
And some tussle came
up between them.

01:19:10.100 --> 01:19:13.720
And my friend's daughter broke
the other kid's Easter egg.

01:19:13.720 --> 01:19:17.450
Tears, hysteria, teachers
swooping in to say,

01:19:17.450 --> 01:19:20.240
you're not a bad child but
you've done a bad thing,

01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:21.740
and you can't do
stuff like that.

01:19:21.740 --> 01:19:25.780
And you are going to paint a
new Easter egg, to give to her,

01:19:25.780 --> 01:19:28.630
to make up for the
one that you broke.

01:19:28.630 --> 01:19:30.970
So my friend's kid proceeds
to go to the corner

01:19:30.970 --> 01:19:33.180
with this new egg and
some paintbrushes.

01:19:33.180 --> 01:19:35.737
And what becomes apparent
after a while is she's sort of,

01:19:35.737 --> 01:19:38.320
like, looking over her shoulder
and working away on something,

01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:40.380
here, and glowering
back at everybody.

01:19:40.380 --> 01:19:42.980
And finally she comes
up to the other kid

01:19:42.980 --> 01:19:46.180
and says, here's your stupid
Easter egg, Happy Easter,

01:19:46.180 --> 01:19:49.352
and gives her an egg that
she's painted completely black.

01:19:49.352 --> 01:19:51.140
[LAUGHTER]

01:19:51.140 --> 01:19:52.210
OK.

01:19:52.210 --> 01:19:54.390
What's with the
aggression, here?

01:19:54.390 --> 01:19:57.920
Easter eggs--
pastel colors, bunny

01:19:57.920 --> 01:20:00.130
rabbits-- all that
sort of thing.

01:20:00.130 --> 01:20:04.410
Easter eggs are not supposed
to be one solid color

01:20:04.410 --> 01:20:06.650
and certainly not jet black.

01:20:06.650 --> 01:20:09.190
That's not what-- what
was she doing, here?

01:20:09.190 --> 01:20:11.850
She was cooperating with
the letter of the law

01:20:11.850 --> 01:20:14.740
while doing as much violence
to the spirit of the law as

01:20:14.740 --> 01:20:15.530
possible.

01:20:15.530 --> 01:20:18.240
What she was saying
was, she is making

01:20:18.240 --> 01:20:21.210
me paint this egg for you, and
I don't like you one bit more

01:20:21.210 --> 01:20:22.500
than 30 minutes ago.

01:20:22.500 --> 01:20:24.490
And, showing that
the other kid fully

01:20:24.490 --> 01:20:27.160
understood what this human
bit of passive-aggression

01:20:27.160 --> 01:20:32.130
was about, she burst into tears
as soon as she saw the egg.

01:20:32.130 --> 01:20:35.360
Next example of the subtlety
of human aggression.

01:20:35.360 --> 01:20:38.774
And this one involved my wife.

01:20:38.774 --> 01:20:39.273
OK.

01:20:39.273 --> 01:20:40.200
[LAUGHTER]

01:20:40.200 --> 01:20:42.090
So this was-- occasion.

01:20:42.090 --> 01:20:45.147
We were, like, driving
around somewhere-- minivan,

01:20:45.147 --> 01:20:45.730
with our kids.

01:20:45.730 --> 01:20:49.410
And some total jerk,
like, cut us off.

01:20:49.410 --> 01:20:52.800
And-- you know, he could
have killed us and our kids,

01:20:52.800 --> 01:20:54.700
and-- [GROWL OF FRUSTRATION].

01:20:54.700 --> 01:20:55.780
My wife was driving.

01:20:55.780 --> 01:20:58.050
And we sort of get past
what should logically

01:20:58.050 --> 01:21:00.590
have been about five seconds
of cursing the person.

01:21:00.590 --> 01:21:04.362
And she suddenly says,
I'm going after this guy.

01:21:04.362 --> 01:21:05.760
[LAUGHTER]

01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:08.970
And she proceeds
to trail the guy

01:21:08.970 --> 01:21:10.699
and trails him for
about two miles,

01:21:10.699 --> 01:21:12.990
while I'm sitting there
getting increasingly distressed

01:21:12.990 --> 01:21:14.430
and panicked.

01:21:14.430 --> 01:21:17.019
And eventually
he, like, realizes

01:21:17.019 --> 01:21:18.560
he's being followed
now and is taking

01:21:18.560 --> 01:21:20.050
sort of evasive maneuvers.

01:21:20.050 --> 01:21:23.130
And eventually we get
him on this street

01:21:23.130 --> 01:21:24.910
where there's a red
light, there, where

01:21:24.910 --> 01:21:26.857
there's a car in front of him.

01:21:26.857 --> 01:21:27.940
And then we're behind him.

01:21:27.940 --> 01:21:29.680
So it's not like he
could, in a panic,

01:21:29.680 --> 01:21:32.570
go through the red light, there,
because he's trapped there.

01:21:32.570 --> 01:21:34.779
And we happen to know this
was a very long red light.

01:21:34.779 --> 01:21:37.153
While I've been sitting there,
for the last five minutes,

01:21:37.153 --> 01:21:38.800
saying, um, do you
think this is really

01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:41.620
a good-- [VROOM] go
around another corner,

01:21:41.620 --> 01:21:42.650
tracking him down.

01:21:42.650 --> 01:21:43.680
So we're sitting there.

01:21:43.680 --> 01:21:46.710
And suddenly my wife says,
I'm going over there.

01:21:46.710 --> 01:21:49.290
And she grabs something from
between the seats and storms

01:21:49.290 --> 01:21:49.400
out.

01:21:49.400 --> 01:21:51.600
While I say, um, do you
really think that's a good--

01:21:51.600 --> 01:21:52.220
[LAUGHTER]

01:21:52.220 --> 01:21:52.720
She's gone.

01:21:52.720 --> 01:21:55.010
So I, like, get out,
and I run over there.

01:21:55.010 --> 01:21:57.090
And I see the window's
down in the car.

01:21:57.090 --> 01:21:59.110
And she's yelling at the guy.

01:21:59.110 --> 01:22:01.800
And she says, anybody
who could do something

01:22:01.800 --> 01:22:02.780
like that needs this.

01:22:02.780 --> 01:22:05.380
And she flings something at him.

01:22:05.380 --> 01:22:07.710
So she comes back to
the car, at that point.

01:22:07.710 --> 01:22:08.860
And the light has changed.

01:22:08.860 --> 01:22:12.680
And this guy, like,
slinks off into the--

01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:16.290
if it is possible for a car to
look sheepish, moving, like,

01:22:16.290 --> 01:22:19.010
four miles an hour, heads
off into the sunset,

01:22:19.010 --> 01:22:21.380
down this dark,
little block, there.

01:22:21.380 --> 01:22:22.660
So, sitting there.

01:22:22.660 --> 01:22:26.220
And she's milking this
for all it's worth.

01:22:26.220 --> 01:22:27.970
And turn-- what did
you put in there?

01:22:27.970 --> 01:22:31.370
And she looks totally
delighted with herself.

01:22:31.370 --> 01:22:33.620
And she's, like, euphoric.

01:22:33.620 --> 01:22:35.880
And I said, well, what
did you say to him?

01:22:35.880 --> 01:22:37.900
You-- what was
that-- and she said,

01:22:37.900 --> 01:22:40.745
anyone that could do anything
this mean needs one of these.

01:22:40.745 --> 01:22:42.120
And I said, what
did you do then?

01:22:42.120 --> 01:22:44.986
And she said, I threw
a lollipop at him.

01:22:44.986 --> 01:22:45.486
[LAUGHTER]

01:22:45.486 --> 01:22:47.210
I said, whoa!

01:22:47.210 --> 01:22:48.625
You killer, you!

01:22:48.625 --> 01:22:51.130
You-- I was so proud of her.

01:22:51.130 --> 01:22:54.570
My god, the violence
intrinsic in that!

01:22:54.570 --> 01:22:58.080
No other species would know
what was that going on, there,

01:22:58.080 --> 01:23:01.780
in terms of the intrinsic
passive-aggression

01:23:01.780 --> 01:23:04.459
and all of that.

01:23:04.459 --> 01:23:06.000
We're the only ones
who could come up

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.020
with something like that.

01:23:08.020 --> 01:23:10.550
Third example.

01:23:10.550 --> 01:23:14.220
Every day, out in
Nevada, in a town there,

01:23:14.220 --> 01:23:17.910
there are men who get
up to go off to work,

01:23:17.910 --> 01:23:20.850
and they kiss the
family goodbye.

01:23:20.850 --> 01:23:24.140
And they've got to get reminded
to pick up the dry cleaning.

01:23:24.140 --> 01:23:26.527
And they get in the car, and
they're a little bit late,

01:23:26.527 --> 01:23:28.110
and there's a lot
of traffic, and they

01:23:28.110 --> 01:23:30.250
get all stressed
about the traffic jam.

01:23:30.250 --> 01:23:32.300
But they get there
to work on time.

01:23:32.300 --> 01:23:34.290
And they're a little
bit relaxed there.

01:23:34.290 --> 01:23:35.950
And they finally can come in.

01:23:35.950 --> 01:23:38.440
And they sit down
in a chair in what

01:23:38.440 --> 01:23:42.350
is a model of the cockpit
of a fighter plane.

01:23:42.350 --> 01:23:45.570
And what they do is
control drone airplanes

01:23:45.570 --> 01:23:48.120
on the other side of
the planet, in Iraq.

01:23:48.120 --> 01:23:49.815
And they spend the
day, sitting there

01:23:49.815 --> 01:23:52.460
at their work shift,
controlling planes that

01:23:52.460 --> 01:23:56.330
release bombs and missiles
and destroy people

01:23:56.330 --> 01:23:58.450
12,000 miles away.

01:23:58.450 --> 01:24:00.240
So they spend the
entire day, sitting

01:24:00.240 --> 01:24:05.880
there in this air-conditioned
room in Nevis Air Force Base,

01:24:05.880 --> 01:24:07.540
just outside Las Vegas.

01:24:07.540 --> 01:24:09.500
And they spend the
day doing that.

01:24:09.500 --> 01:24:11.980
And at the end of the
day, they pick up,

01:24:11.980 --> 01:24:14.030
and they tell everyone
they'll see them tomorrow.

01:24:14.030 --> 01:24:16.840
And they go pick up
the dry cleaning.

01:24:16.840 --> 01:24:20.140
And they go to their little
daughter's ballet concert.

01:24:20.140 --> 01:24:23.170
And afterward they
hug her and can't

01:24:23.170 --> 01:24:25.310
believe they could love
somebody this much.

01:24:25.310 --> 01:24:27.060
And then the next
morning they go

01:24:27.060 --> 01:24:29.080
back to spending their
day killing people

01:24:29.080 --> 01:24:31.390
on the other side of the planet.

01:24:31.390 --> 01:24:33.630
There is not a whole
lot of species out there

01:24:33.630 --> 01:24:35.620
who could do that, either.

01:24:35.620 --> 01:24:37.470
So by the time
you're getting to us,

01:24:37.470 --> 01:24:42.120
we have ways of being awful to
other members of our species

01:24:42.120 --> 01:24:43.972
that are simply unmatched.

01:24:43.972 --> 01:24:47.020
And we have ways of
being empathic, as well.

01:24:47.020 --> 01:24:50.450
As we begin to wrestle,
here, with the neurobiology

01:24:50.450 --> 01:24:52.980
and endocrinology and
finally walking our way back

01:24:52.980 --> 01:24:56.630
towards the left, we're going
to have this huge problem

01:24:56.630 --> 01:25:01.310
of the context of aggression and
this even huger problem of just

01:25:01.310 --> 01:25:04.700
how complex aggression
and empathy are,

01:25:04.700 --> 01:25:06.950
when you leave it to humans.

01:25:06.950 --> 01:25:09.540
Examples at the empathy end.

01:25:09.540 --> 01:25:11.140
Human versions of it.

01:25:11.140 --> 01:25:13.630
The things we are
able to reconcile.

01:25:13.630 --> 01:25:15.830
We are a species
who has invented

01:25:15.830 --> 01:25:20.410
truth-and-reconciliation
commissions in South Africa,

01:25:20.410 --> 01:25:24.870
in the Balkans, in Rwanda,
where people face the person who

01:25:24.870 --> 01:25:29.160
did that to them, the person who
destroyed their life, destroyed

01:25:29.160 --> 01:25:30.150
their family.

01:25:30.150 --> 01:25:33.390
And going through what is by
now a fairly well-worked-out

01:25:33.390 --> 01:25:36.530
process that all sorts
of people have studied.

01:25:36.530 --> 01:25:40.720
And, in some of those cases,
there is reconciliation.

01:25:40.720 --> 01:25:43.010
There is even forgiveness.

01:25:43.010 --> 01:25:45.700
How can this possibly happen?

01:25:45.700 --> 01:25:49.240
We have a world where we
try to have individuals

01:25:49.240 --> 01:25:54.230
foster peace through the
most unlikely of rationales.

01:25:54.230 --> 01:26:00.100
I will let no man spoil my
soul by causing me to hate him.

01:26:00.100 --> 01:26:03.510
That is a psychology
that is unprecedented.

01:26:03.510 --> 01:26:09.040
We have the world of people like
this Catholic nun, Sister Helen

01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:11.780
Prejean, who has spent
her entire career

01:26:11.780 --> 01:26:14.570
ministering to the needs
of men on death row

01:26:14.570 --> 01:26:17.370
in a maximum-security
prison in Louisiana.

01:26:17.370 --> 01:26:19.580
She was the person who
was featured in the movie

01:26:19.580 --> 01:26:21.640
way back when, Dead Man Walking.

01:26:21.640 --> 01:26:24.390
And what she spent a
lot of her time doing

01:26:24.390 --> 01:26:27.180
is having incredulous
people, often

01:26:27.180 --> 01:26:29.600
the relatives of the
victims of these murderers,

01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:32.630
come up and say,
how can you do this?

01:26:32.630 --> 01:26:36.550
How could you spend your life
devoted to people like these?

01:26:36.550 --> 01:26:38.560
And she comes up
with an answer that

01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:43.130
is so definedly human, that no
other species could come near.

01:26:43.130 --> 01:26:45.720
No matter how much
they groom victims,

01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:49.760
her answer always is, the
less forgivable the act,

01:26:49.760 --> 01:26:51.730
the more it must be forgiven.

01:26:51.730 --> 01:26:56.310
The less lovable the person,
the more they must be loved.

01:26:56.310 --> 01:27:00.140
And suddenly we're in a world
that the more something cannot

01:27:00.140 --> 01:27:04.900
be, the more it must be, as
a moral sort of act to do.

01:27:04.900 --> 01:27:07.750
Whoa-- nobody out there
in the animal kingdom

01:27:07.750 --> 01:27:10.090
is going to have a
clue what we're up to.

01:27:10.090 --> 01:27:12.930
This is very complex
terrain we are

01:27:12.930 --> 01:27:15.510
going to deal with, here,
as we now shift over

01:27:15.510 --> 01:27:17.741
to the biology of it.

01:27:17.741 --> 01:27:18.240
OK.

01:27:18.240 --> 01:27:20.330
So, starting now
with our strategy--

01:27:20.330 --> 01:27:22.000
a violent act occurs.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:23.870
An empathic act occurs.

01:27:23.870 --> 01:27:25.490
Any in these categories.

01:27:25.490 --> 01:27:29.045
What was going on in the
brain, one second before?

01:27:29.045 --> 01:27:30.420
And, of course,
what do you know?

01:27:30.420 --> 01:27:32.700
We're going to immediately
going to land is,

01:27:32.700 --> 01:27:34.940
right in the middle
of the limbic system.

01:27:34.940 --> 01:27:39.530
And, just as the Kluver-Bucy
syndrome from the 1980s,

01:27:39.530 --> 01:27:42.520
as we heard about last
week-- just as that syndrome,

01:27:42.520 --> 01:27:44.480
when you destroy
the limbic system,

01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:48.390
you get completely inappropriate
sexual behavior in primates.

01:27:48.390 --> 01:27:50.260
What those studies
also showed was,

01:27:50.260 --> 01:27:53.640
you get completely inappropriate
aggressive behavior.

01:27:53.640 --> 01:27:54.520
OK.

01:27:54.520 --> 01:27:57.090
So, with 80-year-old
research, we've

01:27:57.090 --> 01:27:59.060
now landed in the limbic system.

01:27:59.060 --> 01:28:02.230
What are the subregions
that are relevant?

01:28:02.230 --> 01:28:05.030
The area that comes in
at the top of the list,

01:28:05.030 --> 01:28:08.400
immediately, that we've already
heard a fair amount about,

01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:10.210
is the amygdala.

01:28:10.210 --> 01:28:13.260
The amygdala and
its role in fear,

01:28:13.260 --> 01:28:16.410
its role in anxiety--
that strange role,

01:28:16.410 --> 01:28:18.590
in males, of sexual motivation.

01:28:18.590 --> 01:28:20.730
But what the amygdala
is most renowned for

01:28:20.730 --> 01:28:22.770
is its role in aggression.

01:28:22.770 --> 01:28:24.830
And, as I emphasized
last week, it

01:28:24.830 --> 01:28:27.700
is mighty interesting,
I think, that the part

01:28:27.700 --> 01:28:30.700
of the brain which is most
responsive to when you are

01:28:30.700 --> 01:28:32.730
scared is the part
of the brain that

01:28:32.730 --> 01:28:35.390
generates the starts
of aggressive behavior.

01:28:35.390 --> 01:28:39.710
Again, in a world in which
no neuron need be afraid,

01:28:39.710 --> 01:28:43.480
we're going to have a lot fewer
aggressive amygdalas out there.

01:28:43.480 --> 01:28:44.530
What's the evidence?

01:28:44.530 --> 01:28:46.460
You know the drill by now.

01:28:46.460 --> 01:28:49.700
You go and you destroy
the amygdala in an animal,

01:28:49.700 --> 01:28:54.400
and you are incapable of
eliciting aggression from them.

01:28:54.400 --> 01:28:57.300
You go and you do the
same thing in a human,

01:28:57.300 --> 01:28:59.630
and you get the
exact same result.

01:28:59.630 --> 01:29:02.200
One of those dark,
horrible chapters

01:29:02.200 --> 01:29:04.810
in the history of
science-- another realm

01:29:04.810 --> 01:29:08.270
of legally enforced
psychosurgery.

01:29:08.270 --> 01:29:11.410
This was a trend that
was very, very popular

01:29:11.410 --> 01:29:15.300
in the '60s and '70s--
court-ordered amygdalectomies

01:29:15.300 --> 01:29:16.510
of people.

01:29:16.510 --> 01:29:18.450
And this was a
technique where people

01:29:18.450 --> 01:29:22.620
would go in with a lesioning
syringe into each side--

01:29:22.620 --> 01:29:25.610
the amygdala is a bilateral
structure-- there's

01:29:25.610 --> 01:29:27.600
two of them, way
deep in the brain--

01:29:27.600 --> 01:29:30.540
and go in and destroy
the structure.

01:29:30.540 --> 01:29:34.020
And this would
decrease aggression.

01:29:34.020 --> 01:29:36.800
This would decrease
all sorts of stuff.

01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:40.170
This wound up on the front
page of the New York Times

01:29:40.170 --> 01:29:44.910
when, around 1970, three
neurosurgeons at Harvard

01:29:44.910 --> 01:29:48.450
wrote a letter to the New
York Times, pointing out

01:29:48.450 --> 01:29:50.810
there's this great
surgical technique

01:29:50.810 --> 01:29:52.810
which they were the
pioneers of where

01:29:52.810 --> 01:29:54.960
you could take aggressive
humans and make

01:29:54.960 --> 01:29:58.100
them less aggressive with
no other side effects.

01:29:58.100 --> 01:29:59.750
You could make them
less aggressive.

01:29:59.750 --> 01:30:03.250
And haven't you been noticing
that our inner cities have been

01:30:03.250 --> 01:30:05.390
burning and rife with violence?

01:30:05.390 --> 01:30:07.930
Maybe it's time to start
thinking about doing

01:30:07.930 --> 01:30:10.130
some of these preemptively.

01:30:10.130 --> 01:30:12.910
This was a letter
from these three guys

01:30:12.910 --> 01:30:14.680
from Harvard Med School.

01:30:14.680 --> 01:30:16.580
No surprise, not
everybody sort of

01:30:16.580 --> 01:30:19.390
thought this was the swellest
idea that they had ever heard.

01:30:19.390 --> 01:30:24.120
This generated this huge fight
over the psychosurgical use

01:30:24.120 --> 01:30:27.230
of court-enforced
amygdalectomies.

01:30:27.230 --> 01:30:30.630
And before it was over with,
it had just as bad of a history

01:30:30.630 --> 01:30:32.450
as frontal lobotomies.

01:30:32.450 --> 01:30:35.150
People subjected
to amygdalectomies

01:30:35.150 --> 01:30:40.200
because they were argumentative,
because they, as teenagers,

01:30:40.200 --> 01:30:41.780
didn't listen to their parents.

01:30:41.780 --> 01:30:43.650
They didn't listen
to their teachers.

01:30:43.650 --> 01:30:45.900
Thousands of cases of these.

01:30:45.900 --> 01:30:48.780
The one thing that was
clear was that, yes, indeed,

01:30:48.780 --> 01:30:52.070
aggressive behavior would
decrease in these individuals.

01:30:52.070 --> 01:30:55.070
There would not be a whole lot
of a person left afterward.

01:30:55.070 --> 01:30:57.390
So, lesioning evidence.

01:30:57.390 --> 01:30:58.930
Stimulation evidence.

01:30:58.930 --> 01:31:00.940
You know the flip
side of that by now.

01:31:00.940 --> 01:31:03.800
Now stick an electrode
into the rat's amygdala

01:31:03.800 --> 01:31:06.650
and stimulate, electrically
stimulate, there.

01:31:06.650 --> 01:31:11.040
And you produce wildly
aggressive behavior.

01:31:11.040 --> 01:31:14.470
And you see two equivalents
of that in humans.

01:31:14.470 --> 01:31:18.540
And in both of these
cases, stupendously rare.

01:31:18.540 --> 01:31:22.310
First is a very,
very, very rare type

01:31:22.310 --> 01:31:25.170
of epilepsy, where
what you get is

01:31:25.170 --> 01:31:28.850
the epileptic focus, the place
where the seizure begins,

01:31:28.850 --> 01:31:30.380
is in the amygdala.

01:31:30.380 --> 01:31:33.720
What you see is, with
most types of epilepsy,

01:31:33.720 --> 01:31:36.960
the place where it starts
in the brain, a seizure,

01:31:36.960 --> 01:31:39.980
tells you a whole lot about
matching with the behavior.

01:31:39.980 --> 01:31:42.620
People, just before the
onset of the seizure,

01:31:42.620 --> 01:31:45.320
will get olfactory
auras-- two or three

01:31:45.320 --> 01:31:48.400
seconds of
hallucinating an odor.

01:31:48.400 --> 01:31:51.260
That's a seizure that's
starting somewhere down

01:31:51.260 --> 01:31:54.040
in the olfactory part
of the limbic system.

01:31:54.040 --> 01:31:55.860
You see all sorts of cases.

01:31:55.860 --> 01:31:58.650
There have been documented
cases of epileptics

01:31:58.650 --> 01:32:02.110
who see a mathematical
equation for two seconds

01:32:02.110 --> 01:32:03.780
before the seizure hits.

01:32:03.780 --> 01:32:06.560
And that's an area of the
cortex where it turns up.

01:32:06.560 --> 01:32:10.210
Auditory seizures, where they
hear two measures of music--

01:32:10.210 --> 01:32:12.390
the same two measures
before it hits.

01:32:12.390 --> 01:32:15.870
What you see when you've got
these rare epilepsies, where

01:32:15.870 --> 01:32:18.320
the seizure begins
in the amygdala, is,

01:32:18.320 --> 01:32:22.316
two seconds before, the
person becomes furious.

01:32:22.316 --> 01:32:29.020
They-- I can't bel-- I am so
ang-- and then it happens.

01:32:29.020 --> 01:32:32.520
So, uncontrolled stimulation
in the amygdala, and you

01:32:32.520 --> 01:32:34.240
get some aggression there.

01:32:34.240 --> 01:32:36.610
The next thing that
you see is evidence

01:32:36.610 --> 01:32:38.661
of the amygdaloid stimulation.

01:32:38.661 --> 01:32:39.160
OK.

01:32:39.160 --> 01:32:41.882
Anybody ever hear of a
guy named Charles Whitman?

01:32:44.770 --> 01:32:48.510
Hands-- oh, what are they
teaching you guys, here?

01:32:48.510 --> 01:32:49.010
OK.

01:32:49.010 --> 01:32:53.290
Charles Whitman was once
America's record-holding mass

01:32:53.290 --> 01:32:54.310
murderer.

01:32:54.310 --> 01:32:57.840
And he was the best
that we could come up

01:32:57.840 --> 01:32:59.510
with in the early 1960s.

01:32:59.510 --> 01:33:01.480
And, oh, his records
have been eclipsed

01:33:01.480 --> 01:33:03.290
by so many people since then.

01:33:03.290 --> 01:33:06.830
But he was once our
gold-medal mass murderer.

01:33:06.830 --> 01:33:10.280
This was the guy who,
in 1962, I think,

01:33:10.280 --> 01:33:14.440
climbed up the famed clock tower
at the University of Texas,

01:33:14.440 --> 01:33:18.400
Austin, campus and opened
fire on people below.

01:33:18.400 --> 01:33:20.980
And then killed
himself, afterward.

01:33:20.980 --> 01:33:24.000
This was the first of the
rounding up the neighbors

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:27.050
to say, oh my god, he
was such a quiet guy-- he

01:33:27.050 --> 01:33:28.460
was such a nice neighbor.

01:33:28.460 --> 01:33:33.030
This was the first of the
literal choirboys-- my god,

01:33:33.030 --> 01:33:35.520
where did this come from--
no hint of anything.

01:33:35.520 --> 01:33:41.250
On postmortem, he was found to
have a tumor in his amygdala.

01:33:41.250 --> 01:33:42.910
Another rare case of that.

01:33:42.910 --> 01:33:47.200
During the 1970s, there was an
extreme leftist terrorist group

01:33:47.200 --> 01:33:50.340
in Germany called the
Baader-Meinhof gang.

01:33:50.340 --> 01:33:52.610
And these were the two
people who began it.

01:33:52.610 --> 01:33:58.220
And one of the two stupendously
violent people-- one of the two

01:33:58.220 --> 01:34:02.890
found, on postmortem, to
have a tumor in her amygdala.

01:34:02.890 --> 01:34:06.140
So these very, very
rare cases of this,

01:34:06.140 --> 01:34:08.460
fitting with this
theme-- circumstances

01:34:08.460 --> 01:34:11.690
that increase the
metabolism in the amygdala.

01:34:11.690 --> 01:34:14.220
Out comes aggressive behavior.

01:34:14.220 --> 01:34:15.380
More evidence.

01:34:15.380 --> 01:34:18.190
Now, another strategy
from the limbic lectures.

01:34:18.190 --> 01:34:19.420
Put in the electrode.

01:34:19.420 --> 01:34:22.530
This is one that responds
to electrical signaling.

01:34:22.530 --> 01:34:24.500
Show somebody
something that evokes

01:34:24.500 --> 01:34:27.920
aggression, and their
amygdala has gotten activated.

01:34:27.920 --> 01:34:29.650
Do the same thing,
now, with a human.

01:34:29.650 --> 01:34:32.330
Put them in a brain
scanner, and show them

01:34:32.330 --> 01:34:34.170
something that evokes anger.

01:34:34.170 --> 01:34:38.580
And the metabolic rate in
their amygdala activates.

01:34:38.580 --> 01:34:41.480
So you see all sorts
of circumstances

01:34:41.480 --> 01:34:47.080
where you can document the
amygdala as playing this role.

01:34:47.080 --> 01:34:49.480
Interestingly, the amygdala
gets bigger, as we've heard,

01:34:49.480 --> 01:34:52.610
in people with posttraumatic
stress disorder.

01:34:52.610 --> 01:34:56.090
And what you see there
is also increased

01:34:56.090 --> 01:34:59.600
frequency of violent behavior.

01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:02.500
More evidence that the amygdala
plays a role-- and this

01:35:02.500 --> 01:35:04.550
was a very subtle finding.

01:35:04.550 --> 01:35:08.890
This was from-- oh my god,
the clock in the back!

01:35:08.890 --> 01:35:11.210
Turn around and
look at that clock.

01:35:11.210 --> 01:35:15.010
[LAUGHTER]

01:35:17.860 --> 01:35:19.130
Everybody run!

01:35:19.130 --> 01:35:20.390
[LAUGHTER]

01:35:20.390 --> 01:35:22.040
OK, well, now that
it's almost done,

01:35:22.040 --> 01:35:24.010
I'll mention the very
last thing, here.

01:35:24.010 --> 01:35:26.940
These were studies
done showing-- OK,

01:35:26.940 --> 01:35:29.240
people with amygdaloid
lesions, they

01:35:29.240 --> 01:35:34.780
are very bad at detecting faces
expressing angry emotions.

01:35:34.780 --> 01:35:39.270
They are more trusting of people
than average individuals are.

01:35:39.270 --> 01:35:41.710
They are more likely to forgive.

01:35:41.710 --> 01:35:45.060
They are less capable of picking
up on any of that information.

01:35:45.060 --> 01:35:48.640
And a wonderful study done by
this guy, Antonio Damasio--

01:35:48.640 --> 01:35:50.600
again, one of the lead
figures in the field.

01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:55.190
What he did was eye tracking on
people with amygdaloid lesions.

01:35:55.190 --> 01:35:58.380
You get someone with this
part of the brain destroyed,

01:35:58.380 --> 01:36:01.060
and they don't look at
the eyes of other people.

01:36:01.060 --> 01:36:04.320
When they examine faces,
they're looking at the nose.

01:36:04.320 --> 01:36:05.910
They're looking at the chin.

01:36:05.910 --> 01:36:10.130
They're not directing their gaze
to be able to pick up accurate

01:36:10.130 --> 01:36:12.680
information about emotions.

01:36:12.680 --> 01:36:14.100
So what do we see, here?

01:36:14.100 --> 01:36:17.780
The amygdala not only
responds to aggression

01:36:17.780 --> 01:36:19.700
and fear-provoking stimuli.

01:36:19.700 --> 01:36:23.320
The amygdala is able to
direct you to look for it.

01:36:23.320 --> 01:36:26.000
And what we will
see on Wednesday is,

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:29.040
one of the things
testosterone does in males

01:36:29.040 --> 01:36:30.730
is it makes them look harder.

01:36:30.730 --> 01:36:33.260
It lowers their
threshold for deciding

01:36:33.260 --> 01:36:37.240
that ambiguous
information is, in fact--

01:36:37.240 --> 01:36:40.510
