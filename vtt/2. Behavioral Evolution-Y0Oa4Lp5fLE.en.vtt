00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:08.150
Stanford University.

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:11.820
The often asked question, what's
the difference between Bio 150,

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.010
Bio 250, and-- is
it Hum Bio 160?

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:17.050
No difference.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:18.330
It's exactly the same.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.060
So like the same
requirements, same unit.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.130
So take whichever one
makes your life easiest.

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.630
Let's see.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.200
Any other procedural stuff?

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.560
Well, the answers are back
from Monday's questionnaire.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.530
And a variety of
interesting answers.

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.820
Not surprisingly, given
the size of a group.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.630
Why have you taken this course?

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.390
Really want to know about animal
behavior, but willing to deal

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:45.170
with humans.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:46.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.510
Because I'm substituting it Bio
43, which I don't want to take.

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.210
My dad used to make me read
books about human behavior

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.864
and biology as punishment.

00:00:55.864 --> 00:00:56.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.160
That doesn't make any sense.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.870
I know one of the
TAs, so I figure

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:05.920
that guarantees me an A. OK,
guys, that's in your court.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.490
One I really liked,
because I want

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.530
to be a filmmaker after college.

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.980
Yay, interdisciplinary.

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.200
What else?

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.600
My first grade
teacher is making me.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.270
Tom McFadden told me to.

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.320
I'm a hyper-oxygenated
dilettante.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.920
I wanted to, somewhat
correctly pointing out,

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.450
why have you taken this class?

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.110
I haven't taken it yet.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:31.560
A number of people
reporting that,

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.280
in fact, that was
the correct answer.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.500
And my favorite, why have
you taken this course?

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.206
Yes.

00:01:37.206 --> 00:01:39.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:41.700
OK.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.340
Relevant background,
relevant background.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.180
I'm human, I'm human
and I often behave.

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.130
I'm human and I have biology.

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.390
19 years of being confused
about human behavior.

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.400
Not really, sort of.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.410
Seeing crazy behavior as
an RA in an all frosh dorm.

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.731
And I date a biologist.

00:02:03.731 --> 00:02:04.230
Let's see.

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.100
There was also the
question on there of,

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.900
did the thing on the board
look more like an A or a B.

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.759
And just to really
facilitate that one,

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.590
I forgot to put
the A and the B up.

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.740
But that taps into a
cognitive something or other,

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.730
which maybe I'll get
back to at some point.

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:19.860
Telephone numbers.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.600
Reading them off,
accuracy dramatically

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.220
tanked as soon as
the three number,

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.730
four number motif
went down the tubes.

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.610
And when it came back
briefly, accuracy

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.240
came back a little bit.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.480
Finally, let's see.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.470
All of you guys conform to
a standard frequent gender

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:38.350
difference.

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.870
Which is everybody was roughly
equally-- by gender-- roughly

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.670
equally likely to see dependent
as the opposite of independent.

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.390
A small minority went
for interdependent.

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.360
However, one finding that
has come up over and over

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.340
is that far more females are
interested in peace than males,

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.160
males are more
interested in justice.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.530
OK, have you taken the bio core.

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.270
Quote, no way Jose.

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.750
Somebody pointing
out quite correctly,

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.160
don't settle for
peace or justice.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.660
Then of course,
there was the person

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.240
who responded to that question
by writing those words are just

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.850
symbols.

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.760
Need to know assumed meaning.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.676
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:18.676 --> 00:03:19.175
OK.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.270
There was one questionnaire
that was carefully

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.900
signed in something
approaching calligraphy,

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:28.840
it was so beautiful.

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.030
And was otherwise blank.

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.770
For years running, the subject
that most people really

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:39.350
want to hear, and most people
really don't want to hear,

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.050
is about the biology
of religiosity.

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:45.420
And for 22 years running
now, Stanford students

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.661
are more interested in
depression than sex.

00:03:47.661 --> 00:03:48.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.450
OK.

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:50.960
So we start off.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:55.620
I keep telling Hennessy about
this, but nothing gets done.

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.050
We start off.

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:04.900
We start off, if
I can open this--

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.100
which is something
you can do if you have

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.500
a certain type of training.

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.630
If you're some osteologist,
or whatever these folks are

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:13.270
called.

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:15.630
If you are presented
those two skulls

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.290
and told this one's
a female, this one's

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.470
a male, you can begin to figure
out stuff like how heavy,

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.590
how large the body was
of that individual, what

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.130
diseases they had, had they
undergone malnutrition,

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.670
had they given birth, a
lot of times, a few times,

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:34.110
were they bipedal.

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.180
All sorts of stuff
you could figure out

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.950
from just looking
at these skulls.

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:41.650
What today's lecture,
and Friday's, is about

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.760
is the fact that with the
right tools under your belt,

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.890
you could look at
these two skulls

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:48.610
and know that information.

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.030
You are a field biologist, and
you've discovered this brand

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:52.960
new species.

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.726
And you see that this
one nurses an infant

00:04:55.726 --> 00:04:57.350
shortly before leaping
out of the tree,

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:58.710
leaving only the skull.

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.930
And this one has
a penis, shortly

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.980
before leaping out of the
tree and leaving a skull.

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:07.720
So all you know is this is an
adult female and an adult male.

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.860
And if you've got the
right tools there,

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.890
you can figure out who's more
likely to cheat on the other.

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:17.430
Is the female more likely to
mess around, or is the male?

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.590
How high are the
levels of aggression?

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:23.540
Does the female tend to have
twins, or one kid at a time?

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:26.590
Do females choose males because
they have good parenting

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:29.820
skills, or because
they're big, hunky guys?

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.210
What levels of differences
in life expectancy?

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.190
Do they live the
same length of time?

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:38.000
You would be able to tell
whether they have the same life

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.330
expectancy or if there's a big
discrepancy between the two.

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.660
All sorts of stuff
like that, merely

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:46.880
by applying a certain
piece of logic

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.860
that dominates all of this.

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:52.380
OK, so you're back reading
those Time Life nature

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:55.050
books back when, and there
was always a style of thing

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:55.990
you would go through.

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:58.280
Which is they'd
describe some species

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.134
doing something absolutely
amazing and unlikely,

00:06:01.134 --> 00:06:02.050
and it goes like this.

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:04.970
The giraffe, the
giraffe has a long neck,

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:08.490
and it obviously has
to have a big heart

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:10.220
to pump all that blood up there.

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:13.270
And you lock up a whole
bunch of biomechanics people

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:17.250
with slide rules, and out they
come out with this prediction

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:19.930
as to how big the
giraffe heart should be

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:21.320
and how thick the walls.

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.620
And you go and you
measure a giraffe heart,

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:26.680
and it's exactly what
the equations predicted.

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.970
And you say, isn't
nature amazing?

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:33.220
Or you read about some desert
rodents that drink once

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:35.820
every three months, and
another bunch of folks

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:39.150
have done math and figured
out how many miles long

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:41.310
the renal tubules have to be.

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:42.930
And somebody goes
and studies it,

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:45.270
and it's exactly
as you expect it.

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:46.620
Isn't nature wonderful?

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:48.300
No, nature isn't wonderful.

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.560
You couldn't have
giraffes unless they

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:52.110
had hearts that were that big.

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:54.180
You couldn't have rodents
living in the desert

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:56.890
unless they had kidneys that
worked in a certain way.

00:06:56.890 --> 00:07:02.260
There is an inevitable logic
about how organisms function,

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.720
how organisms are
built, how organisms

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:08.260
have evolved solving this
problem of optimizing

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:09.150
the solution.

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:11.640
And what the next two
lectures are about is,

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:14.090
you can take the
same exact principles

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:18.150
and apply them to thinking
about the evolution of behavior.

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:20.490
The same sort of
logic where, just

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:23.110
as you could sit there and,
with logical principles,

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:26.100
come to the point of
saying, a giraffe's heart

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:27.490
is going to be this big.

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:30.060
You can go through a
different realm of logic built

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:33.560
around evolutionary principles
and figure out all sorts

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:36.740
of aspects of social behavior.

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:40.620
And we already know what's
involved in, say, optimizing.

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:43.290
What's the optimal number
of whatevers in your kidney.

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:46.520
What's the optimal behavior
strategy or something.

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:49.800
All of us, as soon as
we got some kid sibling,

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:54.020
learned how to do the optimal
strategy in tic-tac-toe.

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:56.780
So that you could never lose,
and it's totally boring.

00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:00.320
But that's a case of figuring
out the optimal solution

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:04.130
to behavior, reaching what is
called the Nash equilibrium.

00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:06.120
And actually, I have no
idea what I just said.

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:08.070
But I like making
reference to Nash,

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:10.890
because it makes me feel
quantitative or something.

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:14.810
So that is called
the Nash equilibrium.

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:18.040
The Nash equilibrium, and
what the entire point here is,

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:20.750
the same sort of
process of figuring out

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:24.780
what are the rules of
optimizing tic-tac-toe behavior

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:27.390
can be built upon the
principles of evolution

00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:29.690
to figure out all
sorts of realms

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:32.610
of optimized social behavior.

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:37.150
And broadly, this is a field
that's known as sociobiology,

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:41.549
emerging in the late
1970s-- mid 1970s or so.

00:08:41.549 --> 00:08:43.600
And by the late
1980s, giving birth

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:47.270
to another discipline known
as evolutionary psychology.

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:50.760
The notion that you cannot
understand behavior,

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:54.770
and you cannot understand
internal psychological states,

00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:58.000
outside the context of evolution
had something to do with

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.830
sculpting those behaviors
and those psyches.

00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:04.410
So to start off with that, basic
song and dance about Darwin.

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:06.970
Just to make sure we're
up to speed on this.

00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:09.610
Darwin, just to get some
things out of the way.

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:11.990
Darwin did not
discover evolution.

00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:14.490
People knew about
evolution long before that.

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:16.970
Darwin came up with the
notion of a mechanism

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:18.890
for evolution,
natural selection.

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:22.640
And in fact, Darwin is
the inventor of that.

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:24.970
There was another guy,
Alfred Russel Wallace,

00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:25.830
the two of them.

00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:28.710
And, for some reason, Wallace
has gotten screwed historically

00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:30.460
and Darwin gets
much more attention.

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:34.640
But starting off with a
Darwinian view of how evolution

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:35.850
works.

00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:38.270
First thing being that
there is evolution.

00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:41.900
Traits in populations
change over time.

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:44.470
Traits can change enough
that, in fact, you

00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:45.830
will get speciation.

00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:47.560
New species will form.

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:50.560
And the logic of
Darwinian evolution

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:55.460
is built on just a few couple
of very reasonable steps.

00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:59.980
First one is that there are
traits that are heritable.

00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:03.570
Traits that could be passed
on one generation to the next.

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:05.470
Traits that we
now can translate,

00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:09.190
in our modern parlance, into
traits that are genetic.

00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:12.040
And we will see, soon, how
that's totally not correct

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:12.920
to have said that.

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:15.420
But traits that are heritable.

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:20.280
The next thing is that there is
variability among those traits.

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:24.470
There's different ways in
which this trait can occur,

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:26.800
and they're all heritable.

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:28.640
The next critical thing.

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:33.750
Some versions of those traits
are more adaptive than others.

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:36.530
Some versions work
better for you.

00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:39.280
For example, giraffe
who wind up with hearts

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:42.850
the size of, like, a tomato,
that's not an optimal version.

00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:45.490
Amid the range of
variability, some

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:49.370
will carry with them more
fitness, more adaptiveness,

00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:50.720
than others.

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:53.520
And that translates
into another sound bite

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.160
that's got to be gotten rid of.

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:59.410
All of this is not about
survival of the most adapted.

00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:01.610
It's about reproduction,
something we will

00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:03.280
come to over and over again.

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:05.680
It's about the number
of copies of genes you

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:07.270
leave in the next generation.

00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:09.510
So you've got to have
traits that are heritable.

00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:12.000
There's got to be
variability in them.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.770
Some of those traits are
more adaptive than others.

00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:16.160
Some of those
traits make it more

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:19.870
likely that that organism
passes on copies of its genes

00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:21.260
into the next generation.

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.560
And throw those three pieces
together, and what you will get

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:26.910
is evolution in populations.

00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:29.380
Changing frequencies of traits.

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:32.160
And when you throw in one
additional piece, which

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:34.480
is every now and
then the possibility

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:37.960
to have a random introduction
of a new type of trait

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:42.000
in there-- modern parlance,
a mutation-- from that,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.610
you can begin to get actual
large changes in what

00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:47.600
a population looks like.

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:50.760
OK, so these are the basic
building blocks of Darwin.

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:53.220
And it is easy to apply
it to giraffes' hearts

00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:56.320
and kidneys of desert rats,
and everything we think about

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:59.390
in the world of
physiology, anatomy,

00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:01.590
in the context of evolution.

00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:04.180
So how do you apply
it to behavior?

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:06.390
And the basic notion,
for folks who've

00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:07.980
come from this
Darwinian tradition

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:11.150
into thinking about behavior,
is you do the exact same thing.

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:15.940
There are behaviors that are
heritable, types, traits,

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:17.390
classes of behaviors.

00:12:17.390 --> 00:12:20.990
They come with a certain degree
of variation among individuals.

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:24.730
Some versions of them are
more adaptive than others.

00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:27.110
Over time, the more
adaptive versions

00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:28.990
will become more commonplace.

00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:31.250
And every now and then,
you can have mutations

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:33.340
that introduce new variability.

00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:36.600
Totally logical,
absolutely unassailable.

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:39.120
And what we're going to spend
an insane amount of time

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:42.180
in this class on is
one simple assumption

00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:46.180
in there, which is that certain
behaviors are heritable.

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:48.930
That certain behaviors
have genetic components.

00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:50.560
And as you'll see,
this one is just

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:53.170
going to run through
every lecture wrestling

00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:54.560
with that issue there.

00:12:54.560 --> 00:13:00.155
This is a big incendiary issue
there as to how genetic--

00:13:00.155 --> 00:13:01.780
and that's not the
same thing as saying

00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:06.630
how genetically determined--
how genetic behavior is.

00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:10.110
So that's going to be an
issue we come back to again

00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:11.060
and again.

00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:14.030
So now, transitioning
into how you would apply

00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:16.520
these Darwinian principles.

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:19.470
First thing before
starting, a caveat.

00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:21.730
You're going to wind up,
in order to think about all

00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:25.100
of this most efficiently,
hopefully do some personifying.

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:28.500
Personifying as in, you'll
sit around saying, well,

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:30.824
what would a female
chimpanzee want

00:13:30.824 --> 00:13:32.990
to do at this point to
optimize the number of copies

00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:34.690
of her genes in the
next generation?

00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:37.000
What would this
brine shrimp want

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.360
to do to deal with this
environmental stressor?

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:42.630
What would this cherry tree do?

00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:43.810
They're not planning.

00:13:43.810 --> 00:13:44.770
They're not conscious.

00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:47.230
They're not taking classes
in evolutionary biology.

00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:49.570
What would this
organism want to do

00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:53.380
is just a shorthand
for something sculpted

00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:56.210
by the sort of
exigencies of evolution,

00:13:56.210 --> 00:13:58.520
and reducing the optimal.

00:13:58.520 --> 00:13:59.700
They want to do this.

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:01.790
This is just going to be
a short hand throughout.

00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:04.120
Once you get past
the apes, nobody

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:07.000
is wanting to do any of
these optimization things.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.230
So just getting that sort of
terminology out of the way.

00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:13.150
OK, so we start off with
what's the first building

00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:17.450
block of applying Darwinian
principles to behavior.

00:14:17.450 --> 00:14:20.332
Something that is absolutely
critical to emphasize,

00:14:20.332 --> 00:14:22.040
because the first
thing we all need to do

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:25.930
is unlearn something we all
learned back when on all those

00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:29.870
National Geographic specials
and that would consistently

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:32.330
teach us something about
this aspect of evolution,

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:34.910
and would always
teach it to us wrong.

00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:36.200
Here's the scenario.

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:39.000
So you're watching, and there's
this wildlife documentary.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.730
It's dawn on the savanna.

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:44.370
And you see, there's
a whole bunch lions

00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:46.640
on top of some big
old dead thing.

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:48.220
Some buffalo, or something.

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:53.040
And they're chewing away
and having a fine time.

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:55.730
So something happens
at that point,

00:14:55.730 --> 00:15:01.000
which is, they have to deal
with how they divvy up the food.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.680
Or let me give you
another example.

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:05.370
Another standard, sort
of endless vignette

00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:07.630
that comes up in these films.

00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:09.750
Once again, now, you're
back on the savanna.

00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:11.580
It's not dawn this
time, but you are

00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:13.700
looking at one of the
magnificent things

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:17.410
of the natural world, which
is the migration of zebras

00:15:17.410 --> 00:15:18.490
throughout East Africa.

00:15:18.490 --> 00:15:21.730
A herd of 2 million of them
migrate around, following

00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:23.780
a cyclical pattern of rains.

00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:26.120
So they're always going
where the grass is greener.

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:28.740
So you've got this wonderful
herd of 2 million wildebeest,

00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:30.360
and there's a problem.

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:33.230
Which is, there's some great
field right in front of them

00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:35.870
full of grass, and
bummer, there's

00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:38.370
a river in between them
and the next field.

00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:42.290
And especially a bummer, a
river teeming with crocodiles

00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:44.050
just ready to grab them.

00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:47.000
So what are the
wildebeest going to do?

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.900
And according to the
National Geographic type

00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:52.640
specials we would get,
out would come a solution.

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:55.230
There's all the wildebeest
hemming and hawing

00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:58.090
in this agitated state
by the edge of the river.

00:15:58.090 --> 00:16:00.830
And suddenly, from
the back of the crowd,

00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:04.510
comes this elderly wildebeest
who pushes his way up

00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:06.560
to the front, stands on
the edge of the river

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:08.980
and says, I sacrifice
myself for you,

00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:11.500
meine kinder, and throws
himself into the river--

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:12.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.120
--where immediately, the
crocs get busy eating him up.

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:16.686
And the other two
million wildebeest

00:16:16.686 --> 00:16:18.810
could tiptoe around the
other way across the river,

00:16:18.810 --> 00:16:20.020
and everybody is fine.

00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:23.380
And you're then saying,
why'd this guy do this?

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:25.700
Why did this guy fling
himself into the river?

00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:29.050
And we would get the
answer at that point.

00:16:29.050 --> 00:16:33.120
The answer that is permeated
as, like, the worst urban myth

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:34.130
of evolution.

00:16:34.130 --> 00:16:34.700
Whatever.

00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:36.300
Why did he do that?

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:40.710
Because animals behave for
the good of the species.

00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:43.940
This is the notion that has
to be completely trashed right

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:44.600
now.

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:47.190
Animals behaving for
the good of the species

00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:50.510
really came to the forefront,
a guy in the early 60s named

00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:51.750
Wynne-Edwards.

00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:53.450
Hyphenated, Wynne-Edwards.

00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:57.830
Some hyphenated Brit zoologist,
who pushed most strongly

00:16:57.830 --> 00:17:01.220
this notion of
that animals behave

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:03.770
for the good of the species.

00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:07.540
He is reviled throughout
every textbook, Wynne-Edwards

00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:08.569
and group selection.

00:17:08.569 --> 00:17:10.339
That would be the
term, selection

00:17:10.339 --> 00:17:12.400
for the good of groups,
for the selection

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:13.690
for the good of the species.

00:17:13.690 --> 00:17:15.770
Wynne-Edwards and
group selection.

00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:18.980
I'm sure the guy did all
sorts of other useful things.

00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:22.366
And anyone who really has any
depth to them would find out.

00:17:22.366 --> 00:17:24.240
But all I know is that
the guy is the one who

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:26.079
came up with group selection.

00:17:26.079 --> 00:17:29.520
Animals behave for the
good of the species.

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:31.610
This isn't the case at all.

00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:36.230
Animals behave for passing on
as many copies of their genes

00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:37.350
as possible.

00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:39.380
And what we'll see
is, when you start

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:42.170
looking at the nuances
of that, sometimes it

00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:45.220
may look like behaving for
the good of the species.

00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:47.820
But it really isn't the case.

00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:51.250
So animals behave
in order to maximize

00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:52.682
the number of
copies of genes they

00:17:52.682 --> 00:17:53.890
leave in the next generation.

00:17:53.890 --> 00:17:55.980
Remember, not survival
of the fittest,

00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:57.690
reproduction of the fittest.

00:17:57.690 --> 00:18:01.220
So first thing you need to do
is go back to that vignette

00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:04.460
and saying, so what's up
with the wildebeest there?

00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:07.120
And what's up with the elderly
guy who jumps in the river?

00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:10.160
And finally, when you
look at them long enough

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:12.660
instead of the camera crew
showing up for three minutes,

00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:14.640
when you studied
this closely enough,

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:17.350
you see something that
wasn't apparent at first.

00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:19.820
Which is, this
elderly wildebeest

00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:22.460
is not fighting his
way through the crowd.

00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:24.695
This guy is being
pushed from behind.

00:18:24.695 --> 00:18:25.330
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:27.047
This guy is being
pushed from behind,

00:18:27.047 --> 00:18:28.630
because all the other
ones are saying,

00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:30.820
yeah, get the old
guy on the river.

00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:32.710
Sacrificing himself, my ass.

00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:35.540
This guy is getting pushed
in by everybody else.

00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:38.550
He is not sacrificing himself
for the good of the species.

00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:41.280
He does not like the
idea of this whatsoever.

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:44.320
So he gets pushed in
because the old, weak guy.

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:46.530
None of this group
selection stuff.

00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:49.680
What came in by the
'70s as a replacement,

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:53.370
a way to think about this,
is this notion of animals,

00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:56.020
including us, behaving not
for the good of the species

00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:58.770
or of the group, but to maximize
the number of copies of genes

00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:00.540
left in the next generation.

00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:04.640
And what you see is three ways
in which this could occur.

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:06.420
Three building blocks.

00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:10.980
The first one being known
as individual selection.

00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:13.160
The first one, built
around the notion

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:15.680
that sometimes the
behavior of an animal

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:19.060
is meant to optimize the
number of copies of its genes

00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:21.190
that it leaves in
the next generation

00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:23.580
by itself reproducing.

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:25.650
The drive to
reproduce, the drive

00:19:25.650 --> 00:19:27.810
to leave more copies
of one's genes.

00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:32.450
This was once summarized
really sort of tersely as,

00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:37.820
sometimes a chicken is an egg's
way of making another chicken.

00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:39.610
No, that's backwards.

00:19:39.610 --> 00:19:44.360
Sometimes a chicken is an egg's
way of making another egg.

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:46.990
OK, ignore that.

00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:50.820
What the guy said is, sometimes
a chicken is an egg's way

00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:52.150
of making another egg.

00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:57.160
All this behavior stuff,
and all this animate social

00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:59.480
interaction, is just
an epiphenomenon

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:03.810
to get more copies of the
genes into the next generation.

00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:07.570
Individual selection, a subset
of way of thinking about this

00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:09.380
is selfish genes.

00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:12.120
What behavior is
about is maximizing

00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:14.880
the number of copies of
genes in the next generation.

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:17.770
And sometimes the best
way to do it, sometimes

00:20:17.770 --> 00:20:21.140
the way that animals maximize,
is to get as many copies

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:23.430
by way of reproducing
themselves.

00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:25.700
It's not quite equivalent
to The Selfish Gene,

00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:29.460
but for our purposes,
individual selection.

00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:31.970
And this can play out
in a number of realms.

00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:34.450
And bringing in sort
of a big dichotomy

00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:37.040
in thinking about
evolutionary pressures, Darwin

00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:39.170
and the theory of
natural selection.

00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:41.830
What natural
selection is about is

00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:46.230
processes bringing about an
organism who is more adaptive,

00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:47.440
what we just went through.

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:50.860
Darwin soon recognized there
was a second realm of selection,

00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:52.920
which he called
sexual selection.

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:55.150
And what that one's
about is, this

00:20:55.150 --> 00:20:57.080
is selecting for
traits that have

00:20:57.080 --> 00:21:01.580
no value whatsoever in terms of
survival or anything like that.

00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:03.800
Traits that carry
no adaptive value,

00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:07.940
but for some random, bizarre
reason, the opposite sex

00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:09.930
likes folks who look this way.

00:21:09.930 --> 00:21:12.900
So they get to leave more
copies of their genes.

00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:16.350
And suddenly, you could have
natural selection bringing

00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:19.750
about big, sharp
antlers in male moose,

00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:23.440
and they use that for fighting
off predators or fighting

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:24.060
with a male.

00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:26.090
That would be natural selection.

00:21:26.090 --> 00:21:28.610
Sexual selection might
account for the fact

00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:32.270
that the antlers are
green, paisley patterns all

00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:33.020
over for that.

00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:35.410
And for some reason,
that looks cool.

00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:38.560
The female moose is,
and what you wind up

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:40.820
getting as a mechanism
for sexual selection

00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:45.550
is, as long as individuals
prefer to mate with individuals

00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:48.990
with some completely
arbitrary traits,

00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:51.690
those traits will also
become more common.

00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:54.470
So this dichotomy
of natural selection

00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:58.080
for traits driven by
traits that really do

00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:01.520
aid leaving copies of genes
outside the realm of just

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:04.390
sheer sexual preference,
sexual selection.

00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:07.480
And sometimes they can go in
absolutely opposite directions.

00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:12.230
You can get some species
where the female fish

00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:15.330
prefer male fish that have
very bright coloration.

00:22:15.330 --> 00:22:18.070
And that's advantageous, then,
to have the bright coloration

00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:19.680
by means of sexual selection.

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:21.310
But the bright
coloration makes you

00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:23.930
more likely to get predated
by some other fish.

00:22:23.930 --> 00:22:27.130
Natural selection pushing
against bright coloration

00:22:27.130 --> 00:22:27.770
in males.

00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:31.190
Very often, you've got the
two going against each other,

00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:32.790
having to balance.

00:22:32.790 --> 00:22:35.050
So how would that be
applied in this realm

00:22:35.050 --> 00:22:36.840
of individual selection?

00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:38.560
This first building block.

00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:41.450
Sometimes an egg-- damn.

00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:44.120
Sometimes a chicken is an egg's
way of making another egg.

00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:47.480
Sometimes what behavior is
about is one individual trying

00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:49.620
to maximize the number
of copies of their genes

00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:50.740
in the next generation.

00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:53.060
A natural selection
manifestation of it

00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:56.260
being, you're good at
running away from predators.

00:22:56.260 --> 00:23:00.180
Selection for speed, for certain
types of muscle metabolism,

00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:03.180
for certain sets of sensory
systems that will tell you

00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:04.950
there's somebody scary around.

00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:07.170
That would be the realm of that.

00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:10.710
Individual selection, selecting
the realm of sexual selection

00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:14.170
to have more of whatever those
traits that are attractive.

00:23:14.170 --> 00:23:17.610
So this first building block,
it's not group selection.

00:23:17.610 --> 00:23:19.590
It's not behaving for
the good of the species.

00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:22.360
It's behaving to maximize the
number of copies of one's genes

00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:23.460
in the next generation.

00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:25.250
And the most
straightforward way is

00:23:25.250 --> 00:23:28.380
to behave in a way to
maximize the number of times

00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:31.000
you reproduce yourself.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.820
Second building
block, which is, there

00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:37.340
is another way of accomplishing
the same thing that you just

00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:40.490
did with individual
selection, as follows.

00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:42.890
One of the things that
can be relied upon in life

00:23:42.890 --> 00:23:45.470
is that you are related
to your relatives.

00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:49.930
And what you get is, the
more closely related you are,

00:23:49.930 --> 00:23:52.600
the more genes you share
in common with them.

00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:55.030
On a statistical
level, identical twins

00:23:55.030 --> 00:23:57.650
share 100% of their genes.

00:23:57.650 --> 00:23:59.540
Full siblings, 50%.

00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:01.210
Half siblings, 25%.

00:24:01.210 --> 00:24:02.800
This is exactly
something that's going

00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:05.080
to be covered in the catch
up section this week.

00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:07.680
If you're not comfortable with
this stuff, this sort of thing

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:09.290
will be reviewed in more detail.

00:24:09.290 --> 00:24:14.010
OK, so the closer a
relative is to you,

00:24:14.010 --> 00:24:17.550
the more genes they
share in common with you.

00:24:17.550 --> 00:24:19.540
So suddenly, you've
got this issue.

00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:22.510
You're an identical twin
and your identical sibling

00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:24.800
has the same genes that you do.

00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:28.830
Individual selection, you
will be just as successful

00:24:28.830 --> 00:24:32.050
as passing on copies of your
genes into the next generation

00:24:32.050 --> 00:24:35.300
if you forgo
reproducing to make it

00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:38.120
possible for your
identical twin to do so.

00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:40.920
Because on the level
of just sheer numbers

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:43.330
of copies of genes in
the next generation,

00:24:43.330 --> 00:24:45.180
they are equivalent.

00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:49.290
And sometimes, you will thus get
behavior which really decreases

00:24:49.290 --> 00:24:52.370
the reproductive
success of an individual

00:24:52.370 --> 00:24:56.570
in order to enhance the
success of a relative.

00:24:56.570 --> 00:24:58.560
But you've got a
constraint there,

00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:00.770
which is, all of
your relatives don't

00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:02.630
share all your genes with you.

00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:05.870
They have differing
degrees of relatedness.

00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:09.070
And what that winds up
producing is another factor,

00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:10.220
another observation.

00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:13.430
One of the great, witty
geneticists of all time, a guy

00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:16.050
named Haldane who,
apparently, once in a bar

00:25:16.050 --> 00:25:18.190
was trying to explain
this principle to somebody

00:25:18.190 --> 00:25:20.530
and came up and
said, I will gladly

00:25:20.530 --> 00:25:24.350
lay down my life for two
brothers or eight cousins.

00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:27.190
And that's the math
of the relatedness.

00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:30.090
You passing on one
copy of your genes

00:25:30.090 --> 00:25:34.550
to the next generation is, from
the sheer mathematics of just

00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:37.500
how evolution is going to
play out over the generations,

00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:43.020
is exactly equivalent as giving
up your life for eight cousins

00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:45.900
to be able to each pass
on a copy of their genes.

00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:47.610
Because you share 1/8
with each of them,

00:25:47.610 --> 00:25:49.360
and it winds up being
a whole [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:51.340
And it's that math.

00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:53.600
And out of that, you
get something that

00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:55.580
makes perfect sense instantly.

00:25:55.580 --> 00:25:59.760
Which is, evolution selects
for organisms cooperating

00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:01.710
with their relatives.

00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:03.300
Something along those lines.

00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:05.690
And thus we have this
second building block

00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:08.140
known as kin selection.

00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:09.560
Inclusive fitness.

00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:10.800
Kin selection.

00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:14.760
First building block, individual
selection, passing on copies

00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:18.010
of your own genes as a way
to maximize future success.

00:26:18.010 --> 00:26:21.160
Second version,
helping out relatives.

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:24.700
Helping out relatives
in terms of increasing

00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:28.590
their reproductive success
with this vicious mathematical

00:26:28.590 --> 00:26:32.620
logic, which is
one identical twin

00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:36.270
to have two full siblings,
eight cousins, and so on,

00:26:36.270 --> 00:26:38.980
as a function of
degree of relatedness.

00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:42.570
And what this begins to
explain is a whole world

00:26:42.570 --> 00:26:47.150
in animal behavior of animals
being obsessed with kinship.

00:26:47.150 --> 00:26:51.910
Animals being fully aware of
who is related to who in what

00:26:51.910 --> 00:26:53.090
sorts of ways.

00:26:53.090 --> 00:26:55.520
Animals being
utterly aware of you

00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:58.280
cooperate with relatives,
but as a function of how

00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:00.620
closely related they are.

00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:04.570
Animals put us in Social
Anthropology, in kinship terms,

00:27:04.570 --> 00:27:07.490
and could you marry the daughter
of your uncle's third wife

00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:09.480
or whatever, to
shame in terms of how

00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:13.900
much a lot of social animals
deal with relatedness.

00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:16.940
So inclusive fitness,
kin selection.

00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:18.340
Here would be evidence for it.

00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:19.550
Here's one example.

00:27:19.550 --> 00:27:23.830
Very cool study done some years
back by a couple, Seyfarth

00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:25.640
and Cheney, University
of Pennsylvania,

00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:27.170
looking at vervet monkeys.

00:27:27.170 --> 00:27:30.877
And these were vervet monkeys
out in Tanzania, I believe.

00:27:30.877 --> 00:27:33.210
What they did was, a whole
bunch of these vervet monkeys

00:27:33.210 --> 00:27:34.300
were sitting around.

00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:38.060
And they, the researchers,
had made really high quality

00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:41.160
recording recordings of
various vocalizations

00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:42.500
from the monkeys over time.

00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:45.440
So they had the sound of each
animal giving an alarm call,

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:48.260
giving a friendly gesture
call, giving a whatever.

00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:51.070
And what they would then
do is hide a microphone

00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:55.480
inside some bushes and play
the sound of one of the infants

00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:58.870
from the group
giving an alarm call.

00:27:58.870 --> 00:28:01.320
So what does the mother
of that infant do?

00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:04.700
She instantly gets agitated
and looks over at the bush.

00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:06.570
That's her child, all of that.

00:28:06.570 --> 00:28:09.930
How to know that everyone
else in that vervet group

00:28:09.930 --> 00:28:13.440
understands kin selection,
what does everybody else do?

00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:16.310
They all look at the mother.

00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:20.140
That's whoever's mother,
what is she going to do next?

00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:23.680
They understand the
relatedness, and they understand

00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:25.080
what the response will be.

00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:28.630
All the other vervets look
at the mother at that point.

00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:31.540
Whoa, I'm sure glad that's
not my kid giving an alarm

00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:32.810
call from the bushes.

00:28:32.810 --> 00:28:34.840
They understand kinship.

00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:37.640
Another version of that
came out in these studies.

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:41.240
So you've got two females, each
of whom has a kid, a daughter,

00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:41.910
whatever.

00:28:41.910 --> 00:28:45.350
And female A and female
B. And one day, female A

00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:49.900
does something absolutely
rotten to female B.

00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:53.060
And later that day,
the child of female B

00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:56.280
is more likely than chance
to do something rotten

00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:58.910
to the child of
female A. They're

00:28:58.910 --> 00:29:01.330
keeping track of
not only revenge,

00:29:01.330 --> 00:29:03.140
but not revenge on
the individual who

00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:06.530
did something miserable to
you, but displaced by one

00:29:06.530 --> 00:29:08.550
degree of reproduction.

00:29:08.550 --> 00:29:10.560
Keeping track of kinship.

00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:11.810
Animals can do this.

00:29:11.810 --> 00:29:14.250
All sorts of primate
species can do this.

00:29:14.250 --> 00:29:18.370
And as we'll see, all sorts of
other species can do this also.

00:29:18.370 --> 00:29:19.560
There is that caveat again.

00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:22.627
All sorts of other
species want to figure out

00:29:22.627 --> 00:29:24.710
who their cousins-- they
don't want to figure out.

00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:27.210
Evolution has
sculpted an ability

00:29:27.210 --> 00:29:31.000
to optimize behavior
along lines of relatedness

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.150
in all sorts of species.

00:29:33.150 --> 00:29:35.260
So how would natural
selection play out

00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:38.760
in this realm of kin
selection, I will lay down

00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:40.880
my life for eight cousins.

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:43.780
And that's just sort of
obvious there by now.

00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:47.090
How would sexual selection
play out in this realm.

00:29:47.090 --> 00:29:50.030
I am willing to expend
great amounts of energy

00:29:50.030 --> 00:29:54.920
to convince people that my
sibling is incredibly hot.

00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:56.840
And with any
chance, then passing

00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:58.340
on more copies of genes.

00:29:58.340 --> 00:30:02.130
That would be inclusive fitness,
kin selection in both cases.

00:30:02.130 --> 00:30:06.330
Decreasing your own
reproductive potential

00:30:06.330 --> 00:30:09.300
by way of being killed by a
predator to save the 8 cousins,

00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:12.810
or having to spend so much time
haranguing about your sibling.

00:30:12.810 --> 00:30:15.320
Doings that, in
order to increase

00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:18.140
the reproductive
success of relatives,

00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:20.770
where you were willing
to give up more energy

00:30:20.770 --> 00:30:23.870
and potential on your part,
the more closely related

00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:25.960
the individual is.

00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:28.240
So you throw those
two pieces together,

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:29.830
and you're suddenly
off and running

00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:32.610
with explaining a lot
of animal behavior.

00:30:32.610 --> 00:30:34.714
Individual selection,
none of this

00:30:34.714 --> 00:30:35.880
for the good of the species.

00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:39.160
Maximizing the number of
copies of your own genes.

00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:41.800
And the easiest way, the
most straightforward,

00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:45.460
is you yourself
maximizing reproduction.

00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:49.170
Foundation number two the
whole thing, kin selection.

00:30:49.170 --> 00:30:51.830
Sometimes the best way of
leaving more copies of genes

00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:53.930
in the next
generation is using up

00:30:53.930 --> 00:30:56.340
your own reproductive
potential foregoing

00:30:56.340 --> 00:31:00.470
to help relatives as a function
of degree of relatedness.

00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:02.240
OK, that's great.

00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:05.690
So now the third piece, the
third final building block

00:31:05.690 --> 00:31:08.470
of making sense of social
behavior in the context

00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:12.000
of real contemporary
evolutionary theory,

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.610
the third block here.

00:31:13.610 --> 00:31:17.900
Which is, you look at animals
and they're not all just

00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:20.910
competing with non-relatives.

00:31:20.910 --> 00:31:24.890
Animals forego competition
at certain points.

00:31:24.890 --> 00:31:27.140
Animals would have
the potential to be

00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:31.250
aggressive to other animals,
and they will forego doing so.

00:31:31.250 --> 00:31:33.750
And there's one circumstance
in which that can happen,

00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:37.640
where you get what is called a
rock-paper-scissors scenario.

00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:43.410
You've got animals A, B, and
C. A has a means of damaging B,

00:31:43.410 --> 00:31:46.260
but it costs A. B has
a means of damaging C,

00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:47.950
but it costs B. C
can damage A, but it

00:31:47.950 --> 00:31:51.540
costs A. You get the right
distribution of individuals

00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:54.040
with one of those
traits in a population,

00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:57.630
and you will reach a
rock-scissors-paper equilibrium

00:31:57.630 --> 00:32:00.590
where nobody's doing anything
rotten to each other.

00:32:00.590 --> 00:32:03.330
Great example, totally
cool example that got

00:32:03.330 --> 00:32:06.410
published some years ago by a
guy named Brendan Bohannan, who

00:32:06.410 --> 00:32:09.390
was assistant professor in the
department here at the time.

00:32:09.390 --> 00:32:12.470
He was studying something
or other about bacteria

00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:15.430
showing a rock-paper-scissors
circumstance.

00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:18.670
You had three different types,
three different versions,

00:32:18.670 --> 00:32:21.300
of this bacteria in
this colony he had made.

00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:28.040
The first one could generate
a poison, but it cost.

00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:30.400
It had to put the effort
into making that poison

00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:33.280
and protecting itself from
that poison, all of that.

00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:36.310
The second type was
vulnerable to the poison.

00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:39.710
It happened to have some
transporter on its membrane

00:32:39.710 --> 00:32:42.540
that took up the poison,
and that was bad news.

00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:45.540
But it had an advantage,
which is the rest of the time,

00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:49.920
that transporter
took up more food.

00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:51.990
The third one, the
good thing going

00:32:51.990 --> 00:32:55.300
for it is that it didn't
have-- the bad thing

00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:57.630
was, it didn't have poison.

00:32:57.630 --> 00:32:59.440
A good thing going
for it was it didn't

00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:01.370
have to spend
energy on a poison,

00:33:01.370 --> 00:33:03.570
and it didn't have
that transporter.

00:33:03.570 --> 00:33:06.520
So each one of those has a
strength, each one of those

00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:07.680
has a vulnerability.

00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:10.270
They're like, I don't
know, Pokemon or something.

00:33:10.270 --> 00:33:12.110
And you put them
all together there,

00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:14.950
and you get a
rock-paper-scissors scenario

00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:18.130
where you get equilibrium,
where they are not

00:33:18.130 --> 00:33:19.410
attacking each other.

00:33:19.410 --> 00:33:24.200
Because note, if I
am A and I destroy B,

00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:26.730
B's no longer
wiping out C, who's

00:33:26.730 --> 00:33:28.050
the one who could damage me.

00:33:28.050 --> 00:33:30.810
It's got to come to
an equilibrium state.

00:33:30.810 --> 00:33:34.230
So you can get the evolution
of stalemates like that,

00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:36.600
and that's quite
frequently seen.

00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:38.660
And note here, this
was the evolution

00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:43.470
of stalemates not in chimps, not
in cetaceans, but in bacteria.

00:33:43.470 --> 00:33:47.380
What we're going to see
is bacterial behavior,

00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:50.180
to the extent that this is sort
of a metaphor for behavior.

00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:52.970
Behavior of all sorts
of unlikely species

00:33:52.970 --> 00:33:56.280
are subject to these
same rules of passing

00:33:56.280 --> 00:33:57.940
on copies of your genes.

00:33:57.940 --> 00:34:00.260
These three different
strains of bacteria

00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:02.380
are competing with each other.

00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:06.170
None of them are behaving for
the good of the species there

00:34:06.170 --> 00:34:07.630
of the three of them.

00:34:07.630 --> 00:34:09.800
So rock-paper-scissors
is very cool,

00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:12.320
and you get versions
of that in humans.

00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:15.090
That's been sort of studied
quantitatively, all of that.

00:34:15.090 --> 00:34:16.989
But that's not real cooperation.

00:34:16.989 --> 00:34:19.000
That's merely
everybody realizing

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.469
we have to cut back
on the competition.

00:34:21.469 --> 00:34:23.560
We have to cut back
on the aggression.

00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:25.949
Because every time
I damage whoever,

00:34:25.949 --> 00:34:27.929
I am more vulnerable
in another realm.

00:34:27.929 --> 00:34:29.080
That's a stalemate.

00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:30.810
That's a truce.

00:34:30.810 --> 00:34:33.480
But you look at animals,
and in all sorts of realms,

00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:35.870
it's not just
rock-paper-scissors stalemates

00:34:35.870 --> 00:34:36.600
they're reaching.

00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:39.000
They actually cooperate
with each other.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:43.170
And you look close enough, and
you see they're not relatives.

00:34:43.170 --> 00:34:45.409
They're not
relatives, yet you get

00:34:45.409 --> 00:34:47.719
all sorts of
altruistic behavior,

00:34:47.719 --> 00:34:51.090
and you've got it under
a whole bunch of domains.

00:34:51.090 --> 00:34:52.690
Because this brings
up the question,

00:34:52.690 --> 00:34:55.170
why should you
ever be cooperative

00:34:55.170 --> 00:34:57.520
with another individual if
you are a social animal.

00:34:57.520 --> 00:35:01.240
At every possibility, you
should stab them in the back

00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:02.390
and be selfish.

00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:04.100
And the reason why
that isn't a good idea

00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:06.660
is, there's all sorts
of circumstances where

00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:09.100
many hands make the task light.

00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:14.120
Or whatever that is, cooperation
can have synergistic benefits.

00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:16.190
And you see that
with species that

00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:19.360
are cooperative hunters,
where they are not necessarily

00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:20.110
relatives.

00:35:20.110 --> 00:35:22.310
They will chase one,
chasing an animal

00:35:22.310 --> 00:35:25.100
while the other is getting
ready to cut a corner on it.

00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:28.750
Cooperative behavior, and
they increase the likelihood

00:35:28.750 --> 00:35:30.570
of them getting a kill.

00:35:30.570 --> 00:35:32.130
Another example of this.

00:35:32.130 --> 00:35:33.960
Research by a guy
named Mark Hauser

00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:36.550
at Harvard looking
at rhesus monkeys.

00:35:36.550 --> 00:35:38.940
And what he showed was,
he would put these monkeys

00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:42.530
in a situation where
they had access to food.

00:35:42.530 --> 00:35:45.360
They had access to food
under one circumstance,

00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:50.200
where they could reach for it
and take it in and share it

00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:52.100
with another monkey.

00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:56.040
Under the other circumstance,
it required two monkeys

00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:57.730
to get the food in there.

00:35:57.730 --> 00:36:01.070
And what he showed was
clear cut reciprocity.

00:36:01.070 --> 00:36:03.780
Monkeys who were
sharing with this guy

00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:05.720
were more likely to
get shared back with

00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:09.170
and got more cooperation when
it was a task where two of them

00:36:09.170 --> 00:36:11.230
had to work together
to get the food.

00:36:11.230 --> 00:36:12.780
One alone wasn't enough.

00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:15.860
Many hands make the task
lighter under all sorts

00:36:15.860 --> 00:36:17.100
of circumstances.

00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:21.070
Cooperation has a strong
evolutionary payoff,

00:36:21.070 --> 00:36:25.680
even among non-relatives,
with a condition.

00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:28.050
Which is, you're not
putting more into it

00:36:28.050 --> 00:36:29.560
than you are getting.

00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:31.500
That is reciprocal.

00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:35.100
And ' opens up the third
building block of all of this,

00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:38.650
which is reciprocal altruism.

00:36:38.650 --> 00:36:42.610
Cooperation, altruistic
behavior among non-relatives,

00:36:42.610 --> 00:36:46.040
but undergoing very
strict constraints of,

00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:50.750
it's gotta be reciprocated with
all sorts of rules like that.

00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:53.630
So what does that look like.

00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:55.560
You're going to see
reciprocal altruism,

00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:56.800
when would you see that.

00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:59.160
What's the immediate
thing, what sort of species

00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:02.400
would show systems of
reciprocal cooperation

00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:03.940
among non-relatives.

00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:05.500
They've got to be smart animals.

00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:06.700
They've got to be social.

00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:07.700
They've got to be smart.

00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:08.908
Why do they have to be smart?

00:37:08.908 --> 00:37:10.610
Because they have
to remember, this

00:37:10.610 --> 00:37:13.880
is the guy who owes me a
favor from last Thursday.

00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:16.680
They need to be able to
recognize individuals.

00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:19.340
They have to be long lived
enough so that there's

00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:21.670
a chance of interacting
with that individual

00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:24.520
again and establishing
this reciprocity.

00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:26.640
You would thus
predict you would see

00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:30.350
systems of reciprocal
altruism only in long

00:37:30.350 --> 00:37:33.530
lived social vertebrates.

00:37:33.530 --> 00:37:37.780
But you see the exact sorts
of things in bacteria.

00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:40.520
You see the exact sort
of things in fungi.

00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:42.670
You see that in all
sorts of other realms.

00:37:42.670 --> 00:37:45.820
You get social bacteria,
colonizing bacteria.

00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:49.040
And where what you might
get are two clonal lines

00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:50.380
that are together.

00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:54.460
In other words, two
genetically-- two lines,

00:37:54.460 --> 00:37:56.540
each of which is,
all the bacteria

00:37:56.540 --> 00:37:57.870
have the same genetic makeup.

00:37:57.870 --> 00:38:00.900
So think of it as one individual
who's just kind of dispersed.

00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:02.850
Another one who's just
kind of dispersed.

00:38:02.850 --> 00:38:05.300
And they've come
together in something

00:38:05.300 --> 00:38:09.260
called a fruiting body, which
is how bacteria reproduce

00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:10.080
or whatever.

00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:13.730
And there's two parts
to a fruiting body.

00:38:13.730 --> 00:38:15.730
There's one which
is the stalk, which

00:38:15.730 --> 00:38:17.680
attaches to something or other.

00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:20.880
And then there is the
part that actually fruits.

00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:23.589
So you want to be in
the fruiting part,

00:38:23.589 --> 00:38:25.630
because that's the part
that actually reproduces,

00:38:25.630 --> 00:38:28.470
and the stalk is doing
all the work there.

00:38:28.470 --> 00:38:32.470
And what you see is
attempts at cheating.

00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:34.510
Attempts at one of
these strains trying

00:38:34.510 --> 00:38:37.440
to disproportionately wind
up in the fruiting part,

00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:39.860
and what you also
see is, the next time

00:38:39.860 --> 00:38:43.340
around, this other strain
will not cooperate with it.

00:38:43.340 --> 00:38:45.960
Will not form a social colony.

00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:48.810
So that's getting played off
at the level of single cell

00:38:48.810 --> 00:38:51.480
organisms forming
big social colonies.

00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:52.910
Getting played at that level.

00:38:52.910 --> 00:38:56.150
Yes, as we will see,
reciprocal altruism

00:38:56.150 --> 00:38:58.600
works most readily
in big, smart, long

00:38:58.600 --> 00:38:59.820
lived social beasts.

00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:03.830
But it can occur in
all sorts of systems.

00:39:03.830 --> 00:39:08.790
What it's built around is
reciprocal cooperation.

00:39:08.790 --> 00:39:11.770
And intrinsic in that it
is another motivation going

00:39:11.770 --> 00:39:12.270
on there.

00:39:12.270 --> 00:39:14.670
Not just to involve the
reciprocal relationship

00:39:14.670 --> 00:39:17.420
with a non-relative, and
many hands, and light tasks,

00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:18.090
and all of that.

00:39:18.090 --> 00:39:21.630
But also, whenever
possible, to cheat.

00:39:21.630 --> 00:39:24.570
To take advantage of
the other individual.

00:39:24.570 --> 00:39:26.920
And thus, another
key facet of it

00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:29.700
is to be very good at
detecting when somebody

00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:31.630
is cheating against you.

00:39:31.630 --> 00:39:34.760
To be vigilant about
cheating in what

00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:38.850
would otherwise be a stable,
reciprocal relationship.

00:39:38.850 --> 00:39:42.020
And an awful lot
of social behavior

00:39:42.020 --> 00:39:44.710
is built around
animals either trying

00:39:44.710 --> 00:39:47.600
to get away with something
or spotting somebody else

00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:48.700
doing the same.

00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:49.850
An example of it.

00:39:49.850 --> 00:39:52.920
There is a test that's used
in evolutionary psychology

00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:55.730
where you are given this
very complicated story,

00:39:55.730 --> 00:39:58.280
or another version of a
complicated story, where

00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:01.217
somebody promises if you do
this, you'll get this reward.

00:40:01.217 --> 00:40:03.550
But if you do that, you're
going to get this punishment.

00:40:03.550 --> 00:40:05.250
And really complex.

00:40:05.250 --> 00:40:07.830
And one outcome,
the outcome of it

00:40:07.830 --> 00:40:10.570
is, the person isn't
supposed to get rewarded.

00:40:10.570 --> 00:40:13.740
But the individual
decides to reward them.

00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:15.720
Spontaneous act of kindness.

00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:17.370
In another
circumstance, the person

00:40:17.370 --> 00:40:19.720
is the individual who is
supposed to get rewarded,

00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:21.930
and instead, they get punished.

00:40:21.930 --> 00:40:23.500
A cheater in that case.

00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:25.970
And amid these
convoluted stories,

00:40:25.970 --> 00:40:29.860
people are much
better-- 75% to 25%--

00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:32.940
are much better at detecting
when cheating has gone

00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:36.660
on in the story than when a
random act of kindness has gone

00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:37.350
on.

00:40:37.350 --> 00:40:39.780
We are more attuned to
picking up cheating.

00:40:39.780 --> 00:40:42.940
And remarkably, some
very subtle studies

00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:44.690
have been done
with chimps showing

00:40:44.690 --> 00:40:46.750
that chimps have the same bias.

00:40:46.750 --> 00:40:48.550
They are much
better at picking up

00:40:48.550 --> 00:40:52.160
social interactions involving
cheating than ones that

00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:55.390
involve spontaneous altruism.

00:40:55.390 --> 00:40:59.430
So you see here, this
balance between cooperation,

00:40:59.430 --> 00:41:01.480
reciprocal, even
among non-relatives.

00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:03.100
And that's great,
but you should cheat

00:41:03.100 --> 00:41:04.350
when you can get away with it.

00:41:04.350 --> 00:41:06.200
But you should be
vigilant against cheaters.

00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:08.210
And what, of course,
it comes down to then

00:41:08.210 --> 00:41:12.210
is tic-tac-toe and giraffe
hearts and all of that.

00:41:12.210 --> 00:41:16.560
What is the optimal strategy
in a particular social species

00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:18.020
for a particular individual.

00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:19.930
What is the optimal strategy.

00:41:19.930 --> 00:41:23.780
When do you cooperate
and when do you cheat.

00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:27.360
When do you defect on the
cooperative relationship

00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:28.390
you've had.

00:41:28.390 --> 00:41:31.230
And this introduces
us to a whole world

00:41:31.230 --> 00:41:35.510
of mathematics built around
what is called game theory.

00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:39.170
The notion that there are
games, formal games, that

00:41:39.170 --> 00:41:43.180
have mathematically
optimal strategies,

00:41:43.180 --> 00:41:46.170
or multiple strategies,
multi-equilibrium.

00:41:46.170 --> 00:41:48.110
And a whole world
of research has

00:41:48.110 --> 00:41:52.160
been built around them in
terms of when to cooperate

00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:54.220
and when to defect.

00:41:54.220 --> 00:41:55.990
So game theory stuff.

00:41:55.990 --> 00:41:59.580
This was starting off
in a world of people

00:41:59.580 --> 00:42:02.910
studying economics, and
negotiation, and diplomacy,

00:42:02.910 --> 00:42:03.820
and all of that.

00:42:03.820 --> 00:42:06.540
And that was a whole world
built around this logic

00:42:06.540 --> 00:42:09.080
of when do you cooperate,
when do you cheat.

00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:11.370
And what came out of
there were all sorts

00:42:11.370 --> 00:42:15.420
of models of how to optimize
behavior in terms of that.

00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:19.160
And the building block, sort of
the fruit fly of game theory,

00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:23.050
is a game called the
prisoner's dilemma.

00:42:23.050 --> 00:42:26.950
Prisoner's dilemma, sort of
cutting to-- sort of getting

00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:27.880
rid of the details.

00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:31.740
Two individuals are
prisoners, and they escape,

00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:33.440
and they're both captured.

00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:35.970
And they're
interrogated separately.

00:42:35.970 --> 00:42:39.260
And both of them refuse to
talk, that's great for them.

00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:41.520
If they both squeal,
they both get punished.

00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:43.731
If one of them is able to
squeal on the other one,

00:42:43.731 --> 00:42:44.730
they get a great reward.

00:42:44.730 --> 00:42:46.730
If the other one--
what you get formally

00:42:46.730 --> 00:42:49.560
are four possible outcomes.

00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:54.360
Both individuals
cooperate, both individuals

00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:59.360
cheat against each other,
individual A cooperates and B

00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:03.710
cheats, individual B
cooperates and A cheats.

00:43:03.710 --> 00:43:05.330
And what you get in
prisoner's dilemma

00:43:05.330 --> 00:43:07.400
is a formal payoff for each.

00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:10.670
What gives you the
greatest payoff, stabbing

00:43:10.670 --> 00:43:12.210
the other guy in the back.

00:43:12.210 --> 00:43:14.360
You cheat and they cooperate.

00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:17.610
You have exploited them, you
have taken advantage of them,

00:43:17.610 --> 00:43:18.920
isn't that wonderful.

00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:22.290
That's the highest payoff
in prisoner dilemma games.

00:43:22.290 --> 00:43:26.800
Second highest payoff,
you both cooperate.

00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:29.074
Third highest payoff--
which is beginning

00:43:29.074 --> 00:43:31.740
to not count as a payoff, but in
a lot of the games, this set up

00:43:31.740 --> 00:43:34.030
is the start of
punishment-- both of you

00:43:34.030 --> 00:43:36.640
cheat on each other.

00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:40.820
Fourth worst possible
payoff is you're the sucker.

00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:42.740
You cooperate, and
the other individual

00:43:42.740 --> 00:43:44.570
stabs you in the back.

00:43:44.570 --> 00:43:46.290
So what the prisoner's
dilemma game

00:43:46.290 --> 00:43:50.670
is set up these circumstances
where individuals will play

00:43:50.670 --> 00:43:54.430
versions of this against each
other with varying rewards

00:43:54.430 --> 00:43:56.780
and that sort of thing,
and parameters that we will

00:43:56.780 --> 00:43:58.340
look at in a lot of detail.

00:43:58.340 --> 00:44:01.510
And seeing when is it
optimal to cooperate,

00:44:01.510 --> 00:44:03.910
when is it optimal to cheat.

00:44:03.910 --> 00:44:05.590
When would you do this.

00:44:05.590 --> 00:44:07.740
So you've got examples
of this, and this

00:44:07.740 --> 00:44:09.390
was the building block.

00:44:09.390 --> 00:44:12.010
And what anyone would
say looking at this is,

00:44:12.010 --> 00:44:13.230
it's obvious.

00:44:13.230 --> 00:44:15.680
What you want to
do is, in some way,

00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:18.880
rationally maximize your payoff.

00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:22.490
This whole world
of Homo economists,

00:44:22.490 --> 00:44:25.550
the notion of humans as being
purely rational decision

00:44:25.550 --> 00:44:26.190
makers.

00:44:26.190 --> 00:44:29.520
And what you begin to see in
this world of game theory is,

00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:31.846
there is anything
but that going on.

00:44:31.846 --> 00:44:33.470
Later in the course,
we're going to see

00:44:33.470 --> 00:44:35.170
something very interesting.

00:44:35.170 --> 00:44:38.320
People playing prisoner's
dilemma games inside a brain

00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:40.760
scanner, looking at a
part of the brain that

00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:42.990
has a lot to do with pleasure.

00:44:42.990 --> 00:44:45.710
And what you see
is, some individuals

00:44:45.710 --> 00:44:48.580
activate that part of the brain
when they have successfully

00:44:48.580 --> 00:44:50.470
stabbed the other
guy in the back.

00:44:50.470 --> 00:44:54.080
Some individuals activate it
when they have both cooperated.

00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:56.520
And there's a big
gender difference

00:44:56.520 --> 00:44:57.630
as to which circumstance.

00:44:57.630 --> 00:44:58.470
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:58.470 --> 00:45:01.107
So you just guess which
one is going on there.

00:45:01.107 --> 00:45:02.690
We're going to see
a number of studies

00:45:02.690 --> 00:45:05.070
like that coming down the line.

00:45:05.070 --> 00:45:06.870
So the question
becomes, how do you

00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:10.010
optimize prisoner dilemma play?

00:45:10.010 --> 00:45:11.970
And what emerged
at that time was

00:45:11.970 --> 00:45:15.210
the notion of all sorts of
theoretical models and stuff.

00:45:15.210 --> 00:45:18.240
And then in the 1970s,
there was an economist

00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:21.240
at University of Michigan
named Robert Axelrod who

00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:23.760
revolutionized the entire field.

00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:27.600
What he did was he took
some paleolithic computer

00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:29.980
and programmed in how the
prisoner's dilemma would

00:45:29.980 --> 00:45:31.010
be played.

00:45:31.010 --> 00:45:34.760
And he could program in as
if there were two players.

00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:39.130
And he could program in what
each one's strategy would be.

00:45:39.130 --> 00:45:42.900
And what he then did was, he
wrote to all of his buddies

00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:46.580
and all of his mathematician
friends and prize fighters

00:45:46.580 --> 00:45:50.910
and theologians and serial
murderers and Nobel Peace Prize

00:45:50.910 --> 00:45:52.490
winners, and in
each case, explained

00:45:52.490 --> 00:45:55.970
what was up and saying,
what strategy would you use

00:45:55.970 --> 00:45:58.020
in a prisoner's dilemma game?

00:45:58.020 --> 00:46:00.010
And he gets them all
back, and he programs

00:46:00.010 --> 00:46:01.380
all these different versions.

00:46:01.380 --> 00:46:04.200
And he runs a round
robin tournament.

00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:07.320
Every strategy is paired
against every other strategy

00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:08.430
at one point or other.

00:46:08.430 --> 00:46:10.470
And you look at
what the payoff is.

00:46:10.470 --> 00:46:14.400
You ask, which is the
most optimal strategy.

00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:18.000
And out of it,
shockingly to everyone--

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:21.590
because this was a computer
teaching us optimizing

00:46:21.590 --> 00:46:25.540
human behavior-- out of it
came one simple strategy that

00:46:25.540 --> 00:46:27.320
always out-competed the others.

00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:29.720
This is people sitting
there, probabilistic ones

00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:33.880
as to when to cooperate, and
lunar cycles as to what to do.

00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:38.980
The one that always won
is now called tit for tat.

00:46:38.980 --> 00:46:42.120
You start off cooperating
in the very first round

00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:43.300
with the individual.

00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:45.670
You cooperate.

00:46:45.670 --> 00:46:49.170
If the individual has cooperated
with you in that round,

00:46:49.170 --> 00:46:51.300
you cooperate in the next round.

00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:53.410
And you cooperate,
cooperate, as long

00:46:53.410 --> 00:46:55.120
as the other
individual cooperates.

00:46:55.120 --> 00:46:58.000
But as soon as there is a round
where the individual cheats

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:02.160
against you, you cheat
against them the next time.

00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:04.600
If they cheated at
you that time also,

00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:06.240
you cheat against
them the next time.

00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:08.590
If they go back to
cooperating, you

00:47:08.590 --> 00:47:11.530
go back to cooperating
the next time.

00:47:11.530 --> 00:47:13.540
You have this tit
for tat strategy.

00:47:13.540 --> 00:47:16.210
In the absence of somebody
stabbing you in the back,

00:47:16.210 --> 00:47:18.020
you will always cooperate.

00:47:18.020 --> 00:47:20.650
And what they found
was, run these hundreds

00:47:20.650 --> 00:47:24.040
of thousands of versions of
these round robin tournaments,

00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:27.240
and tit for tat was the
one that was most optimal,

00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:29.880
to begin to use a
word that is not just

00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:31.320
going to be a metaphor.

00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:34.330
Tit for tat always drove
the other strategies

00:47:34.330 --> 00:47:36.780
into extinction.

00:47:36.780 --> 00:47:40.770
And what you wound up seeing
is this optimized strategy.

00:47:40.770 --> 00:47:44.160
And it was very clear why
tit for tat worked so well.

00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:46.320
Number one, it was nice.

00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:48.170
You start off cooperating.

00:47:48.170 --> 00:47:52.590
Number two, it retaliates if
you do something crummy to it.

00:47:52.590 --> 00:47:55.440
Number three, it is forgiving.

00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:57.370
If you go back to cooperating.

00:47:57.370 --> 00:48:00.310
Number four, it's
clear cut in its play.

00:48:00.310 --> 00:48:02.570
It's not some
probabilistic thing.

00:48:02.570 --> 00:48:05.400
What you get, then,
with tit for tat is,

00:48:05.400 --> 00:48:08.270
suppose you're playing three
rounds with another individual.

00:48:08.270 --> 00:48:09.930
You both cooperate
the first one,

00:48:09.930 --> 00:48:11.430
you both cooperate the next one.

00:48:11.430 --> 00:48:13.030
You're playing tit
for tat strategy,

00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:14.250
so you cooperate on this one.

00:48:14.250 --> 00:48:17.100
And they stab you in the back,
and you can't get back at them,

00:48:17.100 --> 00:48:18.870
because this is the last round.

00:48:18.870 --> 00:48:21.610
What you'll see is, under
lots of circumstances,

00:48:21.610 --> 00:48:24.470
tit for tat is disadvantageous.

00:48:24.470 --> 00:48:27.660
But what the soundbite is
about it is, tit for tat

00:48:27.660 --> 00:48:30.800
may lose the battles,
but it wins all the wars.

00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:34.520
This pattern of being nice,
but being retaliatory, being

00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:37.070
forgiving, and being
clear in the rules,

00:48:37.070 --> 00:48:41.890
drives all the other
strategies into extinction.

00:48:41.890 --> 00:48:44.400
OK, at this point my
alarm just went off,

00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:46.370
which was to remind
me to ask somebody

00:48:46.370 --> 00:48:51.800
who is wearing a life vest-- is
somebody wearing a life vest?

00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:53.420
[INAUDIBLE]

00:48:53.420 --> 00:48:54.760
Over there.

00:48:54.760 --> 00:48:56.468
Where are you?

00:48:56.468 --> 00:48:57.780
She just left.

00:48:57.780 --> 00:48:58.822
She left.

00:48:58.822 --> 00:48:59.780
Isn't that interesting?

00:48:59.780 --> 00:49:02.340
Somebody put me up to
having to ask this person,

00:49:02.340 --> 00:49:03.940
why are you wearing a life vest?

00:49:03.940 --> 00:49:05.830
And apparently the
answer she would give

00:49:05.830 --> 00:49:09.510
was going to free all sorts of
captives in some rebel group

00:49:09.510 --> 00:49:11.051
in Colombia.

00:49:11.051 --> 00:49:12.310
And she fled.

00:49:12.310 --> 00:49:14.014
OK, what that does is--

00:49:14.014 --> 00:49:16.070
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:16.070 --> 00:49:18.340
I don't know what that says
about reciprocal altruism.

00:49:18.340 --> 00:49:21.760
But what that says also
is, after I do a summary,

00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:22.546
don't make a move.

00:49:22.546 --> 00:49:23.920
We will have a
five minute break.

00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:25.570
So what do we have
at this point,

00:49:25.570 --> 00:49:29.180
we have the first building
block of optimizing

00:49:29.180 --> 00:49:32.370
the evolution of behavior,
like optimizing giraffe hearts.

00:49:32.370 --> 00:49:35.710
First piece, you don't behave
for the good of the species.

00:49:35.710 --> 00:49:38.100
Individual selection,
passing on as many copies

00:49:38.100 --> 00:49:39.790
of your own genes as possible.

00:49:39.790 --> 00:49:43.090
Sometimes a chicken is an egg's
way of making another egg,

00:49:43.090 --> 00:49:44.510
he says triumphantly.

00:49:44.510 --> 00:49:47.180
Building block number
two, kin selection.

00:49:47.180 --> 00:49:50.380
Some of the time, the best way
to pass on copies of your genes

00:49:50.380 --> 00:49:52.780
is by way of helping relatives.

00:49:52.780 --> 00:49:55.610
Kin selection, with the
mathematical fierceness

00:49:55.610 --> 00:49:57.940
of degree of
relatedness driving it.

00:49:57.940 --> 00:50:01.050
Piece three, sometimes
what's most advantageous

00:50:01.050 --> 00:50:03.650
is to cooperate, even
with non-relatives,

00:50:03.650 --> 00:50:06.580
but with the rules of
it has to be reciprocal

00:50:06.580 --> 00:50:08.470
and you have to
cheat when possible.

00:50:08.470 --> 00:50:10.400
You have to be on
guard against cheaters.

00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:13.640
And as we've just seen, game
theory, prisoner's dilemma,

00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:17.590
beginning to formalize
optimal strategies for that.

00:50:17.590 --> 00:50:20.280
OK, let's take a
five minute break.

00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:23.110
But promise you will
come back if you go out,

00:50:23.110 --> 00:50:25.630
and everyone won't wander off.

00:50:25.630 --> 00:50:31.085
Altruism [INAUDIBLE] game
theory as being a form or way

00:50:31.085 --> 00:50:34.690
to maximize that behavior
in a very artificial realm,

00:50:34.690 --> 00:50:35.910
but stay tuned.

00:50:35.910 --> 00:50:38.300
Prisoner's dilemma
as the building block

00:50:38.300 --> 00:50:40.570
of how to do this amid
lots of other types

00:50:40.570 --> 00:50:41.760
of games that are used.

00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:44.200
But prisoner's dilemma
is the most basic one.

00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:47.850
And that round robin tournament,
that computer simulation,

00:50:47.850 --> 00:50:50.800
Axelrod asking all his
buddies to tell him

00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:53.760
what strategy would you use,
run them against each other,

00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:55.450
and out comes tit for tat.

00:50:55.450 --> 00:51:00.230
Tit for tat drives all the
others into extinction.

00:51:00.230 --> 00:51:02.260
However, there is
a vulnerability

00:51:02.260 --> 00:51:19.720
in tit for tat,
which is-- OK, so.

00:51:19.720 --> 00:51:23.110
We have the technical way of
showing prisoner's dilemma

00:51:23.110 --> 00:51:23.830
play.

00:51:23.830 --> 00:51:27.340
And first round, both
individuals are cooperating.

00:51:27.340 --> 00:51:30.150
Second round, both
individuals are cooperating.

00:51:30.150 --> 00:51:33.290
Third round, this one
cheats-- those are fangs.

00:51:33.290 --> 00:51:35.410
This one cheats and
this one cooperates.

00:51:35.410 --> 00:51:40.200
So the next round, this
one now cheats and this one

00:51:40.200 --> 00:51:42.580
goes back to cooperating,
and we've just

00:51:42.580 --> 00:51:46.070
gotten through a scary thing
that tit for tat solves,

00:51:46.070 --> 00:51:47.510
and it's great.

00:51:47.510 --> 00:51:48.610
Wonderful.

00:51:48.610 --> 00:51:52.660
What if, though, your
system is not 100% perfect.

00:51:52.660 --> 00:51:54.570
What if there's
a the possibility

00:51:54.570 --> 00:51:59.430
of a mistake being made, of
sending the wrong signal.

00:51:59.430 --> 00:52:03.410
What if there's the possibility
of noise in the communication

00:52:03.410 --> 00:52:04.060
system.

00:52:04.060 --> 00:52:06.310
And at some point,
an individual who

00:52:06.310 --> 00:52:09.260
does a cooperative
behavior, thanks to a glitch

00:52:09.260 --> 00:52:14.500
in the system, it is read
as having been defection.

00:52:14.500 --> 00:52:16.950
So what happens as a result?

00:52:16.950 --> 00:52:21.070
This individual-- forget it.

00:52:21.070 --> 00:52:26.060
OK, what happens as a result.
The individual who cooperated,

00:52:26.060 --> 00:52:28.820
but somehow the message
got through as cheating,

00:52:28.820 --> 00:52:30.030
they don't know.

00:52:30.030 --> 00:52:33.150
Something got lost in the wires
between them in translation.

00:52:33.150 --> 00:52:35.550
The other individual
was saying whoa,

00:52:35.550 --> 00:52:37.590
that individual
cheated against me.

00:52:37.590 --> 00:52:39.460
I'm going to cheat
in the next round.

00:52:39.460 --> 00:52:41.920
So along comes the next
round, and that individual

00:52:41.920 --> 00:52:43.179
cheats against them.

00:52:43.179 --> 00:52:44.970
This one who's cooperating,
because they've

00:52:44.970 --> 00:52:46.146
been cooperating all along.

00:52:46.146 --> 00:52:47.520
They don't know
about this error.

00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:50.920
And they say whoa, that person
just cheated against me.

00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:52.697
I'm going to cheat
in the next round.

00:52:52.697 --> 00:52:54.030
So they cheat in the next round.

00:52:54.030 --> 00:52:56.870
This one says whoa, they
just cheated another time,

00:52:56.870 --> 00:52:58.220
again and again and again.

00:52:58.220 --> 00:53:02.520
And what you get is a seesaw
pattern for the rest of time.

00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:05.870
You've just wiped out
50% of the cooperation.

00:53:05.870 --> 00:53:08.990
And what you've got is
tit for tat strategies

00:53:08.990 --> 00:53:11.800
are vulnerable to signal error.

00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:14.080
That's something that soon
came out in these studies

00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:15.680
of Axelrod's.

00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:18.940
When I was a kid, there was
like one of these thriller

00:53:18.940 --> 00:53:22.930
books I remember reading where
there's a glitch in the system.

00:53:22.930 --> 00:53:25.870
And at the time, the
mean scary Soviet Union

00:53:25.870 --> 00:53:29.620
launched a missile that--
no, it was the United States.

00:53:29.620 --> 00:53:31.420
The United States,
by accident, launched

00:53:31.420 --> 00:53:34.850
a missile, a nuclear weapon,
where they didn't mean to.

00:53:34.850 --> 00:53:39.050
Some cockroach chewed through
a wire some place or other.

00:53:39.050 --> 00:53:43.630
And the missile went off, and
wound up destroying Moscow.

00:53:43.630 --> 00:53:45.810
And oh my god, we had
a cooperative system

00:53:45.810 --> 00:53:49.430
of mutually restraint of
aggression, all of that.

00:53:49.430 --> 00:53:52.670
And thanks to a signal
error, a cheating signal

00:53:52.670 --> 00:53:54.250
was accidentally sent off.

00:53:54.250 --> 00:53:55.820
And how did the book end?

00:53:55.820 --> 00:53:57.290
A tit for tat response.

00:53:57.290 --> 00:54:00.960
In order to avoid
thermonuclear wasteland,

00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:04.990
the Soviet Union was
allowed to destroy New York.

00:54:04.990 --> 00:54:07.790
All right, so that
shows exactly how

00:54:07.790 --> 00:54:10.630
you could then get into
a see-sawing thing,

00:54:10.630 --> 00:54:14.370
simply by way of if the
system has any vulnerability

00:54:14.370 --> 00:54:15.610
to signal error.

00:54:15.610 --> 00:54:18.270
So it soon became clear,
as soon as Axelrod

00:54:18.270 --> 00:54:21.400
began to introduce the
possibility of signal errors,

00:54:21.400 --> 00:54:25.680
that tit for tat didn't work as
well as another strategy, one

00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:27.950
that quickly came
to the forefront.

00:54:27.950 --> 00:54:33.580
And that one-- for
some strange reason,

00:54:33.580 --> 00:54:35.940
that's the way it's shown.

00:54:35.940 --> 00:54:40.320
That one was called
forgiving tit for tat.

00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:42.570
What happens with
forgiving tit for tat?

00:54:42.570 --> 00:54:45.244
The usual rule, like tit
for tat, if you cooperate,

00:54:45.244 --> 00:54:46.910
if they cooperate,
you always cooperate.

00:54:46.910 --> 00:54:50.130
If they cheat against you, you
punish them in the next round.

00:54:50.130 --> 00:54:52.020
Exactly the same
thing as tit for tat,

00:54:52.020 --> 00:54:55.450
but oh no, what if there's
a signal error in the system

00:54:55.450 --> 00:54:58.590
and you've gotten caught in
one of these horrible seesawing

00:54:58.590 --> 00:54:59.170
things.

00:54:59.170 --> 00:55:02.100
What forgiving tit
for tat does is,

00:55:02.100 --> 00:55:04.350
we'll have a rule, for
example, that if we

00:55:04.350 --> 00:55:07.780
see saw like this
five times in a row,

00:55:07.780 --> 00:55:10.330
I will forego cheating
the next time.

00:55:10.330 --> 00:55:12.010
And instead, I'll cooperate.

00:55:12.010 --> 00:55:14.610
And that will get
things back on track.

00:55:14.610 --> 00:55:18.780
I am willing to be
forgiving in one round

00:55:18.780 --> 00:55:21.600
in order to
re-establish cooperation

00:55:21.600 --> 00:55:23.940
after the signal error came in.

00:55:23.940 --> 00:55:26.080
And that one-- as
soon as you introduce

00:55:26.080 --> 00:55:29.060
the possibility of signal
error, that one out-competes

00:55:29.060 --> 00:55:30.530
tit for tat.

00:55:30.530 --> 00:55:32.650
Because it makes perfect sense.

00:55:32.650 --> 00:55:36.050
It's a great way of
solving that problem.

00:55:36.050 --> 00:55:38.280
So that was terrific.

00:55:38.280 --> 00:55:40.220
Tit for tat with the
ability to forgive,

00:55:40.220 --> 00:55:44.096
and what you would then see is
variability, how many of these

00:55:44.096 --> 00:55:46.540
do you need to go through
before you forgive,

00:55:46.540 --> 00:55:49.450
what's the optimal number
of see-sawings, all of that.

00:55:49.450 --> 00:55:53.200
So a whole world of optimizing
how soon you're forgiving.

00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:56.270
Nonetheless, the general
theme being forgiving tit

00:55:56.270 --> 00:55:59.890
for tat out-competes tit for tat
when you can have signal error.

00:55:59.890 --> 00:56:02.170
But there is a vulnerability.

00:56:02.170 --> 00:56:04.960
There is a vulnerability
here to this one, which

00:56:04.960 --> 00:56:07.270
is, you could be exploited.

00:56:07.270 --> 00:56:09.970
If you're playing against,
for example, a tit for tatter,

00:56:09.970 --> 00:56:12.360
or all sorts of other
strategies, where

00:56:12.360 --> 00:56:16.570
they don't have forgiving
strings of defection

00:56:16.570 --> 00:56:18.517
and you do, what's
going to happen

00:56:18.517 --> 00:56:20.600
is you're going to keep
going back to cooperating,

00:56:20.600 --> 00:56:23.020
they're going to keep
stabbing you in your back.

00:56:23.020 --> 00:56:27.500
Forgiving tit for tat is
vulnerable to exploitation

00:56:27.500 --> 00:56:30.070
playing against
individual players that

00:56:30.070 --> 00:56:32.790
don't have forgiveness in them.

00:56:32.790 --> 00:56:38.260
So what soon became apparent was
an even better strategy, which

00:56:38.260 --> 00:56:48.880
is you start off with
a tit for tat strategy.

00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:51.520
Which is, you are
punitive, you are

00:56:51.520 --> 00:56:55.100
retaliatory amid being
forgiving, clear and nice

00:56:55.100 --> 00:56:55.820
initially.

00:56:55.820 --> 00:56:59.020
You are willing to punish, and
you cannot be exploited in this

00:56:59.020 --> 00:57:00.290
way.

00:57:00.290 --> 00:57:04.170
If and only if you have gone
whatever number of rounds

00:57:04.170 --> 00:57:07.470
without the other individual
ever cheating on you, if you've

00:57:07.470 --> 00:57:09.760
gone long enough
without that happening,

00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:12.380
you switch over to
forgiving tit for tat.

00:57:12.380 --> 00:57:13.760
What is that?

00:57:13.760 --> 00:57:16.050
That's deciding
you trust somebody.

00:57:16.050 --> 00:57:18.140
You've had enough
interactions with them

00:57:18.140 --> 00:57:20.060
that you are willing
to trust them.

00:57:20.060 --> 00:57:24.890
This is the transition from
pure rational optimizing

00:57:24.890 --> 00:57:28.990
to switching over, forgiveness
coming in there protects you

00:57:28.990 --> 00:57:30.280
from signal error.

00:57:30.280 --> 00:57:34.190
And of course, now, a whole
world of how many rounds do you

00:57:34.190 --> 00:57:36.700
need to do this before
you switch that as to what

00:57:36.700 --> 00:57:38.350
the optimal deal with that is.

00:57:38.350 --> 00:57:41.380
But again, this is a
way of transitioning

00:57:41.380 --> 00:57:44.280
to solve the problem
of signal error,

00:57:44.280 --> 00:57:48.590
but forgiving too readily
and being taken advantage of.

00:57:48.590 --> 00:57:53.390
Soon, another strategy appeared,
which was called Pavlov.

00:57:53.390 --> 00:57:56.390
And those of you who
know Pavlovian psychology

00:57:56.390 --> 00:57:59.340
will see that this, in fact,
has nothing whatsoever to do

00:57:59.340 --> 00:58:02.500
with Pavlovian psychology, and
I don't know why they did that.

00:58:02.500 --> 00:58:04.050
But they thought it
was kind of cool.

00:58:04.050 --> 00:58:07.870
But the rule was
remember, if you

00:58:07.870 --> 00:58:10.790
stab the other guy in the back,
you get a bunch of points.

00:58:10.790 --> 00:58:13.870
If you both cooperate, you
get points, not as many.

00:58:13.870 --> 00:58:16.870
If you both cheat,
you lose some points.

00:58:16.870 --> 00:58:20.130
If you're taken advantage
of, you lose a lot of points.

00:58:20.130 --> 00:58:23.260
So two outcomes you gain,
two outcomes you lose.

00:58:23.260 --> 00:58:27.130
In Pavlov, the simple rule
is when I do something,

00:58:27.130 --> 00:58:30.660
if I get points, if I get
some degree of reward,

00:58:30.660 --> 00:58:33.010
I do it again the next time.

00:58:33.010 --> 00:58:36.350
If I get rewarded in either of
the first two types of payoffs,

00:58:36.350 --> 00:58:39.390
I do the same thing again.

00:58:39.390 --> 00:58:44.080
And the other part, of course,
is, if I play my strategy

00:58:44.080 --> 00:58:48.100
and I lose one of the
two bottom outcomes,

00:58:48.100 --> 00:58:51.310
I switch to the other
strategy the next time.

00:58:51.310 --> 00:58:55.000
And what you see is that
can establish very good tit

00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:55.780
for tat stuff.

00:58:55.780 --> 00:58:58.290
But if you sit and
spend hours tonight

00:58:58.290 --> 00:59:01.000
with a long roll of
toilet paper and playing

00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:02.590
out all the rounds
of it, you will

00:59:02.590 --> 00:59:06.200
see what Pavlov allows
you to do is exploit

00:59:06.200 --> 00:59:08.250
somebody else who is forgiving.

00:59:08.250 --> 00:59:10.930
So Pavlov goes along
just fine with this.

00:59:10.930 --> 00:59:14.580
And as long as Pavlov continues,
whenever they switch over

00:59:14.580 --> 00:59:16.940
to a forgiving tit
for tat, Pavlov

00:59:16.940 --> 00:59:19.770
will out-compete them,
because Pavlov exploits.

00:59:22.340 --> 00:59:26.330
What then emerged was just
zillions of people studying

00:59:26.330 --> 00:59:28.220
all sorts of games like this.

00:59:28.220 --> 00:59:32.050
There's other ones, ultimatum
game, there's a trust game.

00:59:32.050 --> 00:59:34.520
It's the same notion
of business there,

00:59:34.520 --> 00:59:37.460
which is you choose to
cooperate, you choose to cheat,

00:59:37.460 --> 00:59:39.240
what's the optimal outcome.

00:59:39.240 --> 00:59:42.450
There are mathematically optimal
outcomes that you can use,

00:59:42.450 --> 00:59:44.670
and you run all of it
against the computer,

00:59:44.670 --> 00:59:48.120
and you get the optimization
popping out the other end.

00:59:48.120 --> 00:59:49.130
Wonderful.

00:59:49.130 --> 00:59:52.210
So there's Axelrod and
his buddies using terms

00:59:52.210 --> 00:59:54.360
like oh, this
strategy will drive

00:59:54.360 --> 00:59:56.400
the other one into extinction.

00:59:56.400 --> 01:00:00.020
Or this strategy works,
but if you program in

01:00:00.020 --> 01:00:02.430
that every now and then
there could be a glitch,

01:00:02.430 --> 01:00:04.770
there can be a mutation,
this will be-- they're

01:00:04.770 --> 01:00:09.130
using all this biology jargon,
obviously metaphorically.

01:00:09.130 --> 01:00:11.630
But right around this
point, the biologists

01:00:11.630 --> 01:00:14.000
look at this, who are
just beginning to think

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.990
about the social biology stuff.

01:00:15.990 --> 01:00:19.530
Formal patterns of
optimizing behavior.

01:00:19.530 --> 01:00:23.290
And they say whoa, does
this apply to the behavior

01:00:23.290 --> 01:00:25.060
of real organisms?

01:00:25.060 --> 01:00:28.810
Because at this point, it's just
economists and computer types

01:00:28.810 --> 01:00:31.410
and diplomats learning
when to optimize,

01:00:31.410 --> 01:00:32.560
all that sort of thing.

01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:36.120
Around the time there
was a paper published,

01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:37.380
somewhat before that.

01:00:37.380 --> 01:00:39.836
This is a name nobody
is going to know,

01:00:39.836 --> 01:00:42.720
lost in history, a guy
named Daniel Ellsberg.

01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:46.800
Daniel Ellsberg became
very famous around 1970,

01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:48.840
by he was working
in the Pentagon

01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:52.210
and he stole thousands
of pages of secret files

01:00:52.210 --> 01:00:54.370
there, and gave it
to the New York Times

01:00:54.370 --> 01:00:57.680
showing how utterly
corrupt everything that

01:00:57.680 --> 01:01:00.730
went on behind the scenes was
in getting us into Vietnam.

01:01:00.730 --> 01:01:02.880
Major blowout, all of that.

01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:06.430
He had spent the early part of
his career perfectly happily

01:01:06.430 --> 01:01:10.930
working in the Pentagon for the
military as a game theorist.

01:01:10.930 --> 01:01:13.780
As a game theorist coming
up with optimal patterns.

01:01:13.780 --> 01:01:17.230
And he wrote one paper
called "The Optimal

01:01:17.230 --> 01:01:20.270
Benefits of Perceived Madness".

01:01:20.270 --> 01:01:22.750
What times do you
want your opponent

01:01:22.750 --> 01:01:25.640
to think you are
absolutely out of your mind

01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:27.960
and going to do all
sorts of crazy stuff,

01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:29.610
and where they
wind up cooperating

01:01:29.610 --> 01:01:31.300
to keep you from doing that.

01:01:31.300 --> 01:01:33.730
The advantages of
madness, what's that.

01:01:33.730 --> 01:01:37.320
That's systems where things like
mutually assured destruction

01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:40.630
doesn't work, because you
are willing to set it off.

01:01:40.630 --> 01:01:42.310
The advantages of madness.

01:01:42.310 --> 01:01:45.990
This whole world of people
working on it, mathematicians

01:01:45.990 --> 01:01:47.610
and war strategists.

01:01:47.610 --> 01:01:52.050
And there's the zoologists now
looking at this saying whoa,

01:01:52.050 --> 01:01:53.360
this is cool.

01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:56.280
I wonder if animals
behave that way.

01:01:56.280 --> 01:01:59.220
And that's when people, now
armed with their insights

01:01:59.220 --> 01:02:01.490
into prisoner's dilemma
and tit for tat,

01:02:01.490 --> 01:02:04.650
all this stuff, started to
go and study animals out

01:02:04.650 --> 01:02:08.010
in the wild and see, were
there any examples where

01:02:08.010 --> 01:02:09.480
this happened.

01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:10.440
Yes.

01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:12.860
In all sorts of
interesting realms.

01:02:12.860 --> 01:02:16.090
First example, vampire bats.

01:02:16.090 --> 01:02:18.970
Vampire bats, we are all
set up to be creeped out

01:02:18.970 --> 01:02:20.150
by vampire bats.

01:02:20.150 --> 01:02:23.230
But in actuality, when you
see a vampire bat drinking

01:02:23.230 --> 01:02:25.410
the blood of some
cow or something,

01:02:25.410 --> 01:02:29.740
you are watching a mommy
getting food for her babies.

01:02:29.740 --> 01:02:32.370
Because vampire bat
mothers are not actually

01:02:32.370 --> 01:02:33.890
drinking the blood.

01:02:33.890 --> 01:02:36.010
They're filling up
this throat sack thing,

01:02:36.010 --> 01:02:38.030
and they go back to the
nest and they disgorge

01:02:38.030 --> 01:02:39.780
the blood to feed their babies.

01:02:39.780 --> 01:02:42.570
She's just watching
out for her kids.

01:02:42.570 --> 01:02:45.950
It happens that vampire bats
have an interesting system

01:02:45.950 --> 01:02:49.230
of reciprocal altruism, which
is a whole bunch of females

01:02:49.230 --> 01:02:51.140
will share the same nest.

01:02:51.140 --> 01:02:53.660
Will have all their
kids in there mixed in.

01:02:53.660 --> 01:02:55.710
And these are not
necessarily related,

01:02:55.710 --> 01:02:58.290
so we've just left the
world of kin selection.

01:02:58.290 --> 01:03:00.260
They're not necessarily
related, but they have

01:03:00.260 --> 01:03:02.070
reciprocal altruists system.

01:03:02.070 --> 01:03:05.830
Each female comes in,
disgorges the blood,

01:03:05.830 --> 01:03:07.800
and feeds everybody's babies.

01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:09.450
And they all feed
each other's babies,

01:03:09.450 --> 01:03:10.640
and everything is terrific.

01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:13.810
And they have this blood
vampire commune going there.

01:03:13.810 --> 01:03:17.740
And they've reached a nice
state of stable cooperation.

01:03:17.740 --> 01:03:21.280
Now, make the bats think
that one of the females

01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:23.600
is cheating on them.

01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:26.890
Out comes that female flying off
to find some blood, and instead

01:03:26.890 --> 01:03:29.230
you net her and
get a hold of her,

01:03:29.230 --> 01:03:31.700
and take some
syringe full of air

01:03:31.700 --> 01:03:33.870
and pump up the throat
sack so the throat

01:03:33.870 --> 01:03:36.051
sack is really
full and distended,

01:03:36.051 --> 01:03:37.300
but there's no blood in there.

01:03:37.300 --> 01:03:38.880
You've just pumped
air into there.

01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:40.549
And stick her back
into the nest there.

01:03:40.549 --> 01:03:42.090
And she's just
sitting there happily,

01:03:42.090 --> 01:03:43.464
and the other
females are sitting

01:03:43.464 --> 01:03:46.800
saying look at her, look at
how much blood she's got there.

01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:49.890
I can't believe it, because
she's not feeding our kids.

01:03:49.890 --> 01:03:51.280
She's cheating on us.

01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:53.450
And the next time
they go out to feed,

01:03:53.450 --> 01:03:56.600
the other females
don't feed her kids.

01:03:56.600 --> 01:03:58.310
A tit for tat.

01:03:58.310 --> 01:04:01.150
What you saw here
is an exact example

01:04:01.150 --> 01:04:02.840
of introducing signal error.

01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:05.640
Signal error, in this case,
being some grad student

01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:08.450
pumping up the throat
of some vampire bat

01:04:08.450 --> 01:04:12.380
and showing that they're using
a version of a tit for tat

01:04:12.380 --> 01:04:13.490
strategy.

01:04:13.490 --> 01:04:14.990
Totally amazing.

01:04:14.990 --> 01:04:17.110
People were blown away by this.

01:04:17.110 --> 01:04:19.930
Another example, fish.

01:04:19.930 --> 01:04:23.620
Stickleback fish who, in the
world of animals-- you know,

01:04:23.620 --> 01:04:26.060
bats are probably not some of
the brightest folks around.

01:04:26.060 --> 01:04:29.490
But I don't think sticklebacks
are within light years of them.

01:04:29.490 --> 01:04:32.650
But stickleback fish can
do a tit for tat strategy.

01:04:32.650 --> 01:04:33.550
Here's what you do.

01:04:33.550 --> 01:04:38.440
You have a stickleback
fish in your fish tank,

01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:41.650
and you make the fish
believe that he's

01:04:41.650 --> 01:04:44.240
being attacked by another fish.

01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:44.900
What do you do?

01:04:44.900 --> 01:04:47.900
You put a mirror up against
the edge of the tank there.

01:04:47.900 --> 01:04:49.819
So within a very short
time-- I told you

01:04:49.819 --> 01:04:50.860
they were not that smart.

01:04:50.860 --> 01:04:52.700
So within a very
short time, he's

01:04:52.700 --> 01:04:55.480
lunging forward at
this mirrored thing

01:04:55.480 --> 01:04:58.110
and maintaining his
territory against this guy

01:04:58.110 --> 01:04:59.410
and barely holding on.

01:04:59.410 --> 01:05:02.530
And that other guy is
just-- he doesn't get tired.

01:05:02.530 --> 01:05:04.230
Thank god I don't get tired.

01:05:04.230 --> 01:05:05.810
And they're just going at it.

01:05:05.810 --> 01:05:10.300
And now make him think he
has a cooperative partner.

01:05:10.300 --> 01:05:14.150
Put in a second mirror
that's perpendicular here.

01:05:14.150 --> 01:05:17.460
In other words, he sees
his reflection there.

01:05:17.460 --> 01:05:19.710
And every time he
moves forward, the

01:05:19.710 --> 01:05:22.990
sees that one moving
forward, which is fortunate

01:05:22.990 --> 01:05:25.760
because he's also seeing another
fish coming from that way.

01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:27.635
And he's sitting there
saying, this is great.

01:05:27.635 --> 01:05:30.150
I don't know who this guy is,
but wow, what a team we are.

01:05:30.150 --> 01:05:30.892
[LAUGHTER]

01:05:30.892 --> 01:05:31.850
Doubles, this is great.

01:05:31.850 --> 01:05:33.880
He's in there and the thing
is, it's funny how those two

01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:35.060
guys are so synchronized.

01:05:35.060 --> 01:05:37.590
But whoa, we're holding
them off and we're doing it.

01:05:37.590 --> 01:05:41.180
Now make him think his
cooperating partner is,

01:05:41.180 --> 01:05:43.120
in fact, cheating on him.

01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:45.570
Take the mirror and
angle it back a little

01:05:45.570 --> 01:05:49.120
bit so the reflection
is set back some.

01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:52.430
And what he now sees is
the fish moving forward,

01:05:52.430 --> 01:05:54.560
but not all the way
up to the wall there.

01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:56.200
The fish is hanging back there.

01:05:56.200 --> 01:05:57.610
The fish is cheating.

01:05:57.610 --> 01:06:00.330
And this stickleback is sitting
there saying, in effect,

01:06:00.330 --> 01:06:02.067
that son of a bitch.

01:06:02.067 --> 01:06:03.650
I can't believe he's
doing that to me.

01:06:03.650 --> 01:06:04.983
We've worked together for years.

01:06:04.983 --> 01:06:07.710
I can't believe he's-- oh
he's pretending to go forward.

01:06:07.710 --> 01:06:09.750
But I see he's not
really doing that.

01:06:09.750 --> 01:06:12.540
Fortunately, that guy isn't
coming forward anymore, either.

01:06:12.540 --> 01:06:13.170
Phew.

01:06:13.170 --> 01:06:14.900
But I can't believe
the guy is cheating.

01:06:14.900 --> 01:06:18.420
And the next time you set up
this scenario, the next time

01:06:18.420 --> 01:06:21.320
there's a chance the
stickleback doesn't attack

01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:22.910
its own reflection there.

01:06:22.910 --> 01:06:26.300
It is tit for tatting
against this guy.

01:06:26.300 --> 01:06:29.110
So here we've managed to
set up one of these deals

01:06:29.110 --> 01:06:31.800
within one fish and
carrying it out forever.

01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:34.800
One fish, ultimately with
some very blistered lips.

01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:36.980
Tit for tat, once again.

01:06:36.980 --> 01:06:38.150
Another example.

01:06:38.150 --> 01:06:41.546
This is the most bizarre
one I can imagine, and leads

01:06:41.546 --> 01:06:43.170
to all sorts of
subjects that are going

01:06:43.170 --> 01:06:44.760
to come many lectures from now.

01:06:44.760 --> 01:06:48.440
But there are fish species
that will change sex.

01:06:48.440 --> 01:06:52.220
And they do it under all sorts
of strategic circumstances

01:06:52.220 --> 01:06:54.870
that suddenly begin to fit
into this realm of what

01:06:54.870 --> 01:06:56.210
we've been learning about.

01:06:56.210 --> 01:06:59.390
And you've got one of these
things called black hamlet

01:06:59.390 --> 01:06:59.940
fish.

01:06:59.940 --> 01:07:02.350
And they can change gender.

01:07:02.350 --> 01:07:04.280
So you'll have a
pair of them who

01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:06.520
hang out with each other
of opposite genders,

01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:07.799
and they take turns.

01:07:07.799 --> 01:07:08.840
They flip back and forth.

01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:11.110
For a while, this one's
female, and for a while,

01:07:11.110 --> 01:07:11.860
this one's female.

01:07:11.860 --> 01:07:13.750
And they go back and
forth, and that's great.

01:07:13.750 --> 01:07:15.770
But there's an
inequity there, which

01:07:15.770 --> 01:07:17.530
is that the price
of reproduction

01:07:17.530 --> 01:07:21.240
is greater for the
female than for the male.

01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:22.970
As is the case in
so many species,

01:07:22.970 --> 01:07:25.920
the female doing all
that egg and ovaduct

01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:28.570
and progesterone stuff,
or whatever it is.

01:07:28.570 --> 01:07:31.160
And the male's just got to
come up with some sperm there.

01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:34.250
Doing to reproduction
as a cooperating pair,

01:07:34.250 --> 01:07:35.660
they're not relatives.

01:07:35.660 --> 01:07:39.760
Reciprocal altruism, maximizing
each of their reproductions.

01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:42.200
Whoever's the female
in any given round

01:07:42.200 --> 01:07:44.510
is the one who's paying more.

01:07:44.510 --> 01:07:48.110
What you see are reciprocal
relationships there

01:07:48.110 --> 01:07:50.740
of the fish using tit for tat.

01:07:50.740 --> 01:07:54.300
If you get one fish that
begins to cheat and winds up

01:07:54.300 --> 01:07:56.350
being a male too
much of the time,

01:07:56.350 --> 01:07:58.950
the other fish stops
cooperating with them.

01:07:58.950 --> 01:08:00.780
Again, tit for tat stuff.

01:08:00.780 --> 01:08:04.180
So people were just blown out
of the water at this point,

01:08:04.180 --> 01:08:08.770
seeing whoa, forget rational
human economic thinking,

01:08:08.770 --> 01:08:09.370
all of that.

01:08:09.370 --> 01:08:13.180
You go out into the wild,
and bats and stickleback fish

01:08:13.180 --> 01:08:15.510
and gender switching
fish and all of that,

01:08:15.510 --> 01:08:18.270
they're following some of
the exact same strategies.

01:08:18.270 --> 01:08:20.279
Isn't nature amazing.

01:08:20.279 --> 01:08:21.729
No, nature isn't amazing.

01:08:21.729 --> 01:08:23.840
It's the exact same
logic as saying

01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:26.300
a giraffe has to
have a heart that's

01:08:26.300 --> 01:08:28.130
strong enough to
pump blood to the top

01:08:28.130 --> 01:08:29.540
of the head of a giraffe.

01:08:29.540 --> 01:08:31.250
Or else there
wouldn't be a giraffe.

01:08:31.250 --> 01:08:34.939
And when you look at this realm,
it's applying the same notion.

01:08:34.939 --> 01:08:39.319
This same sort of wind tunnel
of selective optimization

01:08:39.319 --> 01:08:42.050
for behavior-- in this
case, when to cheat,

01:08:42.050 --> 01:08:44.390
when to cooperate--
sculpts something

01:08:44.390 --> 01:08:47.330
that is as optimized
as a giraffe's heart

01:08:47.330 --> 01:08:48.810
being the right size.

01:08:48.810 --> 01:08:50.740
So this made perfect sense.

01:08:50.740 --> 01:08:52.130
Wonderful.

01:08:52.130 --> 01:08:54.740
But then people began to
look a little bit closer,

01:08:54.740 --> 01:08:58.330
and began to see the very
distressing real world

01:08:58.330 --> 01:08:59.700
beginning to creep in there.

01:08:59.700 --> 01:09:01.750
Which were exceptions.

01:09:01.750 --> 01:09:03.080
First exception.

01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:05.560
This was done by a guy named
Craig Packer, University

01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:09.029
of Minnesota, looking
at lions in East Africa.

01:09:09.029 --> 01:09:11.840
What you get is,
typically, prides

01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:15.550
are a whole bunch of relatives,
usually female, sisters,

01:09:15.550 --> 01:09:16.507
nieces, all of that.

01:09:16.507 --> 01:09:18.090
But you will sometimes
get prides that

01:09:18.090 --> 01:09:19.410
are not of close relatives.

01:09:19.410 --> 01:09:23.250
Nonetheless, they will get
reciprocal altruistic things

01:09:23.250 --> 01:09:24.290
going on.

01:09:24.290 --> 01:09:27.090
Lions, in this case,
having the same trick as

01:09:27.090 --> 01:09:28.840
was done on those
vervet monkeys.

01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:32.979
Researcher putting inside
the bush there a speaker,

01:09:32.979 --> 01:09:39.270
and playing the sound of like
400 menacing lions all at once.

01:09:39.270 --> 01:09:42.050
What you're supposed to do
is freak out at that point.

01:09:42.050 --> 01:09:44.569
And all of you need to very
carefully approach and see

01:09:44.569 --> 01:09:46.899
what's going on in that bush.

01:09:46.899 --> 01:09:49.399
So what would happen
in a reciprocal system,

01:09:49.399 --> 01:09:51.680
and everybody does this.

01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:53.700
Or if one time, one
of them cheats on you,

01:09:53.700 --> 01:09:55.680
you push that one
forward the next time.

01:09:55.680 --> 01:09:56.522
Or some such thing.

01:09:56.522 --> 01:09:57.730
That's what you would expect.

01:09:57.730 --> 01:09:59.510
But what he would
begin to notice

01:09:59.510 --> 01:10:03.680
is, in a bunch of these groups,
there'd be one scaredy cat

01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:07.770
lion, one who habitually
stayed behind the others

01:10:07.770 --> 01:10:10.190
and who wasn't punished for it.

01:10:10.190 --> 01:10:12.460
So this produced
this first puzzle

01:10:12.460 --> 01:10:15.910
that oh, sometimes animals
aren't optimizing tit for tat.

01:10:15.910 --> 01:10:19.670
Sometimes animals haven't read
Robert Axelrod's landmark 1972

01:10:19.670 --> 01:10:21.230
paper, that sort of thing.

01:10:21.230 --> 01:10:24.830
And what you suddenly
have is the real world.

01:10:24.830 --> 01:10:27.320
What could be
possible explanations?

01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:31.010
One thing being, maybe they're
not really paying attention.

01:10:31.010 --> 01:10:32.740
Maybe they're not
quite that smart.

01:10:32.740 --> 01:10:35.180
Wait, bacteria are doing
versions of tit for tat.

01:10:35.180 --> 01:10:36.480
What else could be going on?

01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:39.800
Oh, lions interact
in other realms.

01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:44.150
Maybe this individual is
doing very reciprocal stuff,

01:10:44.150 --> 01:10:47.980
forgiving overly altruistic
stuff in some other realm

01:10:47.980 --> 01:10:48.990
of behavior.

01:10:48.990 --> 01:10:52.300
Maybe this lion eats
less of the meat

01:10:52.300 --> 01:10:55.160
and backs off earlier,
or something like that.

01:10:55.160 --> 01:10:59.740
Maybe there's another game
going on simultaneously.

01:10:59.740 --> 01:11:01.880
And this is introducing
the real world

01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:04.670
in which it is not
just two individuals

01:11:04.670 --> 01:11:08.270
sitting there playing prisoner's
dilemma and optimizing.

01:11:08.270 --> 01:11:11.085
You suddenly begin to get
real world complexities coming

01:11:11.085 --> 01:11:11.790
in there.

01:11:11.790 --> 01:11:13.570
And by the time we
get to the lectures,

01:11:13.570 --> 01:11:16.700
way down the line, on
aggression and cooperation,

01:11:16.700 --> 01:11:19.870
what you'll see is things
get really complicated

01:11:19.870 --> 01:11:23.170
when you have individuals
playing games simultaneously.

01:11:23.170 --> 01:11:25.980
The rules that you apply
to one psychologically

01:11:25.980 --> 01:11:28.270
begin to dribble
into the other one.

01:11:28.270 --> 01:11:30.000
All sorts of things like that.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:31.590
It will get very complicated.

01:11:31.590 --> 01:11:34.590
So a first hint there
that, in fact, everything

01:11:34.590 --> 01:11:36.620
doesn't work perfectly
along those lines.

01:11:36.620 --> 01:11:38.460
Here's another version.

01:11:38.460 --> 01:11:41.510
Here's one of the truly
weird species out there,

01:11:41.510 --> 01:11:44.950
something called
the naked mole rat.

01:11:44.950 --> 01:11:47.040
If you ever have
nothing to do and you've

01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:51.190
got Google Image up there, go
spend the evening looking up

01:11:51.190 --> 01:11:53.430
close up pictures
of naked mole rats.

01:11:53.430 --> 01:11:56.140
These are the weirdest
things out there.

01:11:56.140 --> 01:11:58.810
They are the closest
things among the mammals

01:11:58.810 --> 01:12:02.630
to social insects, in terms
of how their colonies work.

01:12:02.630 --> 01:12:04.700
They're totally
bizarre, all of that.

01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:07.650
But they live in these
big, cooperative colonies

01:12:07.650 --> 01:12:10.120
that are predominately
underground in Africa.

01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:13.440
And they were discovered, I
think, only in the 1970s or so.

01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:16.030
And for a while when
zoologists got together,

01:12:16.030 --> 01:12:18.220
if you were a naked
mole rat person,

01:12:18.220 --> 01:12:19.970
you were just the
coolest around.

01:12:19.970 --> 01:12:22.050
And everybody else
would feel intimidated,

01:12:22.050 --> 01:12:24.620
because you were working on
the best species out there.

01:12:24.620 --> 01:12:27.270
And you would see these
big cooperative colonies,

01:12:27.270 --> 01:12:30.490
soon shown to not
necessarily be of relatives.

01:12:30.490 --> 01:12:33.620
And reciprocity and all
those sorts of rules.

01:12:33.620 --> 01:12:35.830
But people soon
began to recognize

01:12:35.830 --> 01:12:39.350
there would be one or two
animals in each colony that

01:12:39.350 --> 01:12:41.070
weren't doing any work.

01:12:41.070 --> 01:12:44.800
Work digging out
tunnels, bookkeeping,

01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:47.070
I don't know what naked mole
rats do in terms of work.

01:12:47.070 --> 01:12:49.080
But there would be a
few individuals who

01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:50.550
would just be sitting around.

01:12:50.550 --> 01:12:53.200
And they were these big
old naked mole rats.

01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:54.950
They were much bigger
than the other ones,

01:12:54.950 --> 01:12:57.280
and they were scarfing
up food left and right.

01:12:57.280 --> 01:13:00.180
There goes Robert
Axelrod down the drain.

01:13:00.180 --> 01:13:01.640
There goes all
that optimization,

01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:03.860
because no one would be
punishing these guys.

01:13:03.860 --> 01:13:05.330
What's the deal?

01:13:05.330 --> 01:13:08.500
And it took enough watching
these animals long enough

01:13:08.500 --> 01:13:11.170
to see this notion
of oh, there's

01:13:11.170 --> 01:13:13.400
another game going
on in which they

01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:15.480
play a more important role.

01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:18.150
And it is sort of
dribbling across.

01:13:18.150 --> 01:13:22.230
When the rainy season comes,
these big naked mole rats

01:13:22.230 --> 01:13:25.780
go up and turn around and they
plug the entry to the tunnels

01:13:25.780 --> 01:13:26.280
then.

01:13:26.280 --> 01:13:27.600
[LAUGHTER]

01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:29.040
That's what they do.

01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:30.540
And suddenly,
these guys who have

01:13:30.540 --> 01:13:33.150
been sitting around doing
no work whatsoever all year

01:13:33.150 --> 01:13:36.610
and eating tons of stuff, they
suddenly have to now stick

01:13:36.610 --> 01:13:39.170
their rear ends out for
the coyotes to be around

01:13:39.170 --> 01:13:40.850
or whatever it is
that predates them.

01:13:40.850 --> 01:13:44.120
What we have is role
diversification.

01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:47.220
Real animals, real
organisms, are not just

01:13:47.220 --> 01:13:51.030
playing one formal prisoner's
dilemma game against each other

01:13:51.030 --> 01:13:52.870
at the same time.

01:13:52.870 --> 01:13:55.560
And by the time we, again,
get to the later lectures

01:13:55.560 --> 01:13:57.300
on aggression,
cooperation, all of that,

01:13:57.300 --> 01:14:00.820
we will not only see that things
get much more complicated when

01:14:00.820 --> 01:14:02.770
you're playing
simultaneous games,

01:14:02.770 --> 01:14:04.932
when you're playing a game
against one individual

01:14:04.932 --> 01:14:06.640
while you're playing
against another one,

01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:09.240
and then against
triangular circumstances.

01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:12.690
How play differs if you
know how many rounds

01:14:12.690 --> 01:14:14.910
you are playing against
the individual versus

01:14:14.910 --> 01:14:16.330
if you have no idea.

01:14:16.330 --> 01:14:18.560
How play differs
if, when you are

01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:20.530
about to play
against someone, you

01:14:20.530 --> 01:14:22.830
get to find out what
their behavior has

01:14:22.830 --> 01:14:25.660
been in the previous trials
with other individuals.

01:14:25.660 --> 01:14:29.200
In other words, if somebody
shows up with a reputation,

01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:31.940
we'll see this is a much
more complicated world

01:14:31.940 --> 01:14:33.370
of playing out these games.

01:14:33.370 --> 01:14:35.570
A much more realistic one.

01:14:35.570 --> 01:14:39.180
So we begin to see a first pass
at all this optimization stuff,

01:14:39.180 --> 01:14:40.710
and how great that all is.

01:14:40.710 --> 01:14:44.770
One final interesting addition
to this game theory world

01:14:44.770 --> 01:14:47.780
of thinking about behavior like
that, which came from a guy

01:14:47.780 --> 01:14:51.100
named James Holland,
who apparently-- might

01:14:51.100 --> 01:14:52.350
have a different first name.

01:14:52.350 --> 01:14:55.570
But Holland, apparently, as an
interesting piece in history,

01:14:55.570 --> 01:14:57.410
he's the person first
person to ever get

01:14:57.410 --> 01:14:59.670
a PhD in Computer Sciences.

01:14:59.670 --> 01:15:02.520
Which I think was in the late
50s, University of Michigan.

01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:05.980
Apparently, there are realms
of computer programmers

01:15:05.980 --> 01:15:07.400
who worship this guy.

01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:09.900
And he, like a lot of other
folks in that business,

01:15:09.900 --> 01:15:12.910
got interested in this
game theory evolution

01:15:12.910 --> 01:15:14.300
of optimal strategies.

01:15:14.300 --> 01:15:16.870
And he designed ways
of running all of this.

01:15:16.870 --> 01:15:18.910
And he introduced
a new ripple, which

01:15:18.910 --> 01:15:22.930
is the possibility of a
strategy suddenly changing.

01:15:22.930 --> 01:15:26.080
The possibility of a mutation.

01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:28.560
What he could then
study was mutations,

01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:31.290
how often they were
adaptive, how often they

01:15:31.290 --> 01:15:35.360
spread throughout the strategy
there, of individuals playing.

01:15:35.360 --> 01:15:38.120
How often they drove
the other strategies

01:15:38.120 --> 01:15:41.220
into extinction versus
ones that were quickly

01:15:41.220 --> 01:15:42.830
driven to extinction themselves.

01:15:42.830 --> 01:15:45.730
More cases where we are
getting these systems

01:15:45.730 --> 01:15:48.400
where maybe they're not just
metaphorically using terms

01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:49.580
from biology.

01:15:49.580 --> 01:15:52.670
Maybe they are exactly
modeling the same thing.

01:15:52.670 --> 01:15:55.690
And we will see more and
more evidence for that.

01:15:55.690 --> 01:15:58.170
OK, so reciprocal altruism.

01:15:58.170 --> 01:16:01.670
How would that play out in the
world of natural selection.

01:16:01.670 --> 01:16:04.520
Natural selection,
cooperative hunting.

01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:07.170
And there's lots of species
that have cooperative hunting.

01:16:07.170 --> 01:16:11.234
Wild dogs, jackals, some
other species as well.

01:16:11.234 --> 01:16:12.850
Clearly, that's
like the definition

01:16:12.850 --> 01:16:16.050
of cooperative hunting,
of reciprocal altruism,

01:16:16.050 --> 01:16:17.310
if they're not relatives.

01:16:17.310 --> 01:16:19.660
How would sexual
selection play out

01:16:19.660 --> 01:16:21.580
in the realm of
reciprocal altruism?

01:16:21.580 --> 01:16:23.210
A little bit less obvious there.

01:16:23.210 --> 01:16:25.660
That would be if you
and some non-relative

01:16:25.660 --> 01:16:28.330
spent an insane amount
of energy and time

01:16:28.330 --> 01:16:32.980
making sure you both look really
good before going to the prom.

01:16:32.980 --> 01:16:35.736
That would be sexual selection
working on reciprocal altruism

01:16:35.736 --> 01:16:36.650
system.

01:16:36.650 --> 01:16:40.160
So what we have now are
three building blocks.

01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:43.950
This whole trashing of it's
not survival of the fittest.

01:16:43.950 --> 01:16:46.537
It's not behaving for
the good of the species.

01:16:46.537 --> 01:16:48.370
It's not behaving for
the good of the group.

01:16:48.370 --> 01:16:49.980
But instead, these
three building

01:16:49.980 --> 01:16:54.430
blocks, the ways to optimize
as many copies of your genes

01:16:54.430 --> 01:16:56.290
in the next generation
as possible.

01:16:56.290 --> 01:16:59.620
Way number one,
individual selection,

01:16:59.620 --> 01:17:01.250
a version of selfish genes.

01:17:01.250 --> 01:17:04.500
Sometimes a chicken is an egg's
way of making another egg.

01:17:04.500 --> 01:17:07.260
Behavior is just a way of
getting copies of genes

01:17:07.260 --> 01:17:09.170
into the next generation.

01:17:09.170 --> 01:17:12.587
Piece number two, inclusive
fitness kin selection.

01:17:12.587 --> 01:17:14.420
That whole business,
that sometimes the best

01:17:14.420 --> 01:17:17.160
way of passing on copies
is to help relatives do it.

01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:19.270
And it's a function of
how related they are.

01:17:19.270 --> 01:17:23.850
The whole world of cooperation
more among related organisms

01:17:23.850 --> 01:17:25.330
than unrelated ones.

01:17:25.330 --> 01:17:28.150
And as we will see way
down the line, what

01:17:28.150 --> 01:17:30.480
is very challenging
in different species

01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:33.470
is, how do you figure out
who you are related to?

01:17:33.470 --> 01:17:36.970
And humans do it in a very
unique way that sets them up

01:17:36.970 --> 01:17:40.560
for being exploited in all
sorts of circumstances that

01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:44.470
begin to explain why culture
after culture, people

01:17:44.470 --> 01:17:48.920
are really not nice to thems,
and it flows along those lines.

01:17:48.920 --> 01:17:51.500
This is something we will
get to in a lot of detail.

01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:54.140
So degree of relatedness,
a lecture coming.

01:17:54.140 --> 01:17:56.020
How do you tell who
you're related to.

01:17:56.020 --> 01:17:58.440
But that second
piece, kin selection.

01:17:58.440 --> 01:18:00.800
Third piece,
reciprocal altruism.

01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:03.700
You scratch my back and
I'll scratch your back.

01:18:03.700 --> 01:18:06.775
And whenever possible, you want
to instead scratch your back,

01:18:06.775 --> 01:18:08.150
and they want to
make sure you're

01:18:08.150 --> 01:18:09.310
not scratching your back.

01:18:09.310 --> 01:18:11.020
Or whatever cheating counts as.

01:18:11.020 --> 01:18:13.730
But trying to cheat,
being vigilant against it,

01:18:13.730 --> 01:18:17.750
formal games where you can
optimize it, very complicated.

01:18:17.750 --> 01:18:20.360
And can you believe it, you
go out into the real world,

01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:23.140
and you find examples
of precisely that.

01:18:23.140 --> 01:18:25.830
Optimization with tit for
tat, isn't nature wonderful.

01:18:25.830 --> 01:18:27.470
It's gotta work that way.

01:18:27.470 --> 01:18:30.800
Then you begin to see how the
real world is more complicated.

01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:34.290
Multiple roles, naked mole
rats stuck in plumbing,

01:18:34.290 --> 01:18:36.940
things of that sort.

01:18:36.940 --> 01:18:38.350
These are the principles.

01:18:38.350 --> 01:18:40.930
And what people of this
school of evolutionary thought

01:18:40.930 --> 01:18:44.010
would say, armed with
these sorts of principles,

01:18:44.010 --> 01:18:47.200
you could now look at all
sorts of interesting domains

01:18:47.200 --> 01:18:49.980
of animal behavior
and understand

01:18:49.980 --> 01:18:53.200
what the behavior is going
to be like by using these.

01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:55.290
OK, we start with
the first example.

01:18:55.290 --> 01:18:57.910
Here we return to these guys.

01:18:57.910 --> 01:19:01.280
And we have one species
here, and knowing

01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:03.550
this guy had a penis
and this one nursed,

01:19:03.550 --> 01:19:05.790
we've got an adult male
and an adult female.

01:19:05.790 --> 01:19:07.560
What is it that
you can conclude?

01:19:07.560 --> 01:19:12.680
In this species, males are
a lot bigger than females.

01:19:12.680 --> 01:19:16.740
Let's state it here as there's
a big ratio of males to females.

01:19:16.740 --> 01:19:18.450
Meanwhile in the
next county, you've

01:19:18.450 --> 01:19:21.070
discovered another species
where somebody's got a penis

01:19:21.070 --> 01:19:22.380
and somebody else is nursing.

01:19:22.380 --> 01:19:24.440
And their skulls are
the exact same size.

01:19:24.440 --> 01:19:26.310
Oh, here's a species
where there's

01:19:26.310 --> 01:19:31.130
no difference in body size
between males and females.

01:19:31.130 --> 01:19:33.520
Let's begin to see, just
using the principles

01:19:33.520 --> 01:19:38.140
we've got in hand already, what
sort of stuff we can predict.

01:19:38.140 --> 01:19:41.960
Starting, which of those
species-- in one case,

01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:45.660
you have males being a
lot bigger than females.

01:19:45.660 --> 01:19:49.020
In one case, you've got males
being the same size as females.

01:19:49.020 --> 01:19:51.840
In which of those species,
the first one like this,

01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:53.700
or the same size
ones, which ones

01:19:53.700 --> 01:19:56.360
would you expect to see
more male aggression?

01:19:56.360 --> 01:19:58.280
First one.

01:19:58.280 --> 01:19:58.900
First one.

01:19:58.900 --> 01:20:00.778
OK, how come?

01:20:00.778 --> 01:20:02.230
Their bodies are built for it.

01:20:02.230 --> 01:20:03.760
Their bodies are built for it.

01:20:03.760 --> 01:20:05.410
Which begins to
tell you something,

01:20:05.410 --> 01:20:07.080
their bodies are
built for it, maybe

01:20:07.080 --> 01:20:09.240
because females have
been selecting for that.

01:20:09.240 --> 01:20:12.300
You will see higher
levels of aggression

01:20:12.300 --> 01:20:16.140
in species like this, where
there's a big body size

01:20:16.140 --> 01:20:19.840
difference, and much
less of it in these guys.

01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:23.960
Next, you now ask how
much variability is there

01:20:23.960 --> 01:20:26.320
in male reproductive success.

01:20:26.320 --> 01:20:29.470
In one of these
species, all the males

01:20:29.470 --> 01:20:32.180
have one or two kids
over their lifetime.

01:20:32.180 --> 01:20:35.890
In another species,
95% of the reproducing

01:20:35.890 --> 01:20:38.320
is carried out by
5% of the males.

01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:42.820
A huge variability skew in
male reproductive success.

01:20:42.820 --> 01:20:45.980
Which species do you
get the every male has

01:20:45.980 --> 01:20:49.030
a couple of kids, and that's
about it, and all equally so?

01:20:49.030 --> 01:20:50.010
Which one?

01:20:50.010 --> 01:20:50.720
[INAUDIBLE]

01:20:50.720 --> 01:20:51.530
Second one.

01:20:51.530 --> 01:20:52.200
How come?

01:20:56.750 --> 01:21:00.600
Because these guys are being
selected for aggression.

01:21:00.600 --> 01:21:02.115
If they're fighting,
there's going

01:21:02.115 --> 01:21:03.990
to have to be something
they're fighting for.

01:21:03.990 --> 01:21:06.530
Deferential reproductive access.

01:21:06.530 --> 01:21:13.600
OK, so you see more variability
in species that look like this.

01:21:13.600 --> 01:21:16.090
Next, females come
into the equation.

01:21:16.090 --> 01:21:17.890
What do females want?

01:21:17.890 --> 01:21:20.460
What do females want in
the species on the left

01:21:20.460 --> 01:21:21.840
versus the one on the right?

01:21:21.840 --> 01:21:24.720
The one on the
right, again, skull's

01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:26.260
the same size, same body size.

01:21:26.260 --> 01:21:29.720
On the left, what
does the female want?

01:21:29.720 --> 01:21:32.595
[INAUDIBLE]

01:21:32.595 --> 01:21:35.153
What sort of male is the
female interested in?

01:21:35.153 --> 01:21:36.000
[INAUDIBLE]

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:36.570
Big.

01:21:36.570 --> 01:21:37.520
Exactly.

01:21:37.520 --> 01:21:40.290
That's exactly the
driving force on this.

01:21:40.290 --> 01:21:41.430
How come?

01:21:41.430 --> 01:21:44.615
Because she's not going to get
anything else out of this guy.

01:21:44.615 --> 01:21:46.490
This guy is just going
to, like-- the present

01:21:46.490 --> 01:21:47.573
is going to be some sperm.

01:21:47.573 --> 01:21:50.590
It might as well be some
good sperm, some genetically

01:21:50.590 --> 01:21:53.910
well-endowed sperm that makes
her a big healthy offspring,

01:21:53.910 --> 01:21:57.000
increasing the odds of her
passing on copies of her genes

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:58.550
in the next generation.

01:21:58.550 --> 01:22:01.340
What about in this species?

01:22:01.340 --> 01:22:02.820
What's females looking for?

01:22:05.808 --> 01:22:06.810
[INAUDIBLE]

01:22:06.810 --> 01:22:08.780
OK, good.

01:22:08.780 --> 01:22:10.970
Hold on to that for
a second, and let's

01:22:10.970 --> 01:22:13.470
jump ahead a few lines.

01:22:13.470 --> 01:22:16.810
One of the species,
males have never

01:22:16.810 --> 01:22:20.160
been known to do the slightest
affiliative thing with infants.

01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:22.930
They just get irritated and
harass them and all of that.

01:22:22.930 --> 01:22:25.960
In the other, you
have soccer dads

01:22:25.960 --> 01:22:30.270
who are doing as much raising
of the kids as the females are.

01:22:30.270 --> 01:22:33.990
In which species do you get
lots of male parental behavior?

01:22:33.990 --> 01:22:35.190
Smaller.

01:22:35.190 --> 01:22:36.250
The one on the right.

01:22:36.250 --> 01:22:36.800
OK.

01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:39.227
So lots of male
parental behavior here.

01:22:43.050 --> 01:22:45.850
Somebody just gave the
answer here, female choice.

01:22:45.850 --> 01:22:47.580
What would you see
in this species?

01:22:47.580 --> 01:22:49.680
You want big, muscular guys.

01:22:49.680 --> 01:22:52.520
You want whatever is
selling that season for what

01:22:52.520 --> 01:22:55.890
counts as a hot male, because
you want your offspring

01:22:55.890 --> 01:22:57.440
to have those traits.

01:22:57.440 --> 01:22:59.100
And somebody else
called out here,

01:22:59.100 --> 01:23:01.630
what do females want
in this category?

01:23:01.630 --> 01:23:03.964
And what was it you said?

01:23:03.964 --> 01:23:04.672
Good personality.

01:23:04.672 --> 01:23:05.171
[LAUGHTER]

01:23:05.171 --> 01:23:06.600
Good personality.

01:23:06.600 --> 01:23:08.020
Yes.

01:23:08.020 --> 01:23:09.950
Able to express emotions.

01:23:09.950 --> 01:23:11.276
[LAUGHTER]

01:23:11.276 --> 01:23:13.016
That, too.

01:23:13.016 --> 01:23:14.640
OK, somebody else
shouted out something

01:23:14.640 --> 01:23:18.780
that gets at the broader,
more globally Oprah version.

01:23:18.780 --> 01:23:20.166
OK, somebody shouted out--

01:23:20.166 --> 01:23:21.560
[INAUDIBLE]

01:23:21.560 --> 01:23:23.610
--parental behavior.

01:23:23.610 --> 01:23:26.830
You want a male who is going
to be competent at raising

01:23:26.830 --> 01:23:27.740
your children.

01:23:27.740 --> 01:23:31.110
What is it that you
want, really most deeply?

01:23:31.110 --> 01:23:34.350
You want to get the male who
is the most like a female you

01:23:34.350 --> 01:23:35.730
can get a hold of.

01:23:35.730 --> 01:23:38.050
You don't want some
big old stupid guy

01:23:38.050 --> 01:23:41.390
with a lot of muscle and canines
who's wasting energy on stuff

01:23:41.390 --> 01:23:45.280
like that he could be using
instead on reading Goodnight

01:23:45.280 --> 01:23:47.000
Moon or some such thing.

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:50.260
What you want
instead is somebody

01:23:50.260 --> 01:23:53.140
who's as close to a female as
you can get to without getting

01:23:53.140 --> 01:23:54.670
this lactation stuff.

01:23:54.670 --> 01:23:59.770
Males are chosen who are
the same size as females.

01:23:59.770 --> 01:24:04.670
So the term given here is
choosing for paternal behavior,

01:24:04.670 --> 01:24:06.130
parental behavior.

01:24:06.130 --> 01:24:08.250
Parental, let's just
put that in there.

01:24:08.250 --> 01:24:11.130
And that begins to explain
the top line, species

01:24:11.130 --> 01:24:14.480
in which there's a lot
of sexual dimorphism.

01:24:14.480 --> 01:24:16.300
Morphism, shapes of things.

01:24:16.300 --> 01:24:18.470
Sexual dimorphism,
big difference

01:24:18.470 --> 01:24:21.540
in body size as a
function of gender.

01:24:21.540 --> 01:24:23.680
And in these sorts
of species where

01:24:23.680 --> 01:24:25.780
you get male parental
behavior, not

01:24:25.780 --> 01:24:27.844
much variability in male
reproductive success,

01:24:27.844 --> 01:24:29.260
low levels of
aggression, and what

01:24:29.260 --> 01:24:31.450
females want is
a competent male.

01:24:31.450 --> 01:24:35.650
These are ones where you see low
degrees of sexual dimorphism.

01:24:35.650 --> 01:24:37.490
So how's a female
going to figure out

01:24:37.490 --> 01:24:40.090
that this guy is going
to be a competent parent?

01:24:40.090 --> 01:24:43.240
Once again, we just figured out,
if he looks kind of like you.

01:24:43.240 --> 01:24:46.520
Because that suggests he hasn't
wasted health and metabolism

01:24:46.520 --> 01:24:48.470
on stupid, pointless
muscles when there's

01:24:48.470 --> 01:24:50.380
more important things
in life for making sure

01:24:50.380 --> 01:24:51.820
your kids have good values.

01:24:51.820 --> 01:24:54.270
What else would the female
want to know when she's first

01:24:54.270 --> 01:24:55.895
considering mating with a male?

01:24:58.630 --> 01:25:00.162
Is he a nice guy,
is he sensitive,

01:25:00.162 --> 01:25:01.370
does he express his feelings.

01:25:01.370 --> 01:25:04.630
Is he competent
at being a parent.

01:25:04.630 --> 01:25:06.760
What do you want the
individual to do?

01:25:06.760 --> 01:25:10.620
Prove to you that he can
provide for the kids.

01:25:10.620 --> 01:25:15.370
And suddenly you have a world of
male birds courting the females

01:25:15.370 --> 01:25:17.310
by bringing them worms.

01:25:17.310 --> 01:25:19.220
Bringing them
evidence that they are

01:25:19.220 --> 01:25:22.620
able to successfully forage,
they are able to get food.

01:25:22.620 --> 01:25:25.500
Female choice is built
around appearance

01:25:25.500 --> 01:25:27.990
and behavioral
competence at being

01:25:27.990 --> 01:25:30.150
able to be a successful
parent in order

01:25:30.150 --> 01:25:31.570
to pass on as many
copies of genes

01:25:31.570 --> 01:25:33.150
to the next generation
as possible.

01:25:33.150 --> 01:25:35.540
OK, how about life span.

01:25:35.540 --> 01:25:39.160
In which species is there a big
difference in life expectancy

01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:41.184
as a function of gender?

01:25:41.184 --> 01:25:42.540
First one.

01:25:42.540 --> 01:25:43.400
First one.

01:25:43.400 --> 01:25:45.070
Here you're choosing
for males to be

01:25:45.070 --> 01:25:47.880
as close to females as possible,
and thus the physiology.

01:25:47.880 --> 01:25:50.390
Here you've got
these guys who are

01:25:50.390 --> 01:25:52.910
using huge amounts
of energy to build up

01:25:52.910 --> 01:25:55.560
all this muscle, which
takes a lot more work

01:25:55.560 --> 01:25:57.200
to keep in calories.

01:25:57.200 --> 01:25:59.190
And you're more
vulnerable in famines.

01:25:59.190 --> 01:26:01.910
You've got these males
with high testosterone,

01:26:01.910 --> 01:26:05.080
which does bad stuff to
your circulatory system.

01:26:05.080 --> 01:26:07.890
You've got males who, thanks
to all this aggression,

01:26:07.890 --> 01:26:10.250
are getting more
injuries, more likely.

01:26:10.250 --> 01:26:13.690
In species in which you have
a lot of sexual dimorphism

01:26:13.690 --> 01:26:19.050
in body size, you get a lot of
sexual dimorphism in life span.

01:26:19.050 --> 01:26:21.790
Then you look at these
guys, and it's basically

01:26:21.790 --> 01:26:23.540
no difference by gender.

01:26:23.540 --> 01:26:25.110
Moving on.

01:26:25.110 --> 01:26:27.030
Considering primates
that are one

01:26:27.030 --> 01:26:30.280
of these two patterns, in
which one do you always

01:26:30.280 --> 01:26:32.930
want to give birth to twins,
in which one do you never

01:26:32.930 --> 01:26:34.130
want to give birth to twins?

01:26:34.130 --> 01:26:35.983
Who gives birth to twins?

01:26:35.983 --> 01:26:36.690
[INAUDIBLE]

01:26:36.690 --> 01:26:38.160
The one of the right, of course.

01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:38.890
How come?

01:26:38.890 --> 01:26:41.010
Because you've got two
parents on the scene.

01:26:41.010 --> 01:26:42.560
You are not a single mother.

01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:45.300
And you are a single mother
rhesus monkey or something,

01:26:45.300 --> 01:26:47.820
and you give birth to
twins, and you do not

01:26:47.820 --> 01:26:50.230
have the remotest
chance of enough energy,

01:26:50.230 --> 01:26:53.710
enough calories on board, to
get both of them to survive.

01:26:53.710 --> 01:26:57.770
A twin that is born
in a species like this

01:26:57.770 --> 01:27:01.000
has the same rate that it occurs
in humans, about a 1% rate.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:04.390
And it is almost inevitable that
one of them does not survive.

01:27:04.390 --> 01:27:07.520
Meanwhile, there's a whole
world of primate species

01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:10.520
with this profile where
the females always twin.

01:27:13.460 --> 01:27:16.210
Finally, you are
the female and you

01:27:16.210 --> 01:27:19.590
are contemplating
bailing out on your kids

01:27:19.590 --> 01:27:21.020
and disappearing,
because there's

01:27:21.020 --> 01:27:24.540
some really hot guy over there
who you want to mate with.

01:27:24.540 --> 01:27:27.420
And you are trying to
figure out this strategy.

01:27:27.420 --> 01:27:30.760
So you are going to leave
and abandon your kids.

01:27:30.760 --> 01:27:34.080
In which species do
you see that behavior?

01:27:34.080 --> 01:27:35.070
The one on the right.

01:27:35.070 --> 01:27:37.980
The one on the right, because
you bail out and the male

01:27:37.980 --> 01:27:39.200
is there taking care of them.

01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:42.670
You bail out in here, and you've
lost your investment and copies

01:27:42.670 --> 01:27:44.350
your genes for the
next generation.

01:27:44.350 --> 01:27:48.050
You see female cuckoldry,
this great Victorian term.

01:27:48.050 --> 01:27:51.770
You see females cheating on
the fathers in this species,

01:27:51.770 --> 01:27:53.580
but not in species like this.

01:27:53.580 --> 01:27:58.060
Because the father is long gone
and three other counties there,

01:27:58.060 --> 01:27:59.430
courting somebody else.

01:27:59.430 --> 01:28:00.920
And it doesn't
matter, you're not

01:28:00.920 --> 01:28:02.370
going to get any help from him.

01:28:02.370 --> 01:28:04.650
In primate species
of this profile,

01:28:04.650 --> 01:28:06.650
you always see twinning.

01:28:06.650 --> 01:28:08.440
And they both survive.

01:28:08.440 --> 01:28:10.660
And what studies have
shown in these species,

01:28:10.660 --> 01:28:12.420
and we'll get to
them shortly, is

01:28:12.420 --> 01:28:16.434
after birth, in fact, the males
are expending more calories

01:28:16.434 --> 01:28:17.850
taking care of the
offspring, then

01:28:17.850 --> 01:28:22.570
the females go bail out on him
and go find some other hot guy.

01:28:22.570 --> 01:28:24.320
Which, in your species,
counts as some guy

01:28:24.320 --> 01:28:27.400
who looks even more like you
than he does in terms of what

01:28:27.400 --> 01:28:29.190
you want out of the individual.

01:28:29.190 --> 01:28:29.967
So that.

01:28:29.967 --> 01:28:31.050
So what have we done here?

01:28:31.050 --> 01:28:33.700
We've just gone through
applying these principles

01:28:33.700 --> 01:28:35.590
in this logical
way, and everybody

01:28:35.590 --> 01:28:38.550
from the very first step was
getting the right outcome.

01:28:38.550 --> 01:28:41.800
And go, and these are
exactly the profiles

01:28:41.800 --> 01:28:43.600
you find in certain species.

01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:46.420
Among social mammals,
these would be referred to

01:28:46.420 --> 01:28:48.770
as a tournament species.

01:28:48.770 --> 01:28:51.470
A tournament species,
whereas the one on the right

01:28:51.470 --> 01:28:55.730
is referred to as a pair
bonding, a monogamous species.

01:28:55.730 --> 01:28:58.420
Because in this one,
males and females

01:28:58.420 --> 01:29:01.840
stay together, because they
both have equivalent investment

01:29:01.840 --> 01:29:03.120
in taking care of the kids.

01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:04.000
All of that.

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:05.830
What you have here
is this contrast

01:29:05.830 --> 01:29:10.010
between tournament species
and pair bonding species.

01:29:10.010 --> 01:29:13.020
Tournament species,
these are all the species

01:29:13.020 --> 01:29:16.690
where you get males with
big, bright plumage.

01:29:16.690 --> 01:29:19.660
These are peacocks,
these are all those birds

01:29:19.660 --> 01:29:22.640
and fish species where the
males are all brightly colored.

01:29:22.640 --> 01:29:25.000
What are the females
choosing for?

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:28.580
Peacock feathers does not make
for a good peacock mother.

01:29:28.580 --> 01:29:31.860
Peacock feathers are signs
of being healthy enough

01:29:31.860 --> 01:29:33.640
that you can waste
lots of energy

01:29:33.640 --> 01:29:35.740
on these big stupid
pointless feathers.

01:29:35.740 --> 01:29:37.470
That's a sign of health.

01:29:37.470 --> 01:29:41.030
That's a sign of all I'm getting
from this peacock is genes,

01:29:41.030 --> 01:29:42.750
I might as well
go for good ones.

01:29:42.750 --> 01:29:44.250
That's the world
of peacocks, that's

01:29:44.250 --> 01:29:46.930
the world of chickens
with pecking orders,

01:29:46.930 --> 01:29:49.210
dominating like that,
lots of aggression.

01:29:49.210 --> 01:29:53.210
That's the world of primates
where, as in savanna baboons,

01:29:53.210 --> 01:29:55.560
the male is twice as
big as the female.

01:29:55.560 --> 01:30:00.010
Tournament species, where a
lot of passing on of genes

01:30:00.010 --> 01:30:03.570
is decided by male-male
aggression in the context

01:30:03.570 --> 01:30:07.950
of tournaments producing
massive amounts of variability

01:30:07.950 --> 01:30:09.440
in reproductive success.

01:30:09.440 --> 01:30:12.300
Where males are being selected
for being good at this,

01:30:12.300 --> 01:30:15.260
so they sure are being selected
for having big bodies, which

01:30:15.260 --> 01:30:16.814
winds up meaning
a shortened life

01:30:16.814 --> 01:30:17.980
span for a bunch of reasons.

01:30:17.980 --> 01:30:19.600
Females are choosing for that.

01:30:19.600 --> 01:30:21.620
These are guys who are
not using their energy

01:30:21.620 --> 01:30:23.840
on parental behavior,
thus you do not

01:30:23.840 --> 01:30:26.160
want to have twins if
you are a female baboon,

01:30:26.160 --> 01:30:28.030
and you do not want to
bail out on the kids

01:30:28.030 --> 01:30:30.170
because nobody else is
going to take care of them.

01:30:30.170 --> 01:30:33.020
Go and look at a
new primate species,

01:30:33.020 --> 01:30:36.100
and see this much of a
difference in skull size,

01:30:36.100 --> 01:30:38.260
and you'd just be able
to derive everything

01:30:38.260 --> 01:30:40.420
else about its social behavior.

01:30:40.420 --> 01:30:44.140
Meanwhile, these guys on the
right, pair bonding species.

01:30:44.140 --> 01:30:47.300
These are found among South
American monkeys, marmosets,

01:30:47.300 --> 01:30:48.180
tamarins.

01:30:48.180 --> 01:30:50.010
You put up a picture
of them, which

01:30:50.010 --> 01:30:51.866
I will do if I ever
master PowerPoint

01:30:51.866 --> 01:30:53.490
in some subsequent
lecture-- you put up

01:30:53.490 --> 01:30:56.590
a picture of a marmoset
pair, and you can't tell

01:30:56.590 --> 01:30:58.340
who's the male and the female.

01:30:58.340 --> 01:31:00.570
This is not the world
of the mandrill baboons,

01:31:00.570 --> 01:31:04.310
with males with big, bright,
bizarre coloration on the face,

01:31:04.310 --> 01:31:06.700
and with antlers when
the females don't,

01:31:06.700 --> 01:31:09.681
and that whole world
of sexual dimorphism.

01:31:09.681 --> 01:31:11.180
You can't tell which
one is the male

01:31:11.180 --> 01:31:13.920
and which one is the female
marmoset by looking at them.

01:31:13.920 --> 01:31:16.180
You can't tell by seeing
how long they live.

01:31:16.180 --> 01:31:17.630
You can't tell by
how much they're

01:31:17.630 --> 01:31:19.180
taking care of the kids.

01:31:19.180 --> 01:31:22.180
You can't tell in terms of
their reproductive variability.

01:31:22.180 --> 01:31:24.560
That's a whole different
world of selection.

01:31:24.560 --> 01:31:27.950
All of the South American
tamarins and marmosets,

01:31:27.950 --> 01:31:30.010
the females always twin.

01:31:30.010 --> 01:31:31.710
They have a higher
rate of cuckoldry,

01:31:31.710 --> 01:31:33.400
of abandoning the kids.

01:31:33.400 --> 01:31:35.520
The males take as much
care, if not more,

01:31:35.520 --> 01:31:37.100
of the kids than
the female does.

01:31:37.100 --> 01:31:38.470
Very low levels of aggression.

01:31:38.470 --> 01:31:40.320
Same body size, same lifespan.

01:31:40.320 --> 01:31:43.020
All the males have low
degree of variability.

01:31:43.020 --> 01:31:43.880
How come?

01:31:43.880 --> 01:31:45.910
Because if you're
some marmoset male,

01:31:45.910 --> 01:31:49.150
you don't want to get 47
marmoset females pregnant.

01:31:49.150 --> 01:31:51.970
Because you are going to have
to take care of all the kids.

01:31:51.970 --> 01:31:55.010
Because as we will see way
down the line in lectures

01:31:55.010 --> 01:31:57.900
on parental behavior,
the wiring there is such

01:31:57.900 --> 01:32:01.310
is bonding with the offspring
and taking care of them.

01:32:01.310 --> 01:32:03.870
No wonder among
species like these,

01:32:03.870 --> 01:32:05.810
you have very low variability.

01:32:05.810 --> 01:32:08.100
All the males reproduce
once or twice.

01:32:08.100 --> 01:32:10.780
This is the world of 5%
of the guys accounting

01:32:10.780 --> 01:32:12.890
for 95% of the matings.

01:32:12.890 --> 01:32:16.160
This is totally
remarkable because again,

01:32:16.160 --> 01:32:17.320
that starting point.

01:32:17.320 --> 01:32:19.320
You start off here,
and you look at these,

01:32:19.320 --> 01:32:21.530
and oh, you can tell if
they were bipedal and were

01:32:21.530 --> 01:32:24.650
they diseased or malnourished,
simply by applying

01:32:24.650 --> 01:32:28.200
these principles of individual
selection, reciprocity,

01:32:28.200 --> 01:32:29.050
all of that.

01:32:29.050 --> 01:32:32.230
One factoid, you see
a new primate species,

01:32:32.230 --> 01:32:34.760
and you see one nursing
and one with a penis,

01:32:34.760 --> 01:32:37.820
and they're the same size or
there's difference in the size,

01:32:37.820 --> 01:32:40.850
and you already know all
about their social system.

01:32:40.850 --> 01:32:46.620
Very consistent across birds,
across fish, across primates.

01:32:46.620 --> 01:32:48.730
Of course, all of
those, this dichotomy

01:32:48.730 --> 01:32:52.210
between tournament species
and pair bonding species.

01:32:52.210 --> 01:32:54.570
As we will see
way down the line,

01:32:54.570 --> 01:32:57.540
among some species,
types of voles, rodents,

01:32:57.540 --> 01:33:01.060
that are famous in Hallmark
cards for their pair bonding,

01:33:01.060 --> 01:33:02.310
for their monogamy.

01:33:02.310 --> 01:33:04.560
As we'll see, they're
not quite as monogamous

01:33:04.560 --> 01:33:05.390
as you would think.

01:33:05.390 --> 01:33:09.190
But nonetheless, a general
structure like this.

01:33:09.190 --> 01:33:14.860
So, one asks expectedly, where
do humans fit in on this one?

01:33:14.860 --> 01:33:16.530
Where do humans fit?

01:33:16.530 --> 01:33:19.320
And the answer
is, complicatedly.

01:33:19.320 --> 01:33:22.820
Are we a tournament species,
are we a pair bonding species.

01:33:22.820 --> 01:33:24.240
What's up with that?

01:33:24.240 --> 01:33:28.520
What we will see is
we're kind of in between.

01:33:28.520 --> 01:33:31.310
When you look at the degree
of sexual dimorphism,

01:33:31.310 --> 01:33:34.440
we are not like baboons, but
we're sure not like marmosets.

01:33:34.440 --> 01:33:36.080
We're somewhere in the middle.

01:33:36.080 --> 01:33:39.530
Variability is somewhere
in the middle there.

01:33:39.530 --> 01:33:41.250
I'm not going near that one.

01:33:41.250 --> 01:33:44.200
Life span, the
dimorphism in lifespan

01:33:44.200 --> 01:33:46.880
tends to be in between.

01:33:46.880 --> 01:33:49.290
Parental behavior and
likelihood-- all of those,

01:33:49.290 --> 01:33:50.800
you look at a
number of measures.

01:33:50.800 --> 01:33:53.370
And by next lecture,
we'll be looking

01:33:53.370 --> 01:33:56.570
at some genetics of what
a monogamous species

01:33:56.570 --> 01:33:58.560
and tournament
species look like.

01:33:58.560 --> 01:34:00.780
And we're right in the middle.

01:34:00.780 --> 01:34:04.980
In other words, that explains
like 90% of literature.

01:34:04.980 --> 01:34:08.010
Because we're not a classic
tournament species and we're

01:34:08.010 --> 01:34:09.760
not a classic pair bonding one.

01:34:09.760 --> 01:34:12.790
We are terribly confused
in the middle there.

01:34:12.790 --> 01:34:17.250
And everything about
anthropology supports that.

01:34:17.250 --> 01:34:19.980
Most people on the
planet right now

01:34:19.980 --> 01:34:23.220
are in a form of
monogamous relationships

01:34:23.220 --> 01:34:28.000
in a culture that
demands monogamy.

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.700
An awful lot of people who are
in monogamous relationships

01:34:30.700 --> 01:34:33.910
in such cultures aren't really
in monogamous relationships.

01:34:33.910 --> 01:34:38.850
Traditionally, most cultures on
this planet allowed polygamy.

01:34:38.850 --> 01:34:41.960
Nonetheless, in most of
those polygamous cultures,

01:34:41.960 --> 01:34:45.760
the majority of individuals
were pair bonded and monogamous.

01:34:45.760 --> 01:34:47.690
You get two different
versions of polygamy

01:34:47.690 --> 01:34:49.650
in different social
systems of humans.

01:34:49.650 --> 01:34:53.620
One is economic polygamy,
which is you're basically

01:34:53.620 --> 01:34:57.200
sitting around, and the
wealthiest guy in the village

01:34:57.200 --> 01:35:00.680
is the one who can have the
largest number of wives.

01:35:00.680 --> 01:35:02.910
An enormous skew in
reproductive success

01:35:02.910 --> 01:35:04.800
that's driven by economics.

01:35:04.800 --> 01:35:06.970
The other type is demographic.

01:35:06.970 --> 01:35:09.380
You have a culture
where, for example, you

01:35:09.380 --> 01:35:11.050
have a warrior class.

01:35:11.050 --> 01:35:14.570
Guys spend 10 years as
warriors-- worriers, warriors,

01:35:14.570 --> 01:35:15.920
New York City accent.

01:35:15.920 --> 01:35:17.870
As warriors, they don't worry.

01:35:17.870 --> 01:35:18.730
There's no anxiety.

01:35:18.730 --> 01:35:20.350
But they eventually worry
about getting a wife,

01:35:20.350 --> 01:35:22.450
because by the time they're
done being a warrior,

01:35:22.450 --> 01:35:24.060
they're like 25.

01:35:24.060 --> 01:35:26.330
And they marry someone
who's 13, which

01:35:26.330 --> 01:35:28.520
is what you see in a lot
of traditional cultures

01:35:28.520 --> 01:35:29.970
that follow that pattern.

01:35:29.970 --> 01:35:32.460
And at that point,
you've got a problem,

01:35:32.460 --> 01:35:35.260
which is an awful lot of
those guys have been killed

01:35:35.260 --> 01:35:38.220
over the course of 10
years of being involved

01:35:38.220 --> 01:35:41.030
in high levels of aggression
and 10 more years of life

01:35:41.030 --> 01:35:42.610
expectancy to catch up with you.

01:35:42.610 --> 01:35:44.640
There's is a shortage of males.

01:35:44.640 --> 01:35:48.000
So you see polygamy there
driven by demographics,

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.660
and you see polygamy
driven by economics

01:35:50.660 --> 01:35:52.270
in other types of society.

01:35:52.270 --> 01:35:56.070
So most cultures on this
planet allow-- traditionally,

01:35:56.070 --> 01:35:57.690
before the
missionaries got them--

01:35:57.690 --> 01:36:00.530
most cultures on this
planet allow polygamy.

01:36:00.530 --> 01:36:03.520
Nonetheless, within most
polygamous cultures,

01:36:03.520 --> 01:36:06.270
the majority of people
are not polygamous.

01:36:06.270 --> 01:36:10.580
We have one really confused,
screwed up species here.

01:36:10.580 --> 01:36:14.160
Because we are halfway in
between in all sorts of these

01:36:14.160 --> 01:36:15.190
measures.

01:36:15.190 --> 01:36:17.770
OK, so what do we
have next, which

01:36:17.770 --> 01:36:19.240
we will pick up on Friday.

01:36:19.240 --> 01:36:20.940
What we've just
started with here

01:36:20.940 --> 01:36:23.810
is the first case of using
all these principles,

01:36:23.810 --> 01:36:26.590
individual selection, kin
selection, reciprocal altruism,

01:36:26.590 --> 01:36:29.390
to understand all sorts
of aspects of behavior.

01:36:29.390 --> 01:36:31.770
We will then move
on to seeing how

01:36:31.770 --> 01:36:35.040
they explain other aspects
of animal behavior, some ones

01:36:35.040 --> 01:36:38.290
which, if you are behaving for
the good of the species circa

01:36:38.290 --> 01:36:42.070
1960, there's no explanation
at all, because you're

01:36:42.070 --> 01:36:45.520
doing things like killing
other members of your species.

01:36:45.520 --> 01:36:47.620
And then finally,
we will see how

01:36:47.620 --> 01:36:51.090
this applies to humans and
some of the witheringly

01:36:51.090 --> 01:36:52.930
appropriate--

01:36:52.930 --> 01:36:56.190
