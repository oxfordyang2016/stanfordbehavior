[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.992 --> 00:00:05.825
Stanford University.

00:00:05.825 --> 00:00:08.039
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:09.940
So back a little bit.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:11.580
Still back in the neurobiology.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.130
Back to the anterior cingulate.

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.280
Remember anterior
cingulate again.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.500
All that empathy stuff,
feeling somebody else's pain.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.880
That business about
something metaphorical,

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.060
something symbolic
about pain and empathy

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.320
is happening in there.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.230
Something people
have been speculating

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.690
about for about 10
years now has to do

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:31.520
with a class of
neurons that have come

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.030
to be called mirror neurons.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.100
Mirror neurons were
first identified

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.810
in motor parts of the
cortex, parts that

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.390
tell you which muscles to move.

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.560
And these are neurons
that don't get excited

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.580
when you are, for example,
moving your arm like this.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.450
And they don't get excited
if you're watching somebody

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.150
moving their arm like this.

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.380
But they do get
excited if both of you

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.280
are doing it at the same time or
closely in time with each other

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.220
if they're mirroring each other.

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.570
So people took a
look at this and this

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.660
immediately became an
area of a lot of research.

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:08.280
And from the first nanosecond
when people were discussing

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.710
mirror neurons, of course
what they were immediately

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.530
talking about is this is
some neuronal cellular basis

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.590
of empathy, feeling
somebody else's pain.

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:19.640
That sort of thing.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.600
There's got to be mirror neurons
in the anterior cingulate

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.740
that's doing more abstract
versions of feeling somebody

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.820
else's actions and feeling
somebody else's feelings

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.030
and all that sort of thing.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.810
Totally irresistible.

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.360
There has not been
a paper written

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.090
on the neurobiology of
empathy in the last decade

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.050
without the word mirror getting
some place or other in there.

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:42.630
Totally cool idea.

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.770
Still not yet demonstrated.

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.950
Shifting over, covering
a little more ground.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.190
That business again
about sort of storage

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.740
of very abstract new
stuff, symbolic stuff,

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.700
into our clanky old
mammalian brains.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.020
The notion of having to mix in
symbolic metaphorical functions

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.200
into areas of the brain
that do it very literally.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.880
What comes through with
that is strong support

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.380
for the argument of someone like
Haidt, that guy the other day,

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.800
arguing that moral reasoning
is mostly after the fact.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.570
It's rationalization
for moral affect.

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.870
Mostly what we're having is
an initial moral affective

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.160
responses.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.180
And that's built around
the power of, for example,

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.070
a symbolic moral failure to
cause the same neurons to get

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.250
excited in your brain that would
tell you that you're disgusted

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.770
with rotten food, the
visceralness, the sort

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:41.980
of salience of it,
the whole notion

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.110
there being in his work
more and more support

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.900
for it that an awful lot
of the time moral reasoning

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.290
is coming after the moral
decision has been made

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.100
along the lines of affect.

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.170
And a lot of the brain
imaging work by now

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.860
is showing evidence for this.

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.800
And again, the strongest
sort of evidence

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.080
is when you go through
the list of things,

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.480
would you eat your
pet after it died?

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.260
Is incest OK if it's
post-reproductive?

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.530
And all the ways in which people
say, I can't tell you why,

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:11.680
but it's wrong.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.080
That shouldn't be allowed.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.640
And what that is over
and over in those cases

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.200
is a demonstration of the
affective moral decision making

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.200
coming before the
moral reasoning.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.900
So really important
feature of his work.

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.800
Backfilling on some
neurotransmitter stuff,

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:28.770
neurochemistry.

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:33.530
I managed to completely forget
poor, innocent serotonin coming

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:34.530
into the picture.

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.480
What we covered on
Wednesday was dopamine

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.410
and the ability of
dopamine to, in effect,

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.660
give the frontal
cortex the energy

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.550
to do the emotional
regulation stuff.

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:46.930
In effect, if what
the frontal cortex

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.140
is saying to all of
the limbic system

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.940
on many occasions is,
don't do, it don't do it,

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.540
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.520
What the dopaminergic
projections

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.620
into the frontal
cortex are doing

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.120
is telling the frontal cortex,
tell the limbic system not

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.190
to do it because it's going to
be amazing if they can hold out

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:05.080
down there.

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.220
The dopamine system, in terms
of the anticipation of reward.

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.390
Now switching over to
another neurotransmitter

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.402
that gets lots of attention
in this business-- serotonin.

00:04:15.402 --> 00:04:16.860
Before it's over
with, we are going

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:19.540
to hear about serotonin
in coming weeks having

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.150
to do with a bunch of different
psychiatric disorders.

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.150
But this is serotonin in some
frontal cortical related areas

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.430
of the brain seeming
to have something

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.050
to do with aggression
and impulsive behavior.

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:33.240
What's the evidence?

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.150
First off, the totally
correlative stuff.

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.310
Look at levels of serotonin in
animals, experimental animals,

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.610
in these projection areas that
go into the frontal cortex.

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:48.560
Lower levels of serotonin
predicting more impulsive,

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.450
more aggressive behavior.

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:52.610
Consistent finding in the field.

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:56.900
Consistent finding when you then
switch over to humans and look

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.929
at something that you
cannot do in a human,

00:04:59.929 --> 00:05:02.220
not looking at something that
you can't do in a human--

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:03.040
whatever.

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.950
You can't look at serotonin
levels and somebody's brain

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:08.630
because you're not going to
slice it out and measure stuff.

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:10.310
What that whole
literature is about

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.580
is instead looking at
this synthetic pathway.

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:18.020
How is serotonin broken
down, these two enzymes here.

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.660
MOA, monoamine oxidase,
this one broken down

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:25.680
into a waste product called
5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid.

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.140
Do not write that down.

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:28.370
5-HIAA.

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.850
The main point being
that in a human

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:33.350
you can't measure levels
of this very readily.

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:35.540
You measure this in
the blood stream,

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:40.080
in the cerebral spinal fluid,
in the urine, places like that.

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.820
And the literature is
showing that lower levels

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:46.080
of serotonin breakdown
products are correlated

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.980
in humans with higher levels
of aggression and antisocial

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:51.730
behavior.

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:54.640
You should be able to rip that
one to shreds within seconds.

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.270
Number one, this
is just correlative

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:59.880
and you could very easily
imagine horses and carts

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.470
getting all confused here.

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:03.780
The second thing
is remember when

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.130
you're measuring
neurotransmitter junk

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:07.980
in the bloodstream
or the urine, you're

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:11.329
measuring the junk of all the
gazillion different places

00:06:11.329 --> 00:06:12.995
in the brain where
this neurotransmitter

00:06:12.995 --> 00:06:17.000
is being used for things have
nothing to do with aspects

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.890
of aggression, impulsivity.

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:21.170
It's really hard
to tell anything.

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:22.800
Nonetheless, the
animal literature

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.540
has been pretty
consistent with this.

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:26.010
So back to correlation.

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:28.100
Which is causing which,
which is causing which?

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:29.940
Then you could do
the animal studies

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:34.660
showing that when you manipulate
serotonin levels in something

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:36.940
like a rat or a
primate, drive down

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:40.040
serotonin levels in the
frontal cortical region

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.700
and you get more
aggressive behavior.

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:44.730
You get more impulsivity.

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:47.700
So evidence for that there
actually being causal.

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:49.950
Something similar
or a building block

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:52.290
of that, studies that
have been done in humans.

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:53.800
You don't slice
somebody's head open

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.340
and measure their
serotonin levels,

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:57.320
but instead in
this case you give

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:01.840
a drug which, for a short
period, will mimic serotonin.

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:04.120
and It will mimic serotonin
in the way serotonin

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:06.860
interacts with the receptors
in the frontal cortex,

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:09.620
your buzzing serotonin pathways.

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:12.150
In those individuals in
the frontal cortex what do

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:13.740
you wind up seeing?

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:16.710
Increased metabolism
in the frontal cortex.

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:20.600
Serotonin stimulates
frontal metabolism

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:26.130
except in individuals with a
history of antisocial violence.

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:27.950
What's that
beginning to suggest?

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:31.890
Part of what serotonin is doing
is joining in with dopamine

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:34.250
to stimulate the
frontal cortex, get

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:37.510
the I wouldn't do that if I
were you really, really, hold on

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:40.430
don't do it, pathways
down to the limbic system.

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:43.000
And part of the
evidence we're seeing,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.870
violent sociopaths having lower
than normal metabolic rates

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:48.250
in the frontal cortex.

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:51.450
Some of these pieces
beginning to come together.

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:55.120
So a lot is relevant in
terms of levels of this.

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:58.390
Immediately one
starts thinking genes.

00:07:58.390 --> 00:08:02.540
Genes related to the various
types of serotonin receptors.

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:04.710
Genes related to the
enzymes that make

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:06.670
serotonin, that break it down.

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:10.410
And there's a literature
that's emerging on that one.

00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:14.510
First off, it is a really tough
literature to make sense of.

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:17.520
As follows, suppose
you are studying

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:20.570
some population of people
who are very aggressive

00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:22.500
and you're measuring
this breakdown

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:24.810
product in their bloodstream
and you see there's

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:27.780
very low levels in the stuff.

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:28.660
OK.

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:31.320
So how do you interpret that if?

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:35.049
You believe that low
levels of serotonin

00:08:35.049 --> 00:08:36.650
give rise to aggression.

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:38.590
So what's your interpretation?

00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:41.059
Low levels of this,
because you're not

00:08:41.059 --> 00:08:42.340
making much serotonin.

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:43.840
If you're not making
much serotonin,

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:46.270
you're not getting much
serotonin breakdown product,

00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:48.470
support for the idea
that aggression is

00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:51.750
caused by too little serotonin.

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:55.810
Suppose instead you like the
idea of too much serotonin

00:08:55.810 --> 00:08:56.970
causing aggression.

00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:58.450
What would you then say?

00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:00.520
Well, suppose there
is a mutation in one

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:04.360
of these enzymes that's supposed
to break down serotonin.

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:06.450
And because of the
mutation, it doesn't.

00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:07.560
What's going to happen?

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:10.880
Serotonin doesn't get broken
down, it's levels build up,

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:13.630
and thus you'll see
low levels of that.

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:16.500
In other words, the
same exact finding

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:19.600
can tell either elevated or
lower than normal levels.

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.834
Completely uninterpretable
when you're

00:09:21.834 --> 00:09:23.500
trying to make sense
of what's happening

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:26.250
in an organism like a human
where you can't actually

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:27.670
measure at this step.

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:29.520
So there could be low
levels because there

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:30.910
is low levels of everything.

00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:32.680
Or there could be
low levels because,

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:36.370
thanks to a blockade here, the
levels of this are building up.

00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:39.160
Totally impossible to
separate those out.

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:40.880
In some of the
studies in the field

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:44.750
have really strongly voted
for one type of conclusion

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:47.310
based on human studies
measuring that stuff

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:49.840
where it simply can't be done.

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:51.630
How about the genetics, though?

00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:57.530
What you see are differences
in variance of the gene.

00:09:57.530 --> 00:10:00.240
That's the critical one
for making serotonin.

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:04.030
Basically concept, if
you're not a bio chem type,

00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:06.960
if there is a couple of steps
needed to make something

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:09.620
and one step is really,
really important,

00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:11.770
basically like if
this first step

00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:14.680
occurs you're guaranteed
that the second one will.

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:17.470
And the first step is the
one that's a little bit iffy.

00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:20.450
That would be referred
to as the rate limiting

00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:22.180
step in the pathway.

00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:26.740
The rate limiting enzyme, this
enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase,

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:30.790
is the rate limiting step in
the synthesis of serotonin.

00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:34.360
And by now, there is a
literature showing variance

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:37.120
on tryptophan
hydroxylase in people.

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:40.100
Variance in non-human
primates that

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:43.960
begin to correlate a bit
with how much of this,

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:45.290
how much of aggression.

00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:46.400
Not big effects.

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:49.310
Back to our statistics lecture,
the findings are there.

00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:51.270
They're not big effects, though.

00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:53.250
Meanwhile, at the
other end, people

00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:56.990
have been looking at genetic
variants on these guys

00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:59.460
and that literature is
coming through also.

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:01.120
Different variants
that appear to have

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:03.790
different levels of
activity correlated

00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:06.670
with different levels of
aggression, different levels

00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:08.130
of breakdown products.

00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:10.290
So that's out there as well.

00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:13.770
But immediately we've got
something going straight back

00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:16.680
to four different earlier
lectures, the point being made

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:20.840
over and over, scale graph
by now where exactly where

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:23.810
this one is heading-- if
I can get the right ink--

00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:38.690
which is-- OK.

00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:42.880
So variants on this MAO
gene, this monoamine oxidase.

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:45.590
It comes in two
different flavors.

00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:48.590
And what you've got is in
terms of how they function.

00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:51.590
One of them should
be predisposing

00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:55.740
towards more serotonin
signaling than the other.

00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:58.980
And thus you would predict that
the one that predisposes you

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:02.260
towards less serotonin
signaling in the frontal cortex

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.690
should be associated with
higher levels of aggression.

00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:09.330
And thus we go back to that same
exact study, that same group

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:11.470
that did the study
looking at the interaction

00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:14.990
between depression, serotonin
transporter gene, all of that,

00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:16.420
looking at those data.

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:20.480
Now what they were asking
was by age 25 or so

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:24.530
what was the incidence of
antisocial violent behavior

00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:27.300
in this population
of 17,000 kids

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:31.220
and what does that have to
do with which variant of MAO

00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:31.970
they had?

00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:35.090
And it's the exact
same punchline by now.

00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:38.400
This is the depression
gene environment, stress,

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:40.810
figurative,
superimposable with this.

00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:42.860
It's the exact same punchline.

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:47.440
Having the bad version
of monoamine oxidase gene

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:52.280
does not increase your risk of
antisocial violent behavior.

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:54.540
Having the bad
version of the gene

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:59.670
and getting brought up in an
environment with abuse vastly

00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:01.020
increased likelihood.

00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:03.580
And what they showed in
there was the number of times

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:06.150
of major physical
abuse during childhood,

00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:08.110
the more that was
the case, the more

00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:09.700
there was an interaction here.

00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:11.710
Having the good
version growing up

00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:13.640
in a more abusive
setting, yes, it

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:16.210
increases the odds of
antisocial behavior.

00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:17.520
Not a big effect, though.

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:18.970
What do we got here?

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:22.030
Yet another gene
environment interaction.

00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:24.970
By now you should be
utterly unwilling to say

00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:27.430
whether any gene
does anything here

00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:30.470
outside the context of saying,
in what sort of setting,

00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:31.870
with what sort of background?

00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:34.550
Huge interaction here.

00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:38.870
So giving a sense here of where
serotonin is fitting into it.

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:42.490
Next piece of neurochemistry
that's relevany-- and this

00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:44.210
is not a
neurotransmitter, but this

00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:46.150
is a nuerochemical
that occasionally

00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:50.070
gets put into the nervous
system, which is alcohol.

00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:50.660
Alcohol.

00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:54.300
What doe alcohol do
first to neurons on sort

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:55.980
of the nuts and bolts level?

00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:59.930
Is alcohol a mimicker of any
particular neurotransmitter?

00:13:59.930 --> 00:14:00.640
No.

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:03.380
Does alcohol bind to
any particular class

00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:05.220
of neurotransmitter receptor?

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:06.760
No, not that either.

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:11.390
Alcohol seems to have some
remarkably nonspecific effects

00:14:11.390 --> 00:14:13.260
in terms of how cells function.

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:16.120
All one could say at
this point is alcohol

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:18.590
is not equal to--
it's kind of working

00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:20.580
like this neurotransmitter
or that enzyme

00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:22.120
or that-- it's not that clean.

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:25.820
It is a messy drug with lots
of effects in the brain.

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:27.820
So what does alcohol have
to do with aggression?

00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:29.390
Everybody knows
the answer to that,

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:33.100
which is alcohol increases
levels of aggression.

00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:34.240
Everybody knows this.

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:35.830
Everybody knows
this and the guy who

00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:37.490
gets a couple of
drinks under his built

00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:40.270
and is flinging people out
the bar soon afterward.

00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:42.730
Alcohol increases aggression.

00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:46.940
What you find, in fact, is there
is no significant relationship

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:48.000
between the two.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.060
A huge literature
examining this by now.

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:55.770
And what you see instead is
one of our if then contingent

00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:56.860
themes here.

00:14:56.860 --> 00:15:00.420
Over and over you're getting
this sort of thing coming up.

00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:04.170
Alcohol does not cause
people to be aggressive.

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:06.780
Alcohol causes
people who already

00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:10.140
are aggressive to
become more aggressive.

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:13.620
Alcohol causes people who
are unaggressive to become

00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:14.930
more inhibited.

00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:18.150
What alcohol does
is merely magnify

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:20.590
the preexisting
social tendencies.

00:15:20.590 --> 00:15:22.070
This theme over and over again.

00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:25.150
That's exactly what testosterone
was doing two days ago.

00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:28.250
Testosterone does not make
number three ranking rhesus

00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:30.700
monkeys start attacking
number two and number one.

00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:33.830
It makes them absolutely
torture numbers four and five.

00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:36.380
Testosterone does not
create aggression.

00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:40.100
It amplifies preexisting social
patterns [INAUDIBLE] that's

00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:43.830
our remove the testosterone
and aggression doesn't go down

00:15:43.830 --> 00:15:44.830
to 0%.

00:15:44.830 --> 00:15:48.620
Interaction with social
history, same exact theme again.

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:50.820
Alcohol does not
cause aggression.

00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:53.340
It amplifies
aggressiveness in people

00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:56.660
who already are aggressive.

00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:59.690
Along with that, sort of
as a confounding factor,

00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:02.160
we have this problem that
everybody knows that alcohol

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:03.430
makes you more aggressive.

00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:05.420
And what has also
been shown in studies

00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:08.250
is that if you tell
people that you have just

00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:10.160
raised their blood
alcohol levels

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:13.810
infusing in either alcohol
or infusing in saline.

00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:16.120
And what you see is
when people believe

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:18.300
their blood alcohol
levels have risen

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:20.070
they become more aggressive.

00:16:20.070 --> 00:16:21.860
What is alcohol about?

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:26.800
Alcohol allows you to give
voice to those preexisting

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:29.400
social tendencies
towards aggression.

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:33.090
Modifier over and over
again this sort of theme.

00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:35.370
And this has been studied
in all sorts of contexts.

00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:37.370
One really interesting
domain have

00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:39.380
been people who--
anthropologists

00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:42.910
who basically study how
people in different cultures

00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:46.166
learn to get drunk.

00:16:46.166 --> 00:16:47.290
That's kind of interesting.

00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:49.706
That must be an interesting
thing to spend your career on.

00:16:49.706 --> 00:16:50.800
What is this about?

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:53.550
Looking at-- one of the
people who does this work,

00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:57.050
looking at this whole issue
of populations that did not

00:16:57.050 --> 00:16:59.230
have a prior history
of heavy alcohol

00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:03.220
use before some explicit
transitional event.

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:05.450
And what that usually
translates that into

00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:07.540
is Polynesian
islands that did not

00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:10.920
have much alcohol before
they were touched by the West

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:14.980
during World War II with alcohol
brought in heavily after that.

00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:18.270
So the question becomes,
what are people's behaviors

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:20.319
like in these cultures
as they are first

00:17:20.319 --> 00:17:23.440
having a culture of
people drinking to excess?

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:26.210
And the answer is, it depends.

00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:29.600
It depends on the people who
are teaching you to drink.

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:31.520
And what you see
is an interaction

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:34.570
between the type
of colonial power

00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:37.640
that controlled the island at
the time and what people did.

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:40.590
And you would see in
British controlled islands,

00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:42.640
American controlled
islands, people

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:44.330
would start
realizing that you're

00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:47.650
supposed to be aggressive and
become more violent when you're

00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:48.370
drunk.

00:17:48.370 --> 00:17:51.782
Meanwhile, over in like French
Tahiti, people get drunk

00:17:51.782 --> 00:17:53.240
and they all sleep
with each other.

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:53.740
Aha.

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:54.700
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:57.780
It's a cultural context
specific sort of thing.

00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:00.770
This shown over and over again.

00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:02.830
So a little bit on the
neurochemistry here.

00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:05.370
We then began
working our way left,

00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:08.280
looking first at
hormonal regulation,

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:10.440
the short-term hormonal effects.

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:11.970
Looking at testosterone.

00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:14.830
Let's also briefly
go to the other side

00:18:14.830 --> 00:18:18.530
around that time point, the
acute environmental releasers.

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:21.270
Aggression as our
fixed action pattern.

00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:25.530
What are some of the releasing
stimuli for aggression?

00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:29.310
Some of the most reliable ones
are ones that always, always

00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:32.260
demand you to interview an
animal in the same language

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:36.390
across different species Just as
with sexual behavior releasing

00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:39.970
stimuli, some species become
aggressive in response

00:18:39.970 --> 00:18:45.320
to smells, to sounds, to sights,
to our whole array with this.

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:46.420
Here's one version.

00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:49.860
Here's a species of ant that
gets aggressive in response

00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:51.210
to vibration.

00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:53.080
And these are ants
living in East Africa

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:56.440
that have a symbiotic
relationship with trees there

00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:57.840
acacia trees.

00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:01.730
And what happens is the acacia
trees grow these little sort

00:19:01.730 --> 00:19:06.980
of igloo bubbly spheroid
things on their branches, which

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:09.810
have holes in them and
which provide perfect living

00:19:09.810 --> 00:19:11.340
environments for the ants.

00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:13.700
So acacia trees are
giving ants a home.

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:16.840
And what the ants do in return
is they protect the acacia tree

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:18.210
from herbivores.

00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:19.830
Herbivores eating their leaves.

00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:20.650
What happens?

00:19:20.650 --> 00:19:23.150
Along comes a giraffe
and begins to chew

00:19:23.150 --> 00:19:25.580
and it breaks a branch
and the vibration

00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:28.390
causes all of these
ants to come pouring out

00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:30.430
and bite the giraffe's lips.

00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:32.820
At which point the giraffe
goes to a different tree.

00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:35.500
So we see in that case,
what's the releasing stimulus?

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:37.390
Go and shake a branch
and you suddenly

00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:39.840
have 4,000 ants angry at you.

00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:43.100
All these deals again and
again, interviewing an animal

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:44.470
in its own language.

00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:47.980
So what are some of the reliable
releasing stimuli in humans?

00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:50.370
Same theme as with
the sexual behavior.

00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:53.800
We don't have any auditory
stimuli that automatically

00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:54.870
trigger aggression.

00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:56.760
We don't have any
olfactory ones.

00:19:56.760 --> 00:20:00.040
We don't have any-- we've
got some subliminal ones.

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:02.720
Remember that study
mentioned a few weeks back.

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:05.810
Take sweat from someone
who is frightened

00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:07.440
as opposed to the
same amount of sweat

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:09.820
from someone who's been
happily exercising.

00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:12.520
That was the deal of swabbing
the arm pits of people

00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:14.000
jumping out of airplanes.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.290
Take sweat from someone
who is frightened

00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:20.220
and subliminal exposure to
it, the amygdala activates.

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:22.750
So we're not completely
free of sensory stuff,

00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:25.880
but we're not triggered in
any sort of way that's as

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:27.700
dramatic as in other species.

00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:32.180
So what sort of multi-sensory,
multi-modal sort of things

00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:33.550
trigger aggression?

00:20:33.550 --> 00:20:37.290
Number one, most
reliable one, is pain.

00:20:37.290 --> 00:20:40.500
Make an organism feel
pained and you have greatly

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:43.470
increased its likelihood of
turning around and biting

00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:45.230
the closest thing to it.

00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:48.210
So pain as a trigger for it.

00:20:48.210 --> 00:20:50.560
Frustration as a trigger.

00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:51.930
Take a rat.

00:20:51.930 --> 00:20:54.940
Train it to press a lever
10 times, it gets its food.

00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:56.310
10 times, get its food.

00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:57.930
10 times, it doesn't
get its food.

00:20:57.930 --> 00:21:00.210
10 times, you're not
giving it its food.

00:21:00.210 --> 00:21:01.950
Get the rat good and frustrated.

00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:03.840
And with great
reliability if there

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:05.500
is another rat
sitting there, it's

00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:07.570
going to spin
around and bite it.

00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:11.460
So displacement aggression,
being driven there

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:14.690
by frustration, by pain,
things of that sort.

00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:19.580
And what's really depressing is
if you were a rat or a primate

00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:22.250
and you were sitting there
being frustrated by not getting

00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:24.760
a reward and your
glucocorticoid levels

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:27.270
have risen, go and
bite somebody else

00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:30.640
and your glucocorticoid
levels will go down.

00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:32.980
And there we describe a
very depressing feature

00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:34.330
about our social world.

00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:36.880
Displacing aggression
on somebody else

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:40.350
in species after species
is stress reducing.

00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:41.480
So triggers.

00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:43.110
Triggers for that.

00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:46.630
Great example of this
and a remarkable one,

00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:48.580
back to that business
from a couple of weeks

00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:53.640
ago, that alternative mating
strategy of orangutan males.

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:55.140
That business that
after hearing all

00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:58.700
that heartwarming alternative
strategy stuff of male

00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:01.220
baboons forming
friendships with females.

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:03.910
Meanwhile, the alternative
strategy with a orangutan

00:22:03.910 --> 00:22:07.000
males being something
that absolutely fits

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.850
all the definitions of rape.

00:22:08.850 --> 00:22:10.590
Well, do you see
anything like that

00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:12.540
in some other primate species?

00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:16.620
And you see it every now
and then among male baboons.

00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:20.870
Again, defined as
forced sex with a female

00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:22.580
who actively
attempts to get away

00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:24.540
and actively attempts to resist.

00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:27.060
What you see under
that sort of definition

00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:31.330
is every now and then it
will happen in baboons.

00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:33.050
What is the circumstance?

00:22:33.050 --> 00:22:35.070
I've seen it three
times over the years.

00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:37.370
Other people have seen
it occasionally as well.

00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:39.960
It's always the exact
same circumstance.

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:43.700
It is the number one male
on the day or the day

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:45.710
after that he has
just been dumped out

00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:47.590
of his alpha position.

00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:51.630
And most of the time the animal
goes and mopes somewhere else.

00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:53.650
Most of the time the
animal mopes and then

00:22:53.650 --> 00:22:55.790
finds somebody
smaller to beat up on.

00:22:55.790 --> 00:22:59.170
The only times I've seen this
over all these years, that

00:22:59.170 --> 00:23:01.170
was exactly the circumstance.

00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:04.060
Frustration, aggression
displacement.

00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:06.390
Very, very familiar.

00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:09.110
When we get to some more
environmental factors later on,

00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:12.220
some of the big ones, what we
will deal with in this context

00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:15.180
is the relationship
between why is it

00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:18.030
that when the economy gets
bad, violence goes up.

00:23:18.030 --> 00:23:20.610
Why does poverty breed violence?

00:23:20.610 --> 00:23:22.330
And this is
consistently the case.

00:23:22.330 --> 00:23:24.110
Why is that occurring?

00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:26.700
Some framing theoretically
within the context

00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:30.130
of frustration and
pain and stress

00:23:30.130 --> 00:23:34.400
are really reliable predictors
of aggressive behavior.

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:38.060
But again, it's the same
theme as with alcohol.

00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:40.760
Pain makes organisms
that are already

00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:44.690
predisposed towards being
aggressive more aggressive.

00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:47.810
It does not do so
uniformly across the board.

00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:50.610
Frustration, the
same exact thing.

00:23:50.610 --> 00:23:54.460
Once again, we have something
modulating, amplifying,

00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:57.580
blunting, damping, all
this sort of theme again

00:23:57.580 --> 00:24:00.360
and again, some
other factor there.

00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:01.820
Another example of this.

00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:04.080
Another environmental
trigger-- and study

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:07.806
this subject somewhere in the
1950s or so and the top thing

00:24:07.806 --> 00:24:09.430
that you would get
on the list in terms

00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:12.570
of environmental
releasers for aggression

00:24:12.570 --> 00:24:15.270
would be overcrowding.

00:24:15.270 --> 00:24:18.000
This was a whole literature
that emerged at the time.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.380
A psychologist named
Calhoun, John Calhoun,

00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:21.720
started this whole field.

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:24.260
And what he would do
was take a bunch of rats

00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:28.350
living in an enclosure
of a certain size

00:24:28.350 --> 00:24:30.020
and go about observing them.

00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:32.030
And they're going about
their rat business.

00:24:32.030 --> 00:24:35.250
And now put all of them
into a much smaller space,

00:24:35.250 --> 00:24:37.780
a higher density, crowd them.

00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:41.370
And what he reported
was aggression explodes

00:24:41.370 --> 00:24:42.010
at that point.

00:24:42.010 --> 00:24:44.050
Aggression goes
through the roof.

00:24:44.050 --> 00:24:45.730
Crowding causing aggression.

00:24:45.730 --> 00:24:47.730
The two factoids,
or rather the one

00:24:47.730 --> 00:24:50.790
factoid that everybody
learned from that literature

00:24:50.790 --> 00:24:53.580
for decades afterward from
the Scientific American papers

00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:56.210
was violence would
go up to the point

00:24:56.210 --> 00:24:59.810
that rats would start killing
and cannibalizing each other.

00:24:59.810 --> 00:25:03.660
Urban crowding making our next
generation of cannibals, which

00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:06.240
is exactly what an awful
lot of sociologists

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:08.070
are off running
with, not to mention

00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:09.910
various Southern
senators who talked

00:25:09.910 --> 00:25:13.240
about the menace of inner
city population density

00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:17.360
and spawning violence because
overcrowding causes aggression.

00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:19.680
Whole literature-- and
it took a number of years

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:22.550
until people started
looking a little bit closer

00:25:22.550 --> 00:25:23.690
at the animals.

00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:26.440
And on the average,
the rate of aggression

00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:29.480
does not change with crowding.

00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:32.340
You could probably fill in
the next sentence by now.

00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:34.857
What you see instead
is animals that

00:25:34.857 --> 00:25:36.940
are already aggressive
become more aggressive when

00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:37.565
you crowd them.

00:25:37.565 --> 00:25:39.910
Animals that are
subordinate and unaggressive

00:25:39.910 --> 00:25:42.050
become even more
weak and withdrawn.

00:25:42.050 --> 00:25:44.920
What these early generations
of studies were doing wrong

00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:48.310
was folks sitting there just
looking for the exciting stuff.

00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:49.150
Oh, my God.

00:25:49.150 --> 00:25:51.730
We just saw a rat
cannibalize another one.

00:25:51.730 --> 00:25:54.680
I sure never saw that
with a big enclosure.

00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:57.160
The actual quantitative
rates of aggression

00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:59.030
do not go up with crowding.

00:25:59.030 --> 00:26:02.330
Aggressive individuals
become more aggressive then.

00:26:02.330 --> 00:26:05.420
And we readily can fit
that into scenarios

00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:10.260
of frustration, displacement,
and that kind of thing.

00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:13.030
Now switching back to where
we started the other day,

00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:14.340
back to hormones.

00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:16.660
The short-term
hormonal exposure.

00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:19.330
And where we had
started with short-term

00:26:19.330 --> 00:26:21.390
not the hormonal
exposure back when

00:26:21.390 --> 00:26:23.530
you were a fetus, but
in the last minute,

00:26:23.530 --> 00:26:25.700
in the last hour, the
last couple of days.

00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:29.080
Where we started, of
course, was testosterone.

00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:31.020
And to summarize
that again, it is

00:26:31.020 --> 00:26:33.830
the same punchline as with
testosterone and sexual

00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:34.710
behavior.

00:26:34.710 --> 00:26:38.250
Testosterone is required
for the normal range

00:26:38.250 --> 00:26:41.260
of aggressive behavior in
every species looked at.

00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:45.580
When you castrate males,
levels of aggression go down.

00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:50.370
Just as critically levels of
aggression do not go down to 0.

00:26:50.370 --> 00:26:53.550
Very critically there, the
more prior social experience

00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:57.420
with aggression the more it is
maintained after castration.

00:26:57.420 --> 00:27:02.570
Replace the testosterone, 10%
of normal levels, 100%, 200%.

00:27:02.570 --> 00:27:04.880
All of them do the
exact same thing.

00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:07.530
The brain is sensitive
to testosterone,

00:27:07.530 --> 00:27:11.330
but it's not sensitive to
small little differences in it.

00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:14.850
So no individual who is more
aggressive than the person

00:27:14.850 --> 00:27:17.310
sitting next to
them, there is no way

00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:19.920
it can ever be
attributed to differences

00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:23.620
in testosterone levels in
the normal healthy range.

00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:26.970
Back to the same qualifier
from the sex lectures.

00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:30.900
Now take someone who instead of
having 200% the normal levels,

00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:34.160
twice the normal levels, they
have tenfold higher levels,

00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:37.110
higher than the body
ever normally sees

00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:39.950
because they are abusing
anabolic steroids

00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:43.210
and their levels of
aggression do indeed go up.

00:27:43.210 --> 00:27:45.190
But within the normal
range, you gotta

00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:47.950
have testosterone but
it is necessary but not

00:27:47.950 --> 00:27:49.240
sufficient for normal levels.

00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:52.080
The brain is not sensitive
to small little differences

00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:55.500
and it is overwhelmingly
modulatory.

00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:57.030
That same business again.

00:27:57.030 --> 00:27:59.200
Number three in the
hierarchy stoked

00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:01.910
on testosterone attacks
four and five more,

00:28:01.910 --> 00:28:03.680
doesn't bother with two and one.

00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:06.320
Exaggerating
preexisting tendencies.

00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:09.190
Testosterone is
shortening the lag time

00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:11.590
between action potentials
in the amygdala

00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:15.750
if and only if the
amygdala has gotten excited

00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:17.830
and, passing on
aggressive messages,

00:28:17.830 --> 00:28:20.610
testosterone amplifies
it, testosterone

00:28:20.610 --> 00:28:24.810
not as causing but as
modulating that same theme again

00:28:24.810 --> 00:28:26.016
and again.

00:28:26.016 --> 00:28:27.390
Finally, towards
the end of that,

00:28:27.390 --> 00:28:30.490
we heard about that in amazing
example of hyenas and their sex

00:28:30.490 --> 00:28:31.870
reversal system.

00:28:31.870 --> 00:28:35.080
One final interesting
feature of it, which is we

00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:38.480
live within 30 miles of
the world's only research

00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:41.450
colony of hyenas who live
up in the Berkeley hills.

00:28:41.450 --> 00:28:43.600
And if the wind
is just right, you

00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:45.620
can hear them whooping
in downtown Berkeley

00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:46.680
at night on occasion.

00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:50.251
And God knows how many religions
that has spawned over there.

00:28:50.251 --> 00:28:50.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:52.870
But they've got this
hyena colony there.

00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:56.390
And these were hyenas that were
brought over as pups from East

00:28:56.390 --> 00:28:59.800
Africa, from Kenya, as part
of studying this weird sex

00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:01.220
reversal system.

00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:03.630
Hyenas turn out to be
models for a whole bunch

00:29:03.630 --> 00:29:05.960
of gynecological
disorders having

00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:07.960
to do with the elevated
testosterone levels

00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:08.810
in the females.

00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:11.220
All of that-- they've now
gone through about 20 years

00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:14.110
in generations, but the
very first generation

00:29:14.110 --> 00:29:16.800
they had raised
a critical issue.

00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:19.810
Back to the other day,
hyenas' social systems,

00:29:19.810 --> 00:29:21.840
females are dominant to males.

00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:23.740
Females are more
aggressive than males.

00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:26.250
Females have higher
testosterone levels.

00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:28.790
So the question becomes,
you've got a whole bunch

00:29:28.790 --> 00:29:33.490
of hyenas that were brought over
as pups raised without mothers,

00:29:33.490 --> 00:29:37.070
raised in something
other than a normal hyena

00:29:37.070 --> 00:29:38.940
clan of watching adults.

00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:42.660
They're all growing up as pups
together without adult models.

00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:44.900
Are females going
to still wind up

00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:47.120
being more aggressive
than males?

00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:50.290
And what they saw
was, yes, indeed.

00:29:50.290 --> 00:29:53.990
Females had the same normal
higher testosterone levels

00:29:53.990 --> 00:29:56.670
as you would find in wild
hyenas, the same weirdo

00:29:56.670 --> 00:29:57.950
genitals, all of that.

00:29:57.950 --> 00:30:00.580
And females were
socially dominant.

00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:01.280
Whoa.

00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:05.200
Hormones and bizarre
fake scrotums is destiny.

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:10.120
But what they saw was it took
years for the dominant system

00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:12.570
to emerge with the
females dominating.

00:30:12.570 --> 00:30:14.150
It took far longer.

00:30:14.150 --> 00:30:17.130
What's that telling us about
normal hyenas out there?

00:30:17.130 --> 00:30:20.550
It's a mixture of you
having lots of testosterone

00:30:20.550 --> 00:30:23.150
on board and its
physiological consequences

00:30:23.150 --> 00:30:26.310
and you getting to
watch Mom terrorizing

00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:27.930
the males in the neighborhood.

00:30:27.930 --> 00:30:30.985
So once again, a combination
between social factors,

00:30:30.985 --> 00:30:32.560
endocrine modulators.

00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:36.800
They eventually got to a classic
female dominated social system.

00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:39.480
It took them a
lot longer though.

00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:45.019
Next hormone, hormones to look
at, estrogen, progesterone.

00:30:45.019 --> 00:30:47.060
Back to, no, we're not
going to look at that yet.

00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:47.720
Hold on.

00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:48.320
Stop.

00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:49.070
All of you.

00:30:49.070 --> 00:30:52.460
Next what we look at are
testosterone levels in females.

00:30:52.460 --> 00:30:53.090
Oh, yes.

00:30:53.090 --> 00:30:53.870
That again.

00:30:53.870 --> 00:30:55.980
Same exact thing as
from the sex lecture,

00:30:55.980 --> 00:30:57.450
substituted from there.

00:30:57.450 --> 00:31:00.340
Females generates certain
levels of testosterone

00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:03.380
of related androgens
from the adrenal gland,

00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:07.420
adrenal androgens, maybe 5%
the levels you see in males.

00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:10.120
And what we saw
last week is female

00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:14.980
proceptive sexual behavior
is dependent on testosterone.

00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:16.840
Same exact deal.

00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:19.200
Take out the
adrenals of a woman,

00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:21.290
testosterone levels
drop down to 0

00:31:21.290 --> 00:31:25.390
at that point and levels of
sexual libido, proceptivity,

00:31:25.390 --> 00:31:26.090
go down.

00:31:26.090 --> 00:31:27.430
Not all the way down.

00:31:27.430 --> 00:31:29.920
Depends on how much prior
social experience, same song

00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:30.630
and dance.

00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:32.980
And same song and dance here.

00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:33.900
Aggression.

00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:36.560
Aggression in females
of various species

00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:39.720
is amplified by the
adrenal androgrens.

00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:42.510
Those low levels castrate.

00:31:42.510 --> 00:31:43.140
Goes down.

00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:44.110
Not all the way down.

00:31:44.110 --> 00:31:45.640
Same exact deal again.

00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:50.390
It is modulatory in females
as well as in males.

00:31:50.390 --> 00:31:53.380
Now leaping to estrogen
and progesterone.

00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:56.310
What's up with them in
terms of aggression?

00:31:56.310 --> 00:31:59.590
And we had first hints of it
from the very first lecture,

00:31:59.590 --> 00:32:02.910
that business that a
disproportionate share

00:32:02.910 --> 00:32:06.150
of female violence is
carried out by women

00:32:06.150 --> 00:32:08.250
in their perimenstrual period.

00:32:08.250 --> 00:32:11.530
The whole notion of
perimenstrual syndrome

00:32:11.530 --> 00:32:13.720
increasing aggression.

00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:15.550
This has been around
for a long time

00:32:15.550 --> 00:32:18.600
and this holds up in
some criminology studies,

00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:20.140
though what you see
here, of course,

00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:23.600
is a gazillion different
ways of interpreting it.

00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:25.930
First possible interpretation.

00:32:25.930 --> 00:32:28.740
All we're looking
at here is culture.

00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:31.680
Culture that decides
that menstruation

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:35.800
is a state that you are
unhygienic and need to be

00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:37.440
separated from everybody else.

00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:40.350
And great novels about
red tents and sort

00:32:40.350 --> 00:32:41.790
of cultural values on it.

00:32:41.790 --> 00:32:44.250
So, of course, behavior
changes dramatically

00:32:44.250 --> 00:32:46.060
at that time with a
peripheralization,

00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:50.860
a stigmatization in culture
after culture blah, blah.

00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:52.820
Cross-cultural argument.

00:32:52.820 --> 00:32:56.690
Then there's a personality
argument that a lot of people

00:32:56.690 --> 00:32:57.190
do.

00:32:57.190 --> 00:32:59.330
Looking at the literature,
the relationship between

00:32:59.330 --> 00:33:02.560
increased aggressiveness around
the perimenstrual period.

00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:04.980
Again, notice I'm not
saying pre-menstrual.

00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:06.820
What the literature
shows is a couple

00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:09.480
of days after just as much
as a couple of days before.

00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:11.090
So perimenstrual.

00:33:11.090 --> 00:33:13.760
Personality differences
explaining that.

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:17.640
Then there are the marvelous
psychodynamic psychoanalysts

00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:19.430
who've been let loose
at that for years.

00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:21.080
And what they come
up with-- this

00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:23.830
is one of the great
ridiculous sound bytes.

00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:27.030
That aggression goes up and
women around the time they

00:33:27.030 --> 00:33:29.650
are menstruating
because this evidence

00:33:29.650 --> 00:33:32.960
that they are fertile but
have gone another cycle

00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:36.670
without getting pregnant
throws them into the conflict--

00:33:36.670 --> 00:33:38.746
the conflict between-- get this.

00:33:38.746 --> 00:33:40.620
This could go on like
a doily in the kitchen.

00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:45.680
The conflict between being
productive and reproductive.

00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:49.120
Oh, should I function in society
or should I be off having

00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:50.990
babies like female hyenas?

00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:52.900
And, oh, that's what it's about.

00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:56.140
It's the deep psychoanalytic
conflict and evidence

00:33:56.140 --> 00:33:58.340
that yet again you have
passed up the chance

00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:00.850
to be a mother and
reproductive so you're

00:34:00.850 --> 00:34:02.260
going to be in a pissy mood.

00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:02.780
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:04.920
So that's a more
psychodynamic theory.

00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:08.639
And that one has been around
in the literature forever.

00:34:08.639 --> 00:34:10.820
But back to the biological one.

00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:11.980
Biological one.

00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:16.429
So what sort of evidence
is it for for that?

00:34:16.429 --> 00:34:17.960
So what we got here?

00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:22.170
Let's switch from our
deal from previously.

00:34:22.170 --> 00:34:25.080
So now we've got
menstruation, day 28 coming

00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:26.290
right in the middle there.

00:34:26.290 --> 00:34:28.489
And let us look at this record.

00:34:28.489 --> 00:34:32.844
Here is a female, someone
who you've been observing.

00:34:32.844 --> 00:34:35.260
And you've been observing, in
fact, for a couple of years.

00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:38.940
And you keep track of any time
they do something aggressive.

00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:42.920
And what you see after you've
got 20 cycles worth of data

00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:48.380
is the likelihood of it
occurring does something

00:34:48.380 --> 00:34:50.770
like that.

00:34:50.770 --> 00:34:53.500
That's the perimenstrual
irritability.

00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:56.000
That's a disproportionate
share of women

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.910
in prison for violent acts.

00:34:57.910 --> 00:34:59.150
That's all of that.

00:34:59.150 --> 00:35:01.190
So what do you make
of it when told

00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:03.510
that this is precisely
the profile you

00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:06.880
see in a female baboon?

00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:09.780
Well, she's probably
not getting bummed out

00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:12.330
every time she menstruates
and wonders whether she really

00:35:12.330 --> 00:35:13.970
should be holding
off having babies

00:35:13.970 --> 00:35:16.240
until she gets to be a
partner in the law firm.

00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:18.960
What you see there is none
of the cultural stuff,

00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:20.640
none of the
pyschodynamic, and none

00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:22.320
of the psychosomatic stuff.

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:24.160
Another realm of explanation.

00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:27.200
You see something close
to the same exact thing

00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:29.730
in female baboons.

00:35:29.730 --> 00:35:31.960
So that, and for
my money, argues

00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:36.700
that there is some major biology
going on there amid possibly

00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:38.510
relevant cultural factors.

00:35:38.510 --> 00:35:41.170
Possibly relevant in
terms of there always

00:35:41.170 --> 00:35:43.730
being an argument in a certain
school of anthropologists

00:35:43.730 --> 00:35:46.010
for some decades
that you don't see

00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:49.670
perimenstrual shifts
in behavior in cultures

00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:54.260
that are more free about bodies
and more sexually uninhibited.

00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:57.480
And presumably this
tells you that something

00:35:57.480 --> 00:35:59.452
about baboons'
sexual inhibitions,

00:35:59.452 --> 00:36:00.910
there's not a whole
lot of evidence

00:36:00.910 --> 00:36:03.480
for that perimenstrual
mood shifts is

00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:06.020
pretty universal
across human cultures.

00:36:06.020 --> 00:36:10.050
And you see the same exact
thing in a female baboon.

00:36:10.050 --> 00:36:14.670
So we've got some biology
going on there for my money.

00:36:14.670 --> 00:36:17.860
None the less, you
don't have only biology

00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:21.360
because there are all sorts
of psychological factors.

00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:24.210
One study showing
things, for example,

00:36:24.210 --> 00:36:28.560
like if you tell a woman that
she is one day before having

00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:29.490
her period.

00:36:29.490 --> 00:36:31.760
And I'm not exactly
sure how this one

00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:34.260
works, let alone the human
subject's permission.

00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:36.930
But this was a study
done some decades ago.

00:36:36.930 --> 00:36:40.530
Women become more irritable.

00:36:40.530 --> 00:36:42.770
So a self-fulfilling component.

00:36:42.770 --> 00:36:46.780
Tell someone that
they are going to have

00:36:46.780 --> 00:36:50.460
their period the next day and
their male significant other

00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:51.565
becomes more irritable.

00:36:51.565 --> 00:36:52.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:52.750 --> 00:36:57.180
Irritability among men who
have significant others, women,

00:36:57.180 --> 00:37:01.420
peaks around the time that
she as menstru-- whoa,

00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:05.940
we've got either some sort of
viral, infectious, intersexual

00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:09.600
thing happening here or we've
got strong components having

00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:11.860
nothing to do with the biology.

00:37:11.860 --> 00:37:14.920
This one, in addition,
studies showing that, yes,

00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:16.940
there is this mood fluctuation.

00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:20.460
On the average there is a
larger fluctuation in mood,

00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:23.790
affect, when you compare
weekend versus week

00:37:23.790 --> 00:37:27.090
day, in particular Friday,
Saturday versus Monday,

00:37:27.090 --> 00:37:27.810
Tuesday.

00:37:27.810 --> 00:37:30.220
Bigger fluctuation
than the mood changes

00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:32.770
you see typically in
women around the time

00:37:32.770 --> 00:37:33.830
of their period.

00:37:33.830 --> 00:37:37.020
So we got some biology here,
but nonetheless there's

00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:39.500
other stuff going on as well.

00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:40.860
So what about the biology?

00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:42.440
One thing that
immediately comes up

00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:45.730
is this issue that, OK,
perimenstrual periods,

00:37:45.730 --> 00:37:49.800
mood shifts there, are not
purely about aggression

00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:51.320
and irritability.

00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:55.000
They are also about depression
and social withdrawal.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:56.910
That's the time of
cycle when women

00:37:56.910 --> 00:38:00.110
are most likely to have
a depressive episode.

00:38:00.110 --> 00:38:02.660
Very, very different
scenario there.

00:38:02.660 --> 00:38:03.800
So what's up with that?

00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:07.460
You begin to get a hint of
this looking at the baboons.

00:38:07.460 --> 00:38:10.300
What you see is
this is the profile

00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:14.400
you would see in a high
ranking female baboon.

00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:18.640
Look at a low ranking female and
there's no particular change.

00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:21.360
Look instead at a
measure of how far

00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:23.650
away she stays
from everyone else

00:38:23.650 --> 00:38:25.680
and it does something like that.

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:28.710
In other words, if you are
a low ranking female baboon,

00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:32.050
you don't have the option to
be irritable to somebody else

00:38:32.050 --> 00:38:33.270
and dump on them.

00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:37.400
You instead become more socially
withdrawn, do less grooming.

00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:41.300
So an interaction between
place and society, all of that.

00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:43.060
So the biology now.

00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:45.380
Estrogen, progesterone.

00:38:45.380 --> 00:38:48.000
Lots of evidence
that their levels

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.570
and in particular their
ratio is critical to what

00:38:51.570 --> 00:38:52.780
is going on here.

00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:55.010
Massive changes in
the levels of both

00:38:55.010 --> 00:38:58.050
of these hormones around
the time of one's period.

00:38:58.050 --> 00:39:00.655
And does not take a
whole lot for the ratios

00:39:00.655 --> 00:39:03.510
thus to become
very, very skewed.

00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:06.130
Back to the advanced
endocrinology stuff,

00:39:06.130 --> 00:39:07.550
the fact that
parts of your brain

00:39:07.550 --> 00:39:08.930
are not just
measuring the levels

00:39:08.930 --> 00:39:12.240
of one hormone or another,
but the ratio of the two.

00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:14.060
That seems to be pertinent.

00:39:14.060 --> 00:39:16.870
What the evidence
suggests is in one subset

00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:19.900
of women with severe
perimenstrual syndrome--

00:39:19.900 --> 00:39:22.220
and that's about 10%
of the population.

00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:25.190
In one subset of those
individuals what seems to be

00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:29.090
the problem is too much
of a drop of progesterone

00:39:29.090 --> 00:39:32.780
around the time of your period.

00:39:32.780 --> 00:39:35.650
So what's the
neurochemistry of that?

00:39:35.650 --> 00:39:37.800
Quick memory from
a few weeks ago.

00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:42.162
What's one of the unlikely
things that progesterone does?

00:39:42.162 --> 00:39:44.140
[INAUDIBLE]

00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:44.760
Yeah.

00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:46.350
The GABA receptor stuff.

00:39:46.350 --> 00:39:50.450
Progesterone-- by way of often
this metabolite, this sort

00:39:50.450 --> 00:39:52.770
of breakdown product
of it-- progesterone

00:39:52.770 --> 00:39:56.040
being able to bind to
the receptor for GABA

00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:59.280
at a minor tranquilizer
binding site

00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:03.780
just like where benzodiazepines
like Valium bind to.

00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:06.910
Progesterone as
decreasing anxiety,

00:40:06.910 --> 00:40:10.110
progesterone as mildly sedative.

00:40:10.110 --> 00:40:11.940
That's one of the
interpretations that's

00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:13.950
given for what a
more than normally

00:40:13.950 --> 00:40:18.030
rapid drop of progesterone
might have to do with PMS.

00:40:18.030 --> 00:40:20.810
Another subgroup of
women appear to have

00:40:20.810 --> 00:40:23.030
an atypically large
drop in levels

00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:28.290
of opioids, endogenous
opioids, around the time here.

00:40:28.290 --> 00:40:31.490
Normally there are
levels of beta endorphin,

00:40:31.490 --> 00:40:35.000
a neurotransmitter slash
hormone with all sorts

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:39.270
of nice effects on mood
and things of that sort.

00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:42.460
And levels tend to go
down around this point.

00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:46.200
A subset of women with severe
PMS where the marker there

00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:49.030
appears to be a
particularly fast drop

00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:52.030
of opioid beta endorphin
levels at the time.

00:40:52.030 --> 00:40:55.390
So just the first bits of
hints of the endocrinology

00:40:55.390 --> 00:40:57.500
of what that is about.

00:40:57.500 --> 00:40:58.900
Final hormones.

00:40:58.900 --> 00:41:03.580
Final hormones, glucocorticoids,
epinephrine, norepinephrine,

00:41:03.580 --> 00:41:05.870
glucocorticoids,
sympathetic nervous system.

00:41:05.870 --> 00:41:09.050
And it's the same exact
deal as two days ago.

00:41:09.050 --> 00:41:11.650
Looking at the fact
that those midbrain,

00:41:11.650 --> 00:41:15.117
hindbrain areas get activated
during an aggressive act.

00:41:15.117 --> 00:41:17.200
Oh, does that teach us
something about aggression?

00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:18.620
Not in the slightest.

00:41:18.620 --> 00:41:21.350
What you have instead
is the nonspecificity.

00:41:21.350 --> 00:41:24.920
Levels of glucocorticoids
will go up roughly equally

00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:27.830
whether you were running for
your life or running in rage

00:41:27.830 --> 00:41:29.110
or running in joy.

00:41:29.110 --> 00:41:32.020
That whole deal again,
sympathetic arousal.

00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:33.340
It's nonspecific.

00:41:33.340 --> 00:41:35.960
And back to that sound
byte from two days ago,

00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:38.220
the opposite of
love is not hate.

00:41:38.220 --> 00:41:41.250
The opposite of love
is indifference.

00:41:41.250 --> 00:41:45.120
And endocrinologically,
this is the case again.

00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:48.350
One interesting piece in the
glucocorticoid and sympathetic

00:41:48.350 --> 00:41:50.010
nervous system domain.

00:41:50.010 --> 00:41:53.820
Take somebody and poke
their finger with a pin

00:41:53.820 --> 00:41:56.460
or make them physically
uncomfortable

00:41:56.460 --> 00:41:58.960
or something painful
and they activate

00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:03.041
the sympathetic nervous system
as part of their mild stress

00:42:03.041 --> 00:42:03.540
response.

00:42:03.540 --> 00:42:05.140
The early stages of it.

00:42:05.140 --> 00:42:08.920
One class of people where this
doesn't work anywhere near

00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:11.340
as much-- sociopaths.

00:42:11.340 --> 00:42:14.890
And by now a large literature
showing elevated pain

00:42:14.890 --> 00:42:19.260
thresholds in people with
sociopathic violent disorders

00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:21.940
of behavior, elevated
pain thresholds

00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:26.600
and less sympathetic nervous
system responsiveness to pain.

00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:29.230
And you should be able to
go off and running with that

00:42:29.230 --> 00:42:32.430
one easily in so far
as metaphorically

00:42:32.430 --> 00:42:36.040
what empathy is about, is
feeling somebody else's pain.

00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:39.540
If your own pain system is on
the pretty insensitive side,

00:42:39.540 --> 00:42:41.980
that is certainly going
to have an impact there.

00:42:41.980 --> 00:42:45.010
That's a very
consistent finding.

00:42:45.010 --> 00:42:47.360
So what we are ready for
now is switching over

00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:51.300
to longer term environmental
ideas about aggression.

00:42:51.300 --> 00:42:54.231
Why do I keep pretending
as if the chart is here?

00:42:54.231 --> 00:42:54.730
Here.

00:42:54.730 --> 00:42:56.360
We've now moved over to here.

00:42:56.360 --> 00:42:58.890
Shifting from
environmental triggers--

00:42:58.890 --> 00:43:01.840
not something painful
five seconds ago,

00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:04.780
not I was expecting you get
this food pellet after pressing

00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:08.140
the lever 20 times and I didn't
get the lever, I'm frustrated.

00:43:08.140 --> 00:43:11.410
Not a minute's worth of
environmental releasers.

00:43:11.410 --> 00:43:15.620
But instead general
pictures of what environment

00:43:15.620 --> 00:43:17.010
has to do with aggression.

00:43:17.010 --> 00:43:21.019
Some of the broad theories that
have come out over the years.

00:43:21.019 --> 00:43:22.810
Let's take a five minute
break before that.

00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:28.580
To quickly go through
this deal again.

00:43:28.580 --> 00:43:32.005
So you've got amino
acid precursor.

00:43:32.005 --> 00:43:36.160
Tryptophan, that's your building
block for making serotonin.

00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:39.610
Key enzyme coded for by a gene.

00:43:39.610 --> 00:43:40.690
It's a protein.

00:43:40.690 --> 00:43:43.410
Key enzyme that turns
it into the first step.

00:43:43.410 --> 00:43:44.404
And then this enzyme.

00:43:44.404 --> 00:43:45.570
There's always a ton around.

00:43:45.570 --> 00:43:48.140
It automatically gets
turned into serotonin.

00:43:48.140 --> 00:43:49.750
So now you have serotonin.

00:43:49.750 --> 00:43:53.700
Serotonin will do its thing
by way of binding to serotonin

00:43:53.700 --> 00:43:54.720
receptors.

00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:57.730
And at some point serotonin
tone will be broken down

00:43:57.730 --> 00:43:59.870
into this waste product.

00:43:59.870 --> 00:44:02.680
So a gene coding
for this protein,

00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:05.970
a gene coding for this one,
which we're not interested in.

00:44:05.970 --> 00:44:09.150
A bunch of genes coding
for the receptors.

00:44:09.150 --> 00:44:11.880
And genes coding for
these two enzymes.

00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:13.860
And the whole point
there being that there's

00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:16.540
different versions
of these genes

00:44:16.540 --> 00:44:20.290
for the synthetic enzymes,
for the degradative enzymes,

00:44:20.290 --> 00:44:21.560
for the receptors.

00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:24.250
And thus beginning to
look at whether that

00:44:24.250 --> 00:44:28.120
predicts differences in
levels of aggressive behavior.

00:44:28.120 --> 00:44:30.340
So that's what that was about.

00:44:30.340 --> 00:44:33.950
In addition, was just told
a great story about somebody

00:44:33.950 --> 00:44:37.090
who was under tremendous
duress to supply

00:44:37.090 --> 00:44:40.700
alcohol for her younger
16-year-old sister

00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:44.330
and friends at a sweet
16 party and decided,

00:44:44.330 --> 00:44:46.010
no way is this happening.

00:44:46.010 --> 00:44:49.170
And thus bought a bunch of
bottles of something or other

00:44:49.170 --> 00:44:51.890
and took the labels off
and put other labels on.

00:44:51.890 --> 00:44:53.960
And before you knew it,
you had a whole bunch

00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:57.350
of 16-year-olds
acting just asinine

00:44:57.350 --> 00:44:59.580
and claiming to be
drunk beyond words.

00:44:59.580 --> 00:45:00.890
And, yes.

00:45:00.890 --> 00:45:02.360
Social modulation of.

00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:03.110
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:03.110 --> 00:45:05.100
Very, very frequently seen.

00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:08.620
And hopefully some of you
have taken part in experiments

00:45:08.620 --> 00:45:10.360
like that yourselves
over the years

00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:14.110
or may foist that one
off on someone else.

00:45:14.110 --> 00:45:17.820
So now pushing over toward
some of the broad theories

00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:20.960
about environmental
triggers for aggression.

00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:24.220
And no surprise, theories
are a dime a dozen.

00:45:24.220 --> 00:45:26.560
All sorts of theorists
over the years.

00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:29.630
And some of which occasionally
feel obliged to actually go

00:45:29.630 --> 00:45:31.350
see if there's
data supporting it.

00:45:31.350 --> 00:45:32.850
But what I'll just
touch on briefly

00:45:32.850 --> 00:45:35.970
are three very broadly
different schools

00:45:35.970 --> 00:45:39.700
of thinking about environmental
factors in aggression.

00:45:39.700 --> 00:45:43.460
The first school is one that
says environment is irrelevant.

00:45:43.460 --> 00:45:45.640
And you can bet how much
I'm going to like that here

00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:46.710
in the coming minutes.

00:45:46.710 --> 00:45:49.170
And who was the main
advocate of that?

00:45:49.170 --> 00:45:53.670
Our ever reliable friend
Herr Nazi Konrad Lorenz.

00:45:53.670 --> 00:45:57.400
Konrad Lorenz, after he had
gotten out of his prison camp

00:45:57.400 --> 00:45:59.980
after World War II for
being a Nazi propagandist

00:45:59.980 --> 00:46:03.060
and he sort of dusted himself
off and got his ethology

00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:05.740
empire going again
and remarkably

00:46:05.740 --> 00:46:09.750
was forgiven by the other
elder fathers of ethology,

00:46:09.750 --> 00:46:12.790
including Niko Tinbergen,
who spent much of World War

00:46:12.790 --> 00:46:14.560
II in a concentration
camp and he

00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:16.740
is the one who led
the move to make sure

00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:19.950
that Konrad Lorenz was
welcomed back in the community

00:46:19.950 --> 00:46:22.290
even though he was an
unrepentant Nazi swine.

00:46:22.290 --> 00:46:25.440
But-- so after Konrad
Lorenz came out,

00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:27.560
in the early '60s he
wrote a book which

00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:32.070
was one of the most influential
anthropology books of all time,

00:46:32.070 --> 00:46:34.520
a book called On Aggression.

00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:38.430
And that was the coffee
table book for half a decade.

00:46:38.430 --> 00:46:41.890
That was the book that people
had book clubs about if they

00:46:41.890 --> 00:46:42.990
were intellectuals.

00:46:42.990 --> 00:46:46.920
On Aggression had a huge
influence on people's thinking

00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:48.450
at the time.

00:46:48.450 --> 00:46:51.300
And what was the Lorenz's
basic premise as to

00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:53.940
what were the environmental
components of aggression?

00:46:53.940 --> 00:46:55.300
What was aggression about?

00:46:55.300 --> 00:46:57.130
It was exactly
the book you would

00:46:57.130 --> 00:47:00.230
expect to be written
by an unrepentant Nazi.

00:47:00.230 --> 00:47:05.590
Because his theme was just
following biological orders.

00:47:05.590 --> 00:47:09.540
In Lorenz's view, on his view
as to what aggression is about,

00:47:09.540 --> 00:47:11.190
it is inevitable.

00:47:11.190 --> 00:47:13.880
There is no environmental
requirement.

00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:17.240
Aggression is universal
and inevitable.

00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:20.080
Famous quote of his that
he gave, for example,

00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:23.060
near his death in the
1970s to Newsweek.

00:47:23.060 --> 00:47:25.800
There is no love without hate.

00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:26.530
Wow.

00:47:26.530 --> 00:47:28.021
He must have been
a great father.

00:47:28.021 --> 00:47:28.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:32.390
But what you see is a whole
book, a whole premise,

00:47:32.390 --> 00:47:33.030
built on that.

00:47:33.030 --> 00:47:35.290
A number of the notions,
the basic themes

00:47:35.290 --> 00:47:36.840
that ran through the book.

00:47:36.840 --> 00:47:40.450
Number one, aggression
is universal.

00:47:40.450 --> 00:47:43.440
It is there in all individuals.

00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:47.990
Number two, what he called his
hydraulic model of aggression.

00:47:47.990 --> 00:47:50.090
And if this sounds silly,
you should actually

00:47:50.090 --> 00:47:53.850
go see the book because he had
actual diagrams of like pseudo

00:47:53.850 --> 00:47:57.220
toilet bowl plumbing stuff
telling us how aggression

00:47:57.220 --> 00:47:58.880
works as follows.

00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:04.190
There is some aggression toilet
bowl water tank which is slowly

00:48:04.190 --> 00:48:06.030
filling up with water.

00:48:06.030 --> 00:48:09.360
And the deal is that the
higher the levels of water get,

00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:12.520
the higher the aggressive
drive, the less

00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:16.940
of an environmental trigger it
takes to provoke the aggression

00:48:16.940 --> 00:48:18.560
to come out.

00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:22.040
The higher the levels,
the more easily

00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:24.580
a releasing stimulus
will trigger fixed action

00:48:24.580 --> 00:48:26.280
pattern of aggression.

00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:29.320
Intrinsic in his model
also and explicitly stated

00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:34.240
was eventually his toilet bowl
fills up with enough-- actually

00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:35.990
it's not the toilet
bowl, it's the tank.

00:48:35.990 --> 00:48:37.730
The tank fills up
with enough water

00:48:37.730 --> 00:48:40.180
that it begins to
dribble over the top

00:48:40.180 --> 00:48:43.500
and thus you get
spontaneous aggression.

00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:46.440
His model was with
the passage of time,

00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:50.460
the longer It has been since an
organism has been aggressive,

00:48:50.460 --> 00:48:52.620
the less of an
environmental releaser

00:48:52.620 --> 00:48:55.530
is needed to provoke
the aggression until it

00:48:55.530 --> 00:48:57.940
is ultimately spontaneous.

00:48:57.940 --> 00:49:02.080
The third piece of his model
was just like a toilet bowl

00:49:02.080 --> 00:49:05.610
again, which is when you have
an aggressive act you've just

00:49:05.610 --> 00:49:07.190
emptied out the tank.

00:49:07.190 --> 00:49:10.190
You deplete the
aggressive drive.

00:49:10.190 --> 00:49:13.440
You deplete it so that
it resets the system,

00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:15.510
starting a refractory period.

00:49:15.510 --> 00:49:18.080
That aggression
decreases the likelihood

00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:20.510
of aggression occurring
immediately afterward.

00:49:20.510 --> 00:49:22.240
This was the
Lorentzian model, which

00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:25.270
was enormously,
enormously influential

00:49:25.270 --> 00:49:27.420
and everybody learned
about this in Intro Anthro

00:49:27.420 --> 00:49:30.470
through the 1960s. '60s
And it would take you

00:49:30.470 --> 00:49:33.650
about two seconds
to shred this one.

00:49:33.650 --> 00:49:36.120
How many of you have
ever murdered anyone?

00:49:39.330 --> 00:49:39.980
You never know.

00:49:39.980 --> 00:49:41.980
People are kind of drowsy,
checking their emails

00:49:41.980 --> 00:49:43.220
and suddenly confess.

00:49:43.220 --> 00:49:45.940
How many of you plan
to murder somebody?

00:49:45.940 --> 00:49:48.930
Yes, we are like the most
dangerous aggressively species

00:49:48.930 --> 00:49:51.630
on this planet and the
vast majority of us

00:49:51.630 --> 00:49:53.970
will never have a physical
fight with somebody

00:49:53.970 --> 00:49:56.180
since we left
seventh grade or so.

00:49:56.180 --> 00:49:58.410
Aggression is not universal.

00:49:58.410 --> 00:50:00.720
Aggression is not inevitable.

00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:05.350
And aggression is not sublimated
into psychological processes,

00:50:05.350 --> 00:50:08.090
which thus can pass as
support for this model.

00:50:08.090 --> 00:50:10.690
The final thing that
does it in is aggression

00:50:10.690 --> 00:50:12.870
is not self-depleting.

00:50:12.870 --> 00:50:15.530
Aggression is self-reinforcing.

00:50:15.530 --> 00:50:18.110
And all you have to do
is look at the crowd

00:50:18.110 --> 00:50:20.300
contagion, the
emotional contagion,

00:50:20.300 --> 00:50:24.020
that occurs in soccer stadiums
when people start fighting.

00:50:24.020 --> 00:50:25.920
Crowd violence, all of that.

00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:29.850
Aggression is not self-depleting
and resetting the clock.

00:50:29.850 --> 00:50:32.660
Aggression stimulates
more aggression.

00:50:32.660 --> 00:50:35.110
Aggression legitimatizes it.

00:50:35.110 --> 00:50:37.160
It habituates you to it it.

00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:39.620
Is not fitting
Lorenz's model at all.

00:50:39.620 --> 00:50:41.830
Meanwhile, on the
other end of the block,

00:50:41.830 --> 00:50:44.240
was a very, very
different sort of view.

00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:47.210
And this is one that permeates
a lot of thinking in the field.

00:50:47.210 --> 00:50:49.300
And this is one built
around the notion

00:50:49.300 --> 00:50:53.310
that aggression is ultimately
all about frustration.

00:50:53.310 --> 00:50:59.600
It is about frustration,
pain, stress, fear, anxiety.

00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:01.660
And this was a view
very heavily pushed

00:51:01.660 --> 00:51:05.210
by Soviet researchers in the
period of the Soviet Union.

00:51:05.210 --> 00:51:07.670
A very Marxist view
because essentially

00:51:07.670 --> 00:51:09.820
what you conclude at
the end is this theme

00:51:09.820 --> 00:51:12.090
I keep bringing up
every time pointing out

00:51:12.090 --> 00:51:15.470
that the amygdala has something
to do with both aggression

00:51:15.470 --> 00:51:16.580
and fear.

00:51:16.580 --> 00:51:19.250
That in a world in which
no amygdaloid neuron

00:51:19.250 --> 00:51:21.810
need have an action
potential out of fear,

00:51:21.810 --> 00:51:23.500
there's not going
to be aggression.

00:51:23.500 --> 00:51:27.490
So this is the extreme version
of the frustration displacement

00:51:27.490 --> 00:51:28.180
model.

00:51:28.180 --> 00:51:31.770
And what is emphasized
in that is a lot of data.

00:51:31.770 --> 00:51:36.590
You look at, for example, when
levels of unemployment go up,

00:51:36.590 --> 00:51:40.330
levels of spousal abuse go up,
levels of child abuse go up.

00:51:40.330 --> 00:51:43.860
When the economy gets
bad, the same exact thing.

00:51:43.860 --> 00:51:45.200
Laboratory animals.

00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:47.810
Shock a rat, it will bite
the one sitting next to it.

00:51:47.810 --> 00:51:51.450
All of these versions of
displacement aggression.

00:51:51.450 --> 00:51:56.030
In a baboon troop, for example,
almost 50% of aggression

00:51:56.030 --> 00:52:00.020
is displacement aggression
after somebody loses a fight

00:52:00.020 --> 00:52:02.340
or loses access to a resource.

00:52:02.340 --> 00:52:04.980
Almost certainly this
begins to explain

00:52:04.980 --> 00:52:09.780
two really, really depressing
things about unequal societies.

00:52:09.780 --> 00:52:13.940
First one being that the
poorer you are, the more likely

00:52:13.940 --> 00:52:16.140
you are to be violent,
the more likely

00:52:16.140 --> 00:52:18.810
you are to commit some
sort of criminal violence.

00:52:18.810 --> 00:52:21.690
And when the economy gets bad,
the rates of that get worse.

00:52:21.690 --> 00:52:22.880
It gets more skewed.

00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:25.380
And the other ironic
piece of all of that

00:52:25.380 --> 00:52:32.060
is that when crime goes up in
lower socioeconomic strata,

00:52:32.060 --> 00:52:36.160
overwhelmingly it is crime
turned on the other poor.

00:52:36.160 --> 00:52:38.690
When crime goes
up during periods

00:52:38.690 --> 00:52:42.840
of frustration and mistreatment
of lower socioeconomic classes,

00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:45.900
it does not take the form
of suddenly everybody going

00:52:45.900 --> 00:52:48.930
and deciding to like scale
the wall to the palace there

00:52:48.930 --> 00:52:51.300
and rip off some
of the Ming vases.

00:52:51.300 --> 00:52:54.130
It is victimizing the
people who are victims

00:52:54.130 --> 00:52:55.600
right next door to you.

00:52:55.600 --> 00:52:57.930
During times of
economic downturns,

00:52:57.930 --> 00:53:00.810
the rates of crime in
poorer neighborhoods go up

00:53:00.810 --> 00:53:03.640
and it's almost always
turned on individuals

00:53:03.640 --> 00:53:04.900
in the neighborhood.

00:53:04.900 --> 00:53:07.510
So that supports
this picture as well.

00:53:07.510 --> 00:53:10.980
One interesting thing that
argues against frustration

00:53:10.980 --> 00:53:12.390
displacement models.

00:53:12.390 --> 00:53:13.950
And this is looking at animals.

00:53:13.950 --> 00:53:17.140
And looking at what happens
to levels of aggression

00:53:17.140 --> 00:53:19.430
during periods of famine.

00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:22.400
And this has been studied in a
surprising number of species.

00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:26.600
And what you've got are two
very opposing predictions.

00:53:26.600 --> 00:53:30.720
First one is if what aggression
is about is built out

00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:36.480
of frustration, need pain, fear,
hunger, things of that sort,

00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:40.040
the prediction would be when you
look at populations of animals

00:53:40.040 --> 00:53:42.350
during periods of
famine, aggression

00:53:42.350 --> 00:53:45.370
should go up over
food resources.

00:53:45.370 --> 00:53:46.960
And this comes
with the qualifier

00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:49.730
that these studies have
to be during a period when

00:53:49.730 --> 00:53:52.000
animals are having
to work harder

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:54.040
to get the normal
amounts of food

00:53:54.040 --> 00:53:56.760
rather than that they are
being calorically deprived

00:53:56.760 --> 00:53:59.140
because obviously behavior
is going to be changed then.

00:53:59.140 --> 00:54:00.950
So frustration
displacement model

00:54:00.950 --> 00:54:03.710
predicts that during
periods of famine,

00:54:03.710 --> 00:54:07.180
aggression goes up
in social species.

00:54:07.180 --> 00:54:10.380
A very different model would
predict exactly the opposite.

00:54:10.380 --> 00:54:12.430
And what the bulk of
the literature has shown

00:54:12.430 --> 00:54:17.240
is during periods of famine in
wild animals in social groups,

00:54:17.240 --> 00:54:20.700
aggression tends to go
down rather than up.

00:54:20.700 --> 00:54:22.600
So at least in that
realm that tends

00:54:22.600 --> 00:54:26.480
to be a vote against one
particular type of frustration

00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:28.130
displacement aggression.

00:54:28.130 --> 00:54:29.310
It tends to go down.

00:54:29.310 --> 00:54:31.850
And in fact, the term has
been given for that by people

00:54:31.850 --> 00:54:33.150
who think about these things.

00:54:33.150 --> 00:54:36.200
It's referred to
as behavioral fat.

00:54:36.200 --> 00:54:40.580
Why does aggression go up, for
example, among young male lions

00:54:40.580 --> 00:54:43.110
not during the periods of
the year when there is not

00:54:43.110 --> 00:54:46.610
much food but during the peak
of, say, zebra migration?

00:54:46.610 --> 00:54:48.040
What's going on there?

00:54:48.040 --> 00:54:48.860
You've got a lion.

00:54:48.860 --> 00:54:51.190
It's sitting there
saying, I'm not hungry.

00:54:51.190 --> 00:54:52.220
My stomach is full.

00:54:52.220 --> 00:54:53.402
There's nobody to hunt.

00:54:53.402 --> 00:54:55.110
Nobody's going to mate
with me right now,

00:54:55.110 --> 00:54:57.510
so I might as well go get
in a fight with somebody.

00:54:57.510 --> 00:55:00.790
And in that scenario
what aggression is about

00:55:00.790 --> 00:55:05.020
is use of surplus resources
when there is an excess.

00:55:05.020 --> 00:55:06.890
It is behavioral fat.

00:55:06.890 --> 00:55:09.690
And in lots of species
you see aggression

00:55:09.690 --> 00:55:12.430
as a model of behavioral
fat rather than

00:55:12.430 --> 00:55:15.620
purely resource deprivation.

00:55:15.620 --> 00:55:17.430
One interesting
interpretation that I've

00:55:17.430 --> 00:55:20.320
seen of one type of
violence, which is the notion

00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:23.300
that violence,
aggression, competition,

00:55:23.300 --> 00:55:26.800
being built around limited
resources, a very interesting

00:55:26.800 --> 00:55:32.410
interpretation of clan violence,
of feuds, of vendettas,

00:55:32.410 --> 00:55:35.270
of retributive violence, which
has been a large percentage

00:55:35.270 --> 00:55:37.010
of violence over the centuries.

00:55:37.010 --> 00:55:39.670
A way to formalize
that is to think

00:55:39.670 --> 00:55:42.020
that these are two
different clans at war

00:55:42.020 --> 00:55:45.240
with each other competing
for a very, very

00:55:45.240 --> 00:55:48.280
singular resource,
the one who does

00:55:48.280 --> 00:55:50.290
the last bit of retribution.

00:55:50.290 --> 00:55:52.040
That's what they're
competing for.

00:55:52.040 --> 00:55:54.080
So an interesting
interpretation there.

00:55:54.080 --> 00:55:56.230
Third broad branch
of people thinking

00:55:56.230 --> 00:55:58.660
about theorizing about
aggression-- and these are,

00:55:58.660 --> 00:56:00.590
of course, our behaviorists.

00:56:00.590 --> 00:56:03.870
Back to the Watson and
Skinner and give me

00:56:03.870 --> 00:56:05.860
a child of any
background and let

00:56:05.860 --> 00:56:09.774
me control rewards and positive
reinforcement and punishments

00:56:09.774 --> 00:56:11.440
and negative
reinforcement, all of that,

00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:14.580
and I will be able to regulate
any aspect of behavior.

00:56:14.580 --> 00:56:16.530
We know that whole
approach by now.

00:56:16.530 --> 00:56:18.120
We saw all the
ways in which that

00:56:18.120 --> 00:56:22.390
fails in explaining classical
ethologically based behavior.

00:56:22.390 --> 00:56:27.100
But in the standard behaviorist
view have enough opportunities

00:56:27.100 --> 00:56:32.500
for punishment and you can
shape, you can condition away,

00:56:32.500 --> 00:56:35.400
you can eliminate
aggressive behavior.

00:56:35.400 --> 00:56:38.550
And all you need to do
is think for two seconds

00:56:38.550 --> 00:56:42.730
and see that that is very
limited in its applicability.

00:56:42.730 --> 00:56:45.390
Nicely, huge number
of experiments

00:56:45.390 --> 00:56:47.820
have been going on for two
centuries in this country

00:56:47.820 --> 00:56:50.960
looking at that, which is
looking at rates of crime

00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:54.910
as levels of punishment, the
length of jail sentences,

00:56:54.910 --> 00:56:57.110
the likelihood of
being caught, things

00:56:57.110 --> 00:56:59.760
like that as the
punishment likelihood

00:56:59.760 --> 00:57:04.070
and severity changes, does that
change the likelihood of crime?

00:57:04.070 --> 00:57:07.980
Most studied is the very
specific question of,

00:57:07.980 --> 00:57:11.550
does the death penalty
decrease the amount of murders?

00:57:11.550 --> 00:57:14.160
As different states have
eliminated the death penalty,

00:57:14.160 --> 00:57:17.140
as they've reinstated
it, things of that sort,

00:57:17.140 --> 00:57:21.050
does changing your behaviorist
realm of punishment

00:57:21.050 --> 00:57:23.000
that you could get
for killing someone,

00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:27.020
does that decrease the
incidence of murders?

00:57:27.020 --> 00:57:31.040
And what you wind up seeing
is in some cases, yes.

00:57:31.040 --> 00:57:32.060
Absolutely.

00:57:32.060 --> 00:57:33.960
When you are looking
at murders that

00:57:33.960 --> 00:57:36.430
involve premeditated violence.

00:57:36.430 --> 00:57:38.580
When it is someone
who is sitting there

00:57:38.580 --> 00:57:40.620
for months planning
how to do this,

00:57:40.620 --> 00:57:43.610
when somebody who is
hired to kill somebody.

00:57:43.610 --> 00:57:44.710
Things of that sort.

00:57:44.710 --> 00:57:47.670
When it is planned in advance,
increased the likelihood

00:57:47.670 --> 00:57:50.830
of death penalty does indeed
decrease the likelihood

00:57:50.830 --> 00:57:52.820
of premeditated murder.

00:57:52.820 --> 00:57:58.010
However, it does not touch for a
second impulsive murder, crimes

00:57:58.010 --> 00:57:59.660
of passion, things of that sort.

00:57:59.660 --> 00:58:01.040
And that makes perfect sense.

00:58:01.040 --> 00:58:04.560
There is no person who has
just been insulted in a bar

00:58:04.560 --> 00:58:07.160
and pulls out a gun
who stops for a second

00:58:07.160 --> 00:58:08.520
and thinks, wait a second.

00:58:08.520 --> 00:58:11.880
Did the state legislature
pass that new law last week?

00:58:11.880 --> 00:58:13.030
Let me think about it.

00:58:13.030 --> 00:58:15.510
They don't think about that
because they don't think.

00:58:15.510 --> 00:58:20.230
And the majority of violence in
that realm is unpremeditated.

00:58:20.230 --> 00:58:22.250
Mostly what the
studies have shown

00:58:22.250 --> 00:58:25.440
is changing the
severity of punishment

00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:29.350
for murder does not particularly
change the murder rates.

00:58:29.350 --> 00:58:32.810
So these broad different
sorts of views-- aggression

00:58:32.810 --> 00:58:36.860
as inevitable, biologically
inevitable, all environment can

00:58:36.860 --> 00:58:39.170
do is shape the frequency a bit.

00:58:39.170 --> 00:58:43.970
Aggression as solely a product
of fear, frustration, anxiety,

00:58:43.970 --> 00:58:45.710
resource deprivation.

00:58:45.710 --> 00:58:48.540
Aggression solely as
a set of behaviors

00:58:48.540 --> 00:58:51.170
that could be shaped by
reward and punishment

00:58:51.170 --> 00:58:52.830
to the point of going away.

00:58:52.830 --> 00:58:54.820
What do you actually
see when you

00:58:54.820 --> 00:58:57.740
see some aspects of
environmental impacts

00:58:57.740 --> 00:58:58.630
on aggression?

00:58:58.630 --> 00:59:01.120
Particularly early in life.

00:59:01.120 --> 00:59:03.070
What do you wind
up seeing in terms

00:59:03.070 --> 00:59:05.730
of learning to be aggressive?

00:59:05.730 --> 00:59:08.060
The theme that comes
through over and over again,

00:59:08.060 --> 00:59:10.470
as I've referred
to, is the notion

00:59:10.470 --> 00:59:12.900
that a lot of what early
experience is about

00:59:12.900 --> 00:59:15.240
is not learning how
to be aggressive,

00:59:15.240 --> 00:59:17.450
but learning when
to be aggressive.

00:59:17.450 --> 00:59:19.790
The appropriate context for it.

00:59:19.790 --> 00:59:20.630
Whoa.

00:59:20.630 --> 00:59:21.789
My page has disappeared.

00:59:21.789 --> 00:59:23.455
No wonder it seemed
to have just jumped.

00:59:26.070 --> 00:59:29.990
Let's just do that
for a moment here.

00:59:29.990 --> 00:59:32.780
Oh, that's what we're
talking about next.

00:59:32.780 --> 00:59:34.540
So let's get rid of that.

00:59:34.540 --> 00:59:37.120
So what that ushers
us into, I say,

00:59:37.120 --> 00:59:40.330
trying to make it seem as if
that's a seamless transition--

00:59:40.330 --> 00:59:42.357
what, OK.

00:59:42.357 --> 00:59:43.940
Let's all sing for
a couple of minutes

00:59:43.940 --> 00:59:45.220
here while I look at
this piece of paper.

00:59:45.220 --> 00:59:45.820
[LAUGHTER]

00:59:45.820 --> 00:59:48.000
So what this now
brings up is, what

00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:50.860
does early experience--
in terms of environment,

00:59:50.860 --> 00:59:52.810
in terms of upbringing--
what does that

00:59:52.810 --> 00:59:56.290
have to do with aggressive
behavior, empathy, compassion,

00:59:56.290 --> 00:59:58.430
all the things we
are looking at here?

00:59:58.430 --> 01:00:00.860
Because never more
than during development

01:00:00.860 --> 01:00:04.210
do these themes of is
aggression inevitable,

01:00:04.210 --> 01:00:06.640
is aggression purely
about social learning,

01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:09.160
is aggression purely
about displacement--

01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:13.260
never more is it clearer in
terms of the consequences

01:00:13.260 --> 01:00:15.340
than during early development.

01:00:15.340 --> 01:00:18.270
So what's the transition
during development

01:00:18.270 --> 01:00:21.040
towards the development
of aggression,

01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:23.780
the development of
empathy, the development

01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:26.370
of compassionate
behavior, cooperation?

01:00:26.370 --> 01:00:27.570
All of that.

01:00:27.570 --> 01:00:29.520
Widely, widely studied.

01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:32.240
Tons of research that's
been done in this area.

01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:35.160
Much of it ultimately
framed along the lines of,

01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:38.140
what is the development
of moral standards?

01:00:38.140 --> 01:00:39.970
Moral development in kids.

01:00:39.970 --> 01:00:42.860
But what's pertinent
comes long before that.

01:00:42.860 --> 01:00:46.350
Very early in life the most
pertinent initial transition

01:00:46.350 --> 01:00:48.750
is when kids start
distinguishing

01:00:48.750 --> 01:00:51.780
between animate and
inanimate objects.

01:00:51.780 --> 01:00:55.550
And that comes remarkably
early during the first few days

01:00:55.550 --> 01:00:56.760
to weeks of life.

01:00:56.760 --> 01:00:59.420
That's a very early transition.

01:00:59.420 --> 01:01:04.040
And as I think we have
heard already, what you see

01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:06.470
is this specialized
region of the brain,

01:01:06.470 --> 01:01:09.680
the fusiform cortex
that responds to faces,

01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:12.660
and the fact that autistic
individuals, that part

01:01:12.660 --> 01:01:16.290
of their brains do not respond
to faces as in everybody else,

01:01:16.290 --> 01:01:20.780
not necessarily distinguishing
between animate and inanimate.

01:01:20.780 --> 01:01:22.920
So initial stage,
first beginning

01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:25.240
to get that dichotomy down.

01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:28.190
What then emerges is
the first evidence

01:01:28.190 --> 01:01:31.440
of kids beginning to
differentiate themselves

01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:33.540
from the world around
them, beginning

01:01:33.540 --> 01:01:35.340
to get a sense of self.

01:01:35.340 --> 01:01:37.550
And this is where
kids begin to get

01:01:37.550 --> 01:01:39.550
ego boundaries of some sort.

01:01:39.550 --> 01:01:43.130
Before that happens,
a kid very typically

01:01:43.130 --> 01:01:46.520
views themselves as basically
being continuous with mom.

01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:50.330
And this is the world where
you see a 12-month-old where

01:01:50.330 --> 01:01:53.270
mom has a cut on her finger
and has been walking around

01:01:53.270 --> 01:01:56.170
with a Band-Aid and the
kid is there all day

01:01:56.170 --> 01:01:58.940
saying that they have
an owie on their finger.

01:01:58.940 --> 01:02:01.880
Because they are
mom, mom is them.

01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:04.310
There is no particular
boundary between them.

01:02:04.310 --> 01:02:06.650
Around a year of age
is when you begin

01:02:06.650 --> 01:02:09.230
to see this starting to happen.

01:02:09.230 --> 01:02:10.820
So a sense of self.

01:02:10.820 --> 01:02:13.410
What that, of course, has
to be a precursor for it

01:02:13.410 --> 01:02:17.211
a sense of others being
selves, theory of mind.

01:02:17.211 --> 01:02:18.960
So we've already heard
the building blocks

01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:20.080
of theory of mind.

01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:23.230
When do kids first
begin to recognize

01:02:23.230 --> 01:02:26.790
that not only are they
a distinct individual,

01:02:26.790 --> 01:02:30.340
but there are other individuals
with different information,

01:02:30.340 --> 01:02:31.800
with different
thoughts, ultimately

01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:33.170
with different feelings?

01:02:33.170 --> 01:02:35.070
And when does that
begin to emerge?

01:02:35.070 --> 01:02:37.250
Typically between
age of three to five.

01:02:37.250 --> 01:02:40.180
And we've already heard some
of the basic sort of tests

01:02:40.180 --> 01:02:41.820
that are done to reveal that.

01:02:41.820 --> 01:02:44.810
And what you also see
is it is very, very

01:02:44.810 --> 01:02:46.490
emotionally contingent.

01:02:46.490 --> 01:02:49.640
Take a kid who is doing
great theory of mind when

01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:53.170
you read them some abstract
story about Sally Mae

01:02:53.170 --> 01:02:55.080
or, who is it?

01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:55.970
Sarah Ann?

01:02:55.970 --> 01:02:57.040
Sally.

01:02:57.040 --> 01:02:58.260
Sally Ann?

01:02:58.260 --> 01:03:01.370
OK, I seem to not be able
to get this one down.

01:03:01.370 --> 01:03:03.430
That kid with the doll there.

01:03:03.430 --> 01:03:05.330
Read them and they
may be at a point

01:03:05.330 --> 01:03:08.450
where they are three, six months
into being able to perfectly do

01:03:08.450 --> 01:03:09.660
tests like that.

01:03:09.660 --> 01:03:12.560
But get them in an emotional
aroused circumstance

01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:14.950
where it's something
they really care about as

01:03:14.950 --> 01:03:18.170
opposed to like some story
there and the theory of mind

01:03:18.170 --> 01:03:19.990
goes down the tubes
at that point.

01:03:19.990 --> 01:03:22.440
It is not an all
or none transition.

01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:25.240
It is one that is
vulnerable, potentially,

01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:26.360
to strong emotions.

01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:28.950
Go figure, not surprising.

01:03:28.950 --> 01:03:31.005
So what a lot of people
have thought about is,

01:03:31.005 --> 01:03:35.610
is theory of mind a
prerequisite for empathy?

01:03:35.610 --> 01:03:39.010
Is it possible to feel
somebody else's pain

01:03:39.010 --> 01:03:42.060
and act upon it
without having a sense

01:03:42.060 --> 01:03:44.420
that there is a
somebody else who has

01:03:44.420 --> 01:03:46.290
different thoughts
and, most importantly,

01:03:46.290 --> 01:03:47.150
different feelings?

01:03:47.150 --> 01:03:49.660
And they can be bad feelings,
things of that sort.

01:03:49.660 --> 01:03:53.910
Is theory of mind a
prerequisite for empathy?

01:03:53.910 --> 01:03:56.520
And the general sense among
a lot of people in the field

01:03:56.520 --> 01:03:57.760
is, yes, indeed.

01:03:57.760 --> 01:04:00.900
It is necessary
but not sufficient.

01:04:00.900 --> 01:04:04.170
And where you see the
most dramatic dissociation

01:04:04.170 --> 01:04:06.570
between theory of
mind and empathy

01:04:06.570 --> 01:04:08.790
is when you look at sociopaths.

01:04:08.790 --> 01:04:11.510
Every sort of test
that could be done,

01:04:11.510 --> 01:04:15.300
sociopaths have spectacular
theories of mind.

01:04:15.300 --> 01:04:18.940
They are incredibly good
at manipulating people.

01:04:18.940 --> 01:04:23.080
And manipulation requires
a very, very astute theory

01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:25.700
of mind to be able to do that.

01:04:25.700 --> 01:04:29.160
Sociopaths have the
prerequisite of theory of mind

01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:31.350
that most people think
that empathy requires.

01:04:31.350 --> 01:04:34.330
But what you have there
is it stops at that point.

01:04:34.330 --> 01:04:35.390
It does not continue.

01:04:35.390 --> 01:04:40.120
It is a means for exploitation
rather than the transition

01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:42.130
into true empathy.

01:04:42.130 --> 01:04:44.120
As we've already heard,
there is evidence

01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:47.730
for empathy like of that sort
and theory of mind in apes,

01:04:47.730 --> 01:04:49.780
so we're not the only ones.

01:04:49.780 --> 01:04:52.320
So general view being
that you don't get empathy

01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:54.000
until you get theory of mind.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.250
But there's always been
this confusing sort

01:04:56.250 --> 01:04:58.870
of counter bit of evidence
where you see stuff

01:04:58.870 --> 01:05:02.890
like the world of a
15-month-old where somebody

01:05:02.890 --> 01:05:04.640
is sitting in the room crying.

01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:07.770
And often in experiments
someone who is pretending to.

01:05:07.770 --> 01:05:09.920
And the 15-month-old
will come up

01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:12.090
and try to give the
paci to the person

01:05:12.090 --> 01:05:13.660
and try to put it
in their mouth.

01:05:13.660 --> 01:05:15.820
Here, feel better.

01:05:15.820 --> 01:05:18.970
So possible
interpretations, number one

01:05:18.970 --> 01:05:22.070
being that this is already
evidence of empathy.

01:05:22.070 --> 01:05:24.880
Empathy not yet having the
theory of mind element of not

01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:27.430
only recognizing there's
somebody else, but not

01:05:27.430 --> 01:05:29.560
everybody likes
pacies, especially mine

01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:31.090
that I've been slobbering on.

01:05:31.090 --> 01:05:35.150
Other interpretation, an
irritation decreasing strategy,

01:05:35.150 --> 01:05:38.040
which is it's simply
distressing having the person

01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:39.930
in there acting all upset.

01:05:39.930 --> 01:05:42.100
And what's going to
make them shut up?

01:05:42.100 --> 01:05:45.640
I know, I'm going to go over
to them and give them my stuffy

01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:46.970
and maybe that will work.

01:05:46.970 --> 01:05:48.790
It is not empathy.

01:05:48.790 --> 01:05:52.170
It is attempts to get away
from this irritating context.

01:05:52.170 --> 01:05:55.930
Studies very interestingly,
though, arguing against that.

01:05:55.930 --> 01:05:59.530
Take kids during their first
three to six months of life

01:05:59.530 --> 01:06:04.040
and show them a scenario where
two people are interacting.

01:06:04.040 --> 01:06:07.510
One of them needs help
and the other helps them.

01:06:07.510 --> 01:06:11.010
Or one of them needs help
and the other doesn't.

01:06:11.010 --> 01:06:13.960
Or one of them has
something and the other one

01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:15.380
takes the thing away from them.

01:06:15.380 --> 01:06:18.140
So either pro-social
behavior, neutral,

01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:19.700
or anti-social behavior.

01:06:19.700 --> 01:06:21.850
And kids in that
age range already

01:06:21.850 --> 01:06:24.730
prefer to look at the
individual who's doing

01:06:24.730 --> 01:06:27.040
the pro-social helpful thing.

01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:31.350
So some sort of elements of
this are already in there

01:06:31.350 --> 01:06:33.280
before formal theory of mind.

01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:37.040
None the less, that seems to
be a big important part of it.

01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:39.770
Next, so you got
yourself theory of mind

01:06:39.770 --> 01:06:42.550
and the next step in there
is not only recognition

01:06:42.550 --> 01:06:44.430
that somebody else
has other thoughts

01:06:44.430 --> 01:06:45.750
but they have other feelings.

01:06:45.750 --> 01:06:47.380
They can be very
different from yours.

01:06:47.380 --> 01:06:48.940
They can be legitimate.

01:06:48.940 --> 01:06:52.410
And what we begin to enter
now is the more formal world

01:06:52.410 --> 01:06:54.470
of moral development in kids.

01:06:54.470 --> 01:06:58.410
And the name, the-- without
question-- the most influential

01:06:58.410 --> 01:07:01.166
psychologist in this whole
field, one of the biggest

01:07:01.166 --> 01:07:03.040
names in the whole field
in the last century,

01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:04.810
this guy Lawrence Kohlberg.

01:07:04.810 --> 01:07:09.650
And Kohlberg's famed stages
of moral development in kids.

01:07:09.650 --> 01:07:13.350
How many of you are
familiar with Kohlberg?

01:07:13.350 --> 01:07:15.741
How many are not?

01:07:15.741 --> 01:07:16.240
Good.

01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:17.560
Kohlberg is.

01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:19.010
So Kohlberg.

01:07:19.010 --> 01:07:21.920
Lawrence Kohlberg was a
psychologist at Harvard,

01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:23.540
super influential.

01:07:23.540 --> 01:07:25.920
And he came out of
tradition established

01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:28.080
by the Swiss psychologist.

01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:30.250
It's never possible to
just say the psychologist.

01:07:30.250 --> 01:07:33.490
You always have to see the
Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget.

01:07:33.490 --> 01:07:35.780
And Piaget brought
in the whole notion

01:07:35.780 --> 01:07:40.460
of sequences of development,
sequences as in kids

01:07:40.460 --> 01:07:42.390
crawl before they walk.

01:07:42.390 --> 01:07:45.920
Kids comprehend language before
they begin to produce it.

01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:49.190
And Piaget generated a
whole world of information

01:07:49.190 --> 01:07:52.370
about stages of
cognitive development.

01:07:52.370 --> 01:07:55.220
At what age do kids
have object permanence?

01:07:55.220 --> 01:07:58.080
You cover something, is
the object still existing

01:07:58.080 --> 01:08:00.850
or do you get all surprised
when you take the lid off

01:08:00.850 --> 01:08:03.460
and it's still there and
start breathing faster?

01:08:03.460 --> 01:08:06.020
Stages of cognitive maturation.

01:08:06.020 --> 01:08:08.080
And Kohlberg came
out of that tradition

01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:11.280
looking instead at
sequential development

01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:14.170
of moral development.

01:08:14.170 --> 01:08:16.520
The theme that ran through
this whole sort of world

01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:19.210
of sequential
whatevers is that you

01:08:19.210 --> 01:08:21.960
don't have the sequence change.

01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:25.109
There are no kids ever who
run before they're crawling.

01:08:25.109 --> 01:08:27.649
There are no kids who are
fluidly producing language

01:08:27.649 --> 01:08:29.090
before they comprehend it.

01:08:29.090 --> 01:08:30.500
It's a set sequence.

01:08:30.500 --> 01:08:32.069
What does experience do?

01:08:32.069 --> 01:08:34.700
It regulates the rate,
the speed with which

01:08:34.700 --> 01:08:36.200
you make the transitions.

01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:38.210
So Kohlberg introduced
the whole notion

01:08:38.210 --> 01:08:41.819
that there are also sequences
of moral development.

01:08:41.819 --> 01:08:44.020
Very broadly what
he came up with

01:08:44.020 --> 01:08:47.330
were six different categories,
six different steps.

01:08:47.330 --> 01:08:50.479
And people, I take it, have
been spending the rest of time

01:08:50.479 --> 01:08:53.710
deciding whether there is,
in fact, 60 sub parts of that

01:08:53.710 --> 01:08:55.800
and splitting and
lumping all of that.

01:08:55.800 --> 01:08:59.050
Broadly these six stages
fall into three categories,

01:08:59.050 --> 01:09:04.090
what he called preconventional
moral reasoning,

01:09:04.090 --> 01:09:09.470
conventional moral reasoning,
and post-conventional moral

01:09:09.470 --> 01:09:11.010
reasoning.

01:09:11.010 --> 01:09:13.540
You might have guessed that
after the pre in conventional,

01:09:13.540 --> 01:09:15.350
but those were the three phases.

01:09:15.350 --> 01:09:18.529
And broadly they could
be termed or framed

01:09:18.529 --> 01:09:22.609
in terms of what the motivation
is for acting morally.

01:09:22.609 --> 01:09:26.240
In the preconventional stage,
why do you act morally?

01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:28.500
Because you may get caught.

01:09:28.500 --> 01:09:31.069
Because you may get punished.

01:09:31.069 --> 01:09:34.790
Because if you act morally,
maybe you'll get a reward.

01:09:34.790 --> 01:09:36.040
What's in it for me?

01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:41.160
A very ego centered set of
motivations for moral behavior.

01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:44.580
Then transitioning into
the conventional stage.

01:09:44.580 --> 01:09:46.880
How that is typically
framed as is

01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:49.660
your motivations for
your moral behavior

01:09:49.660 --> 01:09:53.760
are based on shared group
values, shared group

01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:54.740
conventions.

01:09:54.740 --> 01:09:57.820
Things built around
social norms.

01:09:57.820 --> 01:10:01.390
Rules, laws, even a
higher level of belief

01:10:01.390 --> 01:10:04.160
in the importance
of law and order

01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:07.360
in a society transcending
any given law,

01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:10.680
a notion that if you
follow conventional rules

01:10:10.680 --> 01:10:14.250
of moral reasoning you will
be viewed by society at large

01:10:14.250 --> 01:10:19.100
as a good girl, as a good boy
at whatever developmental stage.

01:10:19.100 --> 01:10:23.550
Your moral reasoning being
built around society-wide rules

01:10:23.550 --> 01:10:24.810
and implications.

01:10:24.810 --> 01:10:27.220
Finally, the
post-conventional stage

01:10:27.220 --> 01:10:29.620
is built around
transcending that.

01:10:29.620 --> 01:10:31.970
The word transcendence
plays a lot

01:10:31.970 --> 01:10:34.210
in that realm of
Kohlberg's thinking.

01:10:34.210 --> 01:10:37.930
The notion that there
are all sorts of examples

01:10:37.930 --> 01:10:40.980
of moral reasoning, moral
decision making, where

01:10:40.980 --> 01:10:45.090
you are, in fact, violating
the rules of society.

01:10:45.090 --> 01:10:46.800
You are breaking a law.

01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:48.870
You are breaking a social norm.

01:10:48.870 --> 01:10:50.800
What's the motivation there?

01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:52.610
The notion that
there are things that

01:10:52.610 --> 01:10:55.990
are more important than
the laws of society.

01:10:55.990 --> 01:10:58.480
There are things that are
more important than what

01:10:58.480 --> 01:10:59.970
everybody else thinks.

01:10:59.970 --> 01:11:03.870
What this has because it is the
world of civil disobedience.

01:11:03.870 --> 01:11:07.720
This is the world of saying,
bad laws need to be broken.

01:11:07.720 --> 01:11:09.780
This is the world
of people saying,

01:11:09.780 --> 01:11:12.280
I don't care if I get punished.

01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:15.100
I don't care what
everybody else is doing.

01:11:15.100 --> 01:11:16.940
This is the right thing to do.

01:11:16.940 --> 01:11:19.050
That would be a
post-conventional Kohlberg

01:11:19.050 --> 01:11:20.190
stage.

01:11:20.190 --> 01:11:22.625
The main thinking that
goes into sort of Kohlberg

01:11:22.625 --> 01:11:24.800
then looking at
adult moral reasoning

01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:28.210
is as you go through the various
steps and these sub steps

01:11:28.210 --> 01:11:31.050
and all sorts of tests that
ostensibly sort of tapped

01:11:31.050 --> 01:11:34.810
into it, not everybody
reaches the same Kohlberg

01:11:34.810 --> 01:11:36.460
stage in adulthood.

01:11:36.460 --> 01:11:39.320
People will stop in
their conventional stage.

01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:42.300
Some people will get to a
partial post-conventional

01:11:42.300 --> 01:11:42.970
stage.

01:11:42.970 --> 01:11:45.560
The way of thinking of
people within this framework

01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:49.670
is, how far do you progress
in your cold Kohlbergian

01:11:49.670 --> 01:11:54.340
sort of ladder of
complexity, sophistication,

01:11:54.340 --> 01:11:56.510
in your moral reasoning?

01:11:56.510 --> 01:11:58.330
Ways in which this would look.

01:11:58.330 --> 01:12:01.860
Take somebody and you can
have a Kohlberg stage of being

01:12:01.860 --> 01:12:03.740
very focused on the individual.

01:12:03.740 --> 01:12:05.860
Sort of studies
that will be done.

01:12:05.860 --> 01:12:09.500
You have a kid who believes
there is a baseball team.

01:12:09.500 --> 01:12:12.960
And they're told that
here's a bunch of kids.

01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:15.250
There's one more spot
left on the baseball team.

01:12:15.250 --> 01:12:18.420
And this has always been
a team for boys and boys

01:12:18.420 --> 01:12:20.210
play baseball better than girls.

01:12:20.210 --> 01:12:22.780
This was the sort of
way this type of study

01:12:22.780 --> 01:12:24.620
was done some decades ago.

01:12:24.620 --> 01:12:25.900
And here's a girl.

01:12:25.900 --> 01:12:27.900
Typically we don't
allow girls on the team.

01:12:27.900 --> 01:12:29.800
But this one girl wants to play.

01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:33.630
And what you see is at a
preconventional stage what kids

01:12:33.630 --> 01:12:37.200
are most likely to do is
reason morally on the level

01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:39.210
of individual consequences.

01:12:39.210 --> 01:12:43.136
Saying things like, well, she
hasn't gotten to play before.

01:12:43.136 --> 01:12:45.010
All of these boys have
gotten to play before.

01:12:45.010 --> 01:12:46.630
She's never gotten
to play before.

01:12:46.630 --> 01:12:47.660
It would be fair.

01:12:47.660 --> 01:12:49.770
She's the one who
should get to play.

01:12:49.770 --> 01:12:51.340
By the time you get
to kids reaching

01:12:51.340 --> 01:12:54.190
conventional moral
reasoning stages, what

01:12:54.190 --> 01:12:57.400
they're doing instead is
saying, well, boys are better.

01:12:57.400 --> 01:13:00.140
We need to put one of the
boys on because the team will

01:13:00.140 --> 01:13:01.750
be more successful.

01:13:01.750 --> 01:13:04.930
Suddenly moving from the level
of individual consequences

01:13:04.930 --> 01:13:09.700
to norms and law and order
and things of that sort.

01:13:09.700 --> 01:13:12.210
So the general
framework of Kohlberg.

01:13:12.210 --> 01:13:15.480
And amid that becoming
the dominating model.

01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:18.820
There has been a gazillion
totally appropriate criticisms

01:13:18.820 --> 01:13:20.080
of it.

01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:25.850
One is focusing right off the
bat on gender and the fact

01:13:25.850 --> 01:13:29.410
that Kohlberg, doing his
stuff mostly in the 1960s,

01:13:29.410 --> 01:13:32.100
had the same biases as most
everyone of the time, which

01:13:32.100 --> 01:13:34.400
was a very disproportionate
share of the studies

01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:37.210
were done on males
rather than females.

01:13:37.210 --> 01:13:40.050
The notion that Kohlbergian
reasoning sequences

01:13:40.050 --> 01:13:42.510
of moral development are
a better fit for what

01:13:42.510 --> 01:13:46.820
happens in boys and men
than in women, girls.

01:13:46.820 --> 01:13:50.120
That boys are more about
justice girls are more about

01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:53.550
affiliation, reconciliation,
things of that sort.

01:13:53.550 --> 01:13:55.650
So a gender critique.

01:13:55.650 --> 01:13:57.660
Next is a cultural critique.

01:13:57.660 --> 01:13:59.410
And there's been a
whole world of people

01:13:59.410 --> 01:14:02.620
doing cross-cultural moral
development in [INAUDIBLE] type

01:14:02.620 --> 01:14:03.250
studies.

01:14:03.250 --> 01:14:06.400
And one thing that you
see is that the stages

01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:09.620
don't necessarily move in
this inevitable sequence

01:14:09.620 --> 01:14:10.810
in different cultures.

01:14:10.810 --> 01:14:13.345
So that has been sort
of a blow to this.

01:14:13.345 --> 01:14:17.620
This is how all humans are.

01:14:17.620 --> 01:14:20.180
What you also begin
to see is when

01:14:20.180 --> 01:14:23.620
you begin to couple
sort of other values

01:14:23.620 --> 01:14:25.070
with your moral stage.

01:14:25.070 --> 01:14:28.480
For example, what
studies show is people

01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:33.040
who are trained in childhood
to respect ability more than

01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:38.340
effort are far more likely
to endorse social norm

01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:42.570
moral reasoning over
social justice reasoning.

01:14:42.570 --> 01:14:43.890
That is shown.

01:14:43.890 --> 01:14:45.000
What's that one about?

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.910
Again, ability--
having something

01:14:47.910 --> 01:14:52.030
that you view as transcendent,
as not intrinsic to sort

01:14:52.030 --> 01:14:54.152
of the effort of the person.

01:14:54.152 --> 01:14:55.110
That's making no sense.

01:14:55.110 --> 01:14:56.900
I just tied that into knots.

01:14:56.900 --> 01:14:58.290
Don't listen to
what I just said.

01:14:58.290 --> 01:15:00.760
Nonetheless, here's
what they have found.

01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:05.070
People who were brought up to
value ability more than effort

01:15:05.070 --> 01:15:09.090
tend to value moral
reasoning for social norms

01:15:09.090 --> 01:15:11.080
rather than for social justice.

01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:14.740
They are less likely to get to
a post-conventional Kohlberg

01:15:14.740 --> 01:15:15.720
stage.

01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:18.055
So that being one of
the backbones of people

01:15:18.055 --> 01:15:18.930
who think about this.

01:15:18.930 --> 01:15:21.210
But a whole world
of additional things

01:15:21.210 --> 01:15:23.130
in moral development and kids.

01:15:23.130 --> 01:15:27.900
How do kids first learn that
sometimes it's OK to lie?

01:15:27.900 --> 01:15:30.180
How do kids learn
that, in fact, you're

01:15:30.180 --> 01:15:33.890
supposed to tell grandma that
you love the sweater even

01:15:33.890 --> 01:15:35.320
though you think it's awful?

01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:38.700
Or do not tell her you
already have this toy?

01:15:38.700 --> 01:15:41.430
How do you kids learn to lie?

01:15:41.430 --> 01:15:43.510
Related to that,
how do kids first

01:15:43.510 --> 01:15:47.600
learn the difference between
rules and principles?

01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:50.080
Rules that are meant
to be less breakable,

01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:53.590
principles where you are having
to balance them to weigh them.

01:15:53.590 --> 01:15:56.240
When do kids first learn
about the possibility

01:15:56.240 --> 01:15:58.290
of there being bad laws?

01:15:58.290 --> 01:15:59.910
That just because
something is a law

01:15:59.910 --> 01:16:01.950
doesn't mean it is
necessarily good?

01:16:01.950 --> 01:16:05.900
When do kids first start to
consistently make distinctions

01:16:05.900 --> 01:16:10.500
between or see the similarities
between intended harm

01:16:10.500 --> 01:16:12.470
and successful harm?

01:16:12.470 --> 01:16:15.630
At an earlier stage
kids discount activities

01:16:15.630 --> 01:16:17.660
that don't actually
produce the harm

01:16:17.660 --> 01:16:20.740
that it was meant to
if it's not successful.

01:16:20.740 --> 01:16:24.590
When do kids begin to see that
they are more similar than they

01:16:24.590 --> 01:16:25.560
initially respond to?

01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:29.600
All of these nuances,
subtleties, here.

01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:32.110
Other ways that people have
thought about development

01:16:32.110 --> 01:16:33.340
of aggression.

01:16:33.340 --> 01:16:37.360
Now comes the issue of
peer groups and community

01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:41.540
and aspects of what sort of
world are you being exposed to?

01:16:41.540 --> 01:16:45.480
What this always
comes down to is,

01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:48.430
what are the effects on
violence in growing up

01:16:48.430 --> 01:16:51.600
in a violent setting and
being witness to violence

01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:52.990
and being a victim of violence?

01:16:52.990 --> 01:16:54.940
We've already seen
one realm of this

01:16:54.940 --> 01:16:58.770
which is the greater the
incidence of childhood abuse,

01:16:58.770 --> 01:17:02.480
the greater the likelihood
of adult anti-social behavior

01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:05.900
and a huge
interaction with genes

01:17:05.900 --> 01:17:09.220
that have a relevance
to the neurochemistry.

01:17:09.220 --> 01:17:10.730
What else is shown?

01:17:10.730 --> 01:17:13.750
Consistently, study
after study, shows

01:17:13.750 --> 01:17:16.850
that independent of
family circumstances,

01:17:16.850 --> 01:17:20.730
socioeconomic status, personal
experience of violence,

01:17:20.730 --> 01:17:22.630
after controlling
for all of that,

01:17:22.630 --> 01:17:24.300
growing up in a
neighborhood where

01:17:24.300 --> 01:17:27.300
there is a lot of violence
feeds into a higher

01:17:27.300 --> 01:17:28.850
rate of violence in adulthood.

01:17:28.850 --> 01:17:30.960
What it does is rationalize it.

01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:33.130
What it does is it desensitizes.

01:17:33.130 --> 01:17:34.810
So that is shown consistently.

01:17:34.810 --> 01:17:38.490
What is shown is there is even
a stronger effect, tapping

01:17:38.490 --> 01:17:40.960
right into this,
when one is witness

01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:42.405
to violence within the family.

01:17:42.405 --> 01:17:44.370
So violence within
neighborhoods.

01:17:44.370 --> 01:17:46.500
This was worked on a
number of years ago.

01:17:46.500 --> 01:17:48.640
Sociologist,
psychiatrist at Harvard

01:17:48.640 --> 01:17:52.770
named Felton Earls going through
very, very careful studies

01:17:52.770 --> 01:17:54.750
controlling for all
sorts of factors

01:17:54.750 --> 01:17:57.290
of how many violent
acts were kids

01:17:57.290 --> 01:18:00.360
seeing in various
communities as they grew up.

01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:03.660
And that is a very strong
predictor in and of itself.

01:18:03.660 --> 01:18:07.800
Violent acts within the
family even more so.

01:18:07.800 --> 01:18:09.910
That, of course,
brings up another one

01:18:09.910 --> 01:18:12.350
of the great perpetual
questions is,

01:18:12.350 --> 01:18:14.740
what is the effect on
adult violence of having

01:18:14.740 --> 01:18:18.590
been a kid growing up watching
a lot of violent television

01:18:18.590 --> 01:18:21.600
or a lot of violent movies
or, as the studies are now

01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:24.850
beginning to be there, to
ask violent video games?

01:18:24.850 --> 01:18:26.180
What's that one about?

01:18:26.180 --> 01:18:28.230
And every parent for
decades has known,

01:18:28.230 --> 01:18:30.860
of course, what the worry,
which is watching violence

01:18:30.860 --> 01:18:33.440
in any sort of version
of media like this

01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:35.860
is going to foster
violence intensely.

01:18:35.860 --> 01:18:37.310
Well studied subject.

01:18:37.310 --> 01:18:39.450
And what the results
generally show

01:18:39.450 --> 01:18:42.130
is-- yes, here it comes again.

01:18:42.130 --> 01:18:43.430
The same exact thing.

01:18:43.430 --> 01:18:46.760
Watching a lot of violent
television when you were a kid

01:18:46.760 --> 01:18:49.660
makes you more violent
if you already are

01:18:49.660 --> 01:18:51.440
tending towards being violent.

01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:54.760
What it does is it exaggerates
the pre-existing social

01:18:54.760 --> 01:18:55.620
tendencies.

01:18:55.620 --> 01:18:57.070
You know that drill by now.

01:18:57.070 --> 01:19:01.040
After this lecture you could now
pull out half a dozen examples

01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:05.160
of x does not cause whatever,
but it magnifies or blunts

01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:06.680
preexisting tendencies.

01:19:06.680 --> 01:19:09.150
That's what the literature
consistently shows.

01:19:09.150 --> 01:19:12.850
Violent television,
movies, reading material

01:19:12.850 --> 01:19:17.050
and violent video games does
not increase the likelihood

01:19:17.050 --> 01:19:18.140
of being violent.

01:19:18.140 --> 01:19:19.650
It's only in kids
who are already

01:19:19.650 --> 01:19:22.380
predisposed towards that.

01:19:22.380 --> 01:19:25.460
Next, more aspects
of environment.

01:19:25.460 --> 01:19:29.990
Here we have the summary of
the classic study that was

01:19:29.990 --> 01:19:31.710
done a couple of decades ago.

01:19:31.710 --> 01:19:34.540
Couple at the University of
Toronto named Daly and Wilson.

01:19:34.540 --> 01:19:37.750
And what they did was
look at the likelihood

01:19:37.750 --> 01:19:42.807
of men committing murder
as a function of their age.

01:19:42.807 --> 01:19:45.390
And they were interested in age
because they were viewing that

01:19:45.390 --> 01:19:47.770
as a proxy for
testosterone levels.

01:19:47.770 --> 01:19:50.170
And what they showed looking
in three different cities--

01:19:50.170 --> 01:19:53.570
Chicago, Toronto, and London--
which was in all those cities

01:19:53.570 --> 01:19:57.490
your likelihood of being
violent or committing a murder,

01:19:57.490 --> 01:20:00.410
if you were male was
somewhere late teenage years

01:20:00.410 --> 01:20:02.070
into early 20s or so.

01:20:02.070 --> 01:20:03.850
I drew this a little bit wrong.

01:20:03.850 --> 01:20:06.540
And that was fascinating
to them because that

01:20:06.540 --> 01:20:09.890
happens to be the time of life
when males have their highest

01:20:09.890 --> 01:20:11.080
testosterone levels.

01:20:11.080 --> 01:20:14.090
And what was hugely
interesting in that study

01:20:14.090 --> 01:20:17.360
was that the curves were
superimposable in these three

01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:18.450
different cities.

01:20:18.450 --> 01:20:22.410
One American city, one Canadian
city, one British city.

01:20:22.410 --> 01:20:24.670
So you could now ask
the sort of question

01:20:24.670 --> 01:20:26.890
that we've had coming up
since the behavior genetics

01:20:26.890 --> 01:20:30.260
lectures, which is if
you could know only one

01:20:30.260 --> 01:20:33.065
thing about these
group of individual men

01:20:33.065 --> 01:20:35.190
and you want to know
something about predictability

01:20:35.190 --> 01:20:37.799
of their being aggressive,
what's the one thing you would

01:20:37.799 --> 01:20:38.340
want to know?

01:20:38.340 --> 01:20:41.720
Well, it would be mighty useful
to know how old they are.

01:20:41.720 --> 01:20:45.180
Because this suggests a big
age effect and maybe that's

01:20:45.180 --> 01:20:47.120
got something to do with
the high testosterone

01:20:47.120 --> 01:20:48.440
at that point.

01:20:48.440 --> 01:20:50.800
And one of these sort
of relevant to that,

01:20:50.800 --> 01:20:53.860
sort of a classic sort of
sound byte in criminology,

01:20:53.860 --> 01:20:58.030
is one of the leading causes of
a decrease in criminal behavior

01:20:58.030 --> 01:21:00.380
is people turning age 25.

01:21:00.380 --> 01:21:03.170
It's a very, very strong
maturational curve.

01:21:03.170 --> 01:21:03.947
So look at that.

01:21:03.947 --> 01:21:05.030
Look at this is important.

01:21:05.030 --> 01:21:07.870
This is sort of life
history trajectory.

01:21:07.870 --> 01:21:10.910
But then you look at something
even more interesting,

01:21:10.910 --> 01:21:14.160
which is you ask, so how
many murders are there

01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:15.540
in each of these cities?

01:21:15.540 --> 01:21:20.070
And in their database the
London one averaged 30 year,

01:21:20.070 --> 01:21:25.290
Toronto averaged 50, and
Chicago averaged 600.

01:21:25.290 --> 01:21:27.530
So now you have a choice.

01:21:27.530 --> 01:21:30.840
You could find out one
fact and one fact only.

01:21:30.840 --> 01:21:34.570
Do I want to know how old this
individual is or-- let's even

01:21:34.570 --> 01:21:37.100
be fancier-- do I want
to know this individual's

01:21:37.100 --> 01:21:39.150
testosterone levels and his age?

01:21:39.150 --> 01:21:40.840
Do I want to know
that information

01:21:40.840 --> 01:21:44.170
or do I want to know what
society he's been growing up

01:21:44.170 --> 01:21:44.680
with?

01:21:44.680 --> 01:21:47.880
Without question you
get more predictability.

01:21:47.880 --> 01:21:50.060
This is far more important.

01:21:50.060 --> 01:21:52.880
We now can sort of put
inheritability type

01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:54.150
interpretations.

01:21:54.150 --> 01:21:55.750
Yeah, this is important.

01:21:55.750 --> 01:21:57.970
But it doesn't hold
a candle to whatever

01:21:57.970 --> 01:22:01.640
these environmental factors
are in there-- far, far

01:22:01.640 --> 01:22:05.940
bigger effects than the
age effect happening here.

01:22:05.940 --> 01:22:07.810
What else?

01:22:07.810 --> 01:22:11.350
So again, this business
about socialization involving

01:22:11.350 --> 01:22:13.430
lots of teaching of context.

01:22:13.430 --> 01:22:16.240
And more evidence for this
came from one of the all time

01:22:16.240 --> 01:22:19.510
classic studies, one that
was referred to in the sex

01:22:19.510 --> 01:22:20.010
lectures.

01:22:20.010 --> 01:22:23.010
And this was the work
by that guy Harry Harlow

01:22:23.010 --> 01:22:25.220
raising captive rhesus monkeys.

01:22:25.220 --> 01:22:27.310
And we heard
different variations.

01:22:27.310 --> 01:22:29.370
Raising them without a mother.

01:22:29.370 --> 01:22:32.140
Raising them in social
groups with peers.

01:22:32.140 --> 01:22:34.820
Raising them in complete
social isolation.

01:22:34.820 --> 01:22:36.780
And what we heard
last week was, it

01:22:36.780 --> 01:22:41.020
did not change the fixed action
patterns of sexual behavior.

01:22:41.020 --> 01:22:42.562
It changed the context.

01:22:42.562 --> 01:22:44.020
In other words,
you had monkeys who

01:22:44.020 --> 01:22:47.470
had grown up in some of the most
of the isolated environments

01:22:47.470 --> 01:22:50.480
and they were trying to do sex
normally but just with things

01:22:50.480 --> 01:22:53.120
that the monkeys don't
normally have sex with.

01:22:53.120 --> 01:22:56.090
The same exact thing in the
realm of aggression here.

01:22:56.090 --> 01:22:58.640
Being raised, for example,
in social isolation

01:22:58.640 --> 01:23:01.580
as a rhesus monkey, then in
the young adulthood you're

01:23:01.580 --> 01:23:06.230
put into a social group and you
have perfectly normal threat

01:23:06.230 --> 01:23:06.730
yawns.

01:23:06.730 --> 01:23:09.760
You have perfectly normal
fixed action patterns

01:23:09.760 --> 01:23:12.090
of dominance and subordination.

01:23:12.090 --> 01:23:15.350
What you don't know is who
you should be doing it to.

01:23:15.350 --> 01:23:17.660
And Harlow showed that
these animals then put

01:23:17.660 --> 01:23:20.320
into social groups
were threatening

01:23:20.320 --> 01:23:21.890
high ranking males
they shouldn't

01:23:21.890 --> 01:23:23.140
have been going anywhere near.

01:23:23.140 --> 01:23:26.040
Were terrified and
subordinating themselves

01:23:26.040 --> 01:23:29.100
to little pipsqueak infants
there, things of that sort.

01:23:29.100 --> 01:23:32.870
They had not learned the
appropriate social context.

01:23:32.870 --> 01:23:35.260
And that's an awful
lot of what's going on.

01:23:35.260 --> 01:23:36.404
Example of this.

01:23:36.404 --> 01:23:38.070
And this is one that
I actually observed

01:23:38.070 --> 01:23:42.270
in my baboons some years ago
and this business about context.

01:23:42.270 --> 01:23:45.990
Back to baboons and female
baboons, the business there.

01:23:45.990 --> 01:23:47.810
If you are a high
ranking female,

01:23:47.810 --> 01:23:50.640
you have far more options to
be aggressive than if you're

01:23:50.640 --> 01:23:51.710
a low ranking one.

01:23:51.710 --> 01:23:54.560
You inherit your rank
from your mother.

01:23:54.560 --> 01:23:56.720
If your mother is
number one in the troop,

01:23:56.720 --> 01:23:58.740
you, her first daughter,
will be number two.

01:23:58.740 --> 01:24:01.770
If your mother was number 12
and your her second daughter,

01:24:01.770 --> 01:24:03.570
you're going to be number 14.

01:24:03.570 --> 01:24:05.400
It's a hereditary system.

01:24:05.400 --> 01:24:07.630
And this was some
years ago where it just

01:24:07.630 --> 01:24:11.250
happened in one of my troops
the highest ranking female who

01:24:11.250 --> 01:24:13.430
was still fertile,
her mother matriarch

01:24:13.430 --> 01:24:15.160
was one step above her.

01:24:15.160 --> 01:24:17.020
But this female,
the highest ranking

01:24:17.020 --> 01:24:20.100
for a female, gave birth,
had her first daughter.

01:24:20.100 --> 01:24:22.210
And it just happened
a day later one

01:24:22.210 --> 01:24:24.330
of the lower ranking
females in the troop

01:24:24.330 --> 01:24:26.180
also gave birth
and had a daughter.

01:24:26.180 --> 01:24:29.650
So suddenly you've got this
great side by side comparison.

01:24:29.650 --> 01:24:32.900
And what you see was every
developmental landmark

01:24:32.900 --> 01:24:36.120
the high ranking kid was hitting
earlier than the other kid just

01:24:36.120 --> 01:24:38.840
in terms of sheer physical
maturation, coordination,

01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:39.570
all of that.

01:24:39.570 --> 01:24:41.710
When they were about
a week old, they

01:24:41.710 --> 01:24:44.090
had their first
social interaction.

01:24:44.090 --> 01:24:46.850
Low ranking infant spots
the high ranking one

01:24:46.850 --> 01:24:48.750
and obviously is
thrilled, finally

01:24:48.750 --> 01:24:50.686
seeing somebody else
the same size as them

01:24:50.686 --> 01:24:52.560
instead of just looking
at everybody's knees.

01:24:52.560 --> 01:24:54.940
And the low ranking
one goes wobbling over

01:24:54.940 --> 01:24:56.430
to sort of greet this other one.

01:24:56.430 --> 01:24:58.350
And as she gets about
three steps away

01:24:58.350 --> 01:25:01.310
from a high ranking
infant, low ranking mom

01:25:01.310 --> 01:25:04.480
leans over, grabs her
daughter by the tail,

01:25:04.480 --> 01:25:06.750
and pulls her back.

01:25:06.750 --> 01:25:09.620
And she had just
gotten her first lesson

01:25:09.620 --> 01:25:13.250
in her appropriate social rank
and her appropriate social

01:25:13.250 --> 01:25:14.100
behavior.

01:25:14.100 --> 01:25:15.690
She had just gotten
the first lesson

01:25:15.690 --> 01:25:19.429
that that is not somebody you
go up to and interact with.

01:25:19.429 --> 01:25:20.970
If you're going to
interact with her,

01:25:20.970 --> 01:25:24.470
what it's going to consist
of is you sitting real still

01:25:24.470 --> 01:25:26.850
and don't make any
eye contact and hope

01:25:26.850 --> 01:25:27.920
she doesn't notice you.

01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:30.630
And if she does, immediately
make a subordinate gesture.

01:25:30.630 --> 01:25:33.310
You do not go and walk
up to her to greet her.

01:25:33.310 --> 01:25:36.120
And the amazing thing is
at that point you pick up

01:25:36.120 --> 01:25:38.660
and you come back 25
years later and there

01:25:38.660 --> 01:25:41.600
are going to be two old ladies
out in the savanna there doing

01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:43.840
the same exact
ominous interactions

01:25:43.840 --> 01:25:46.240
that they learned in
their first week of life.

01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:50.510
Very, very early social
training for this.

01:25:50.510 --> 01:25:53.630
Finally, another bit of evidence
for that social training, which

01:25:53.630 --> 01:25:56.730
we already heard about, the
captive hyenas growing up

01:25:56.730 --> 01:25:59.310
without adults there
took much longer

01:25:59.310 --> 01:26:02.410
to come through with the
same social dominance system

01:26:02.410 --> 01:26:05.230
that you would see with
animals in the wild.

01:26:05.230 --> 01:26:07.590
So the question then
becomes, amid all

01:26:07.590 --> 01:26:10.700
of this social environment
mattering hugely,

01:26:10.700 --> 01:26:14.420
how important are parents and
how important is peer group?

01:26:14.420 --> 01:26:16.920
And a very, very
interesting book

01:26:16.920 --> 01:26:19.610
came out about a decade
ago by a psychologist

01:26:19.610 --> 01:26:23.010
named Judith Rich Harris
called The Nurture Assumption.

01:26:23.010 --> 01:26:26.110
And what she did was
basically strongly

01:26:26.110 --> 01:26:28.890
attack the literature
on parental influence

01:26:28.890 --> 01:26:30.200
on child development.

01:26:30.200 --> 01:26:33.140
And her argument was
that peer influences

01:26:33.140 --> 01:26:38.200
are vastly more powerful than
the field usually recognizes.

01:26:38.200 --> 01:26:39.540
Great story with her.

01:26:39.540 --> 01:26:41.980
She was about 60 at the time.

01:26:41.980 --> 01:26:45.180
And many decades before she
had been a graduate student

01:26:45.180 --> 01:26:47.130
in psychology at Harvard.

01:26:47.130 --> 01:26:49.070
And something was
not working out

01:26:49.070 --> 01:26:51.130
and she was expelled
from the program.

01:26:51.130 --> 01:26:54.120
And the chair of the
department, a guy named

01:26:54.120 --> 01:26:56.840
George Miller at the time,
was the one who told her

01:26:56.840 --> 01:26:58.280
that this wasn't working out.

01:26:58.280 --> 01:27:01.820
So good luck and off
you go to trade school

01:27:01.820 --> 01:27:05.580
and she proceeded to,
never finishing her degree,

01:27:05.580 --> 01:27:09.210
become a science writer
and writing science books

01:27:09.210 --> 01:27:10.260
for kids or whatever.

01:27:10.260 --> 01:27:13.310
And around age 55 she started
writing this book, which

01:27:13.310 --> 01:27:16.790
wound up being an
amazing book, extremely

01:27:16.790 --> 01:27:20.170
influential in the field, where
she got all sorts of prizes

01:27:20.170 --> 01:27:23.160
for being the first
book by a young author.

01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:25.540
Young author, 60 years
old at that point.

01:27:25.540 --> 01:27:27.040
And one of the great
ironies was she

01:27:27.040 --> 01:27:29.710
got like the grand
prize for the first book

01:27:29.710 --> 01:27:32.080
at the annual meeting of
the American Psychological

01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:35.430
Association, getting this
prize called the George Miller

01:27:35.430 --> 01:27:39.610
Award given out by the now
very elderly George Miller.

01:27:39.610 --> 01:27:42.950
So one of those like a nice
ironic ending things and she

01:27:42.950 --> 01:27:45.750
didn't like trip him up
or something like that

01:27:45.750 --> 01:27:47.860
as she perhaps might
have considered.

01:27:47.860 --> 01:27:49.260
So Judith Rich Harris.

01:27:49.260 --> 01:27:53.850
So her basic argument is that
peer socialization is really,

01:27:53.850 --> 01:27:56.150
really one of the
most powerful things.

01:27:56.150 --> 01:27:58.100
And where she
begins her argument

01:27:58.100 --> 01:28:00.980
is one which, as soon
as you think about it,

01:28:00.980 --> 01:28:02.790
is really striking.

01:28:02.790 --> 01:28:06.250
You look at children who are
growing up in a household

01:28:06.250 --> 01:28:09.230
where the home language
is a different one

01:28:09.230 --> 01:28:11.590
than the dominant
language in the culture.

01:28:11.590 --> 01:28:13.870
You're growing up in
an immigrant family.

01:28:13.870 --> 01:28:18.430
And what the studies show
is by age four or five

01:28:18.430 --> 01:28:22.870
you were developing the accent
of the community around you,

01:28:22.870 --> 01:28:24.390
of your peer groups.

01:28:24.390 --> 01:28:26.920
By age four or five
you were already

01:28:26.920 --> 01:28:30.960
beginning to become embarrassed
by your parent's accent.

01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:33.400
By age four or five
you were beginning

01:28:33.400 --> 01:28:36.760
to answer their questions
or their conversation

01:28:36.760 --> 01:28:38.840
in the home language
and answering it

01:28:38.840 --> 01:28:40.440
in the outside language.

01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:43.210
This occurs at an
amazingly early age.

01:28:43.210 --> 01:28:44.800
And as soon as you
think about it, oh,

01:28:44.800 --> 01:28:48.960
of course, somebody whose
parents are from Maine

01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:50.889
but they grew up
down in Louisiana,

01:28:50.889 --> 01:28:52.930
they're not going to grow
up with a Maine accent.

01:28:52.930 --> 01:28:56.070
They may be able to mimic
their parents very readily.

01:28:56.070 --> 01:28:59.110
But they're going to
develop a regional accent.

01:28:59.110 --> 01:29:02.100
People pick up the accents
of their peer group,

01:29:02.100 --> 01:29:03.310
not of their parents.

01:29:03.310 --> 01:29:05.920
So she uses that sort of
as the jumping off point

01:29:05.920 --> 01:29:09.170
for beginning to argue all the
different ways in which peer

01:29:09.170 --> 01:29:10.930
groups are the
things that matter.

01:29:10.930 --> 01:29:12.980
And at the end of
the day what parents

01:29:12.980 --> 01:29:16.840
are mostly good for is
determining what peer groups

01:29:16.840 --> 01:29:18.920
kids have access to.

01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:20.770
Sort of evidence she would show.

01:29:20.770 --> 01:29:23.300
And this begins
the whole world of

01:29:23.300 --> 01:29:27.040
conformity and conventionalized
behavior by groups.

01:29:27.040 --> 01:29:29.880
This begins a whole world
of the studies where

01:29:29.880 --> 01:29:34.120
showing you arbitrarily break
kids into groups by age group

01:29:34.120 --> 01:29:36.720
and they start having
disparaging beliefs

01:29:36.720 --> 01:29:37.960
about the other group.

01:29:37.960 --> 01:29:40.640
This is suddenly
Zimbardo studies.

01:29:40.640 --> 01:29:43.120
This is suddenly put
people arbitrarily

01:29:43.120 --> 01:29:45.810
into one category
or role and they

01:29:45.810 --> 01:29:47.930
begin to over identify
with that group.

01:29:47.930 --> 01:29:51.160
Here is one of the greatest
bits of evidence for peer

01:29:51.160 --> 01:29:52.840
socialization I've ever heard.

01:29:52.840 --> 01:29:56.170
And this was documented in at
least two different people's

01:29:56.170 --> 01:29:56.900
memoirs.

01:29:56.900 --> 01:29:59.080
People who were
actors on the set

01:29:59.080 --> 01:30:03.580
of the original Planet of
the Apes movies in the 1960s.

01:30:03.580 --> 01:30:05.310
And what they noted--
I think you could

01:30:05.310 --> 01:30:08.220
either there, besides being one
of the three or four humans,

01:30:08.220 --> 01:30:09.920
you could either be
a chimp or a gorilla

01:30:09.920 --> 01:30:12.810
or an orangutan all of
which were not anatomically

01:30:12.810 --> 01:30:14.900
correct or politically correct.

01:30:14.900 --> 01:30:17.420
But what they wound
up seeing there

01:30:17.420 --> 01:30:19.340
was two of these
people in their memoirs

01:30:19.340 --> 01:30:23.130
noted that by the first week
of filming having happened

01:30:23.130 --> 01:30:25.805
people sat at lunch
separated by species.

01:30:25.805 --> 01:30:26.780
[LAUGHTER]

01:30:26.780 --> 01:30:29.730
All of the actors who
were chimps ate together.

01:30:29.730 --> 01:30:33.150
All of the onee-- and these
were people who had friends,

01:30:33.150 --> 01:30:36.120
some of their best friends
were orangutans and things

01:30:36.120 --> 01:30:38.320
of that sort who they
had known for years.

01:30:38.320 --> 01:30:40.210
But two different
people's memoirs

01:30:40.210 --> 01:30:42.830
noting sort of-- who were
actors in that-- noting

01:30:42.830 --> 01:30:45.780
this bizarre thing that
emerged that people would only

01:30:45.780 --> 01:30:48.340
have lunch with their
other primate species.

01:30:48.340 --> 01:30:51.760
So that presumably
vindicates everything

01:30:51.760 --> 01:30:53.620
that Judith Rich Harris says.

01:30:53.620 --> 01:30:57.080
So what she has done is
reinterpret certain findings.

01:30:57.080 --> 01:31:00.330
For example, showing that one
of the things that you find

01:31:00.330 --> 01:31:02.500
is kids growing up,
boys growing up,

01:31:02.500 --> 01:31:05.030
in households without
a father have a higher

01:31:05.030 --> 01:31:09.300
chance of anti-social violence
as an adult. And what she does

01:31:09.300 --> 01:31:11.780
is take apart that
literature and shows

01:31:11.780 --> 01:31:15.730
that what the actual variable
is, is that boys growing up

01:31:15.730 --> 01:31:18.170
in families without a
father, single parent

01:31:18.170 --> 01:31:21.500
households, single mother,
they are more likely to live

01:31:21.500 --> 01:31:23.190
in a poorer neighborhood.

01:31:23.190 --> 01:31:26.500
And it is, in fact, the peer
socialization there which

01:31:26.500 --> 01:31:28.090
is the driving force on it.

01:31:28.090 --> 01:31:30.250
Fancy statistics to show that.

01:31:30.250 --> 01:31:32.710
That's the sort of
argument she makes.

01:31:32.710 --> 01:31:35.510
Finally, one of the
most interesting studies

01:31:35.510 --> 01:31:37.370
that's ever occurred
in this realm

01:31:37.370 --> 01:31:39.220
came out about 15 years ago.

01:31:39.220 --> 01:31:42.060
One law professor here at
Stanford and one economist

01:31:42.060 --> 01:31:46.720
at University of Chicago making
a very interesting argument

01:31:46.720 --> 01:31:50.480
as a predictor of criminal
behavior in people.

01:31:50.480 --> 01:31:53.220
And what these two did,
Levitt and Donahue, they

01:31:53.220 --> 01:31:55.200
dealt with what
was then emerging

01:31:55.200 --> 01:31:58.630
as a really interesting
sociological phenomenon which

01:31:58.630 --> 01:32:01.430
was that somewhere
since the late 1980s,

01:32:01.430 --> 01:32:04.330
the crime rate in this
country has been plummeting.

01:32:04.330 --> 01:32:06.030
Every city, every state.

01:32:06.030 --> 01:32:07.380
It's been going way down.

01:32:07.380 --> 01:32:09.570
And for years people
have been wrestling with,

01:32:09.570 --> 01:32:12.790
what's going on the decreased
crime rate in general?

01:32:12.790 --> 01:32:15.830
If you have a more conservative
bent which you would emphasize

01:32:15.830 --> 01:32:19.240
is building of more prisons
during this period, three

01:32:19.240 --> 01:32:21.805
strike laws, things
like that that

01:32:21.805 --> 01:32:25.480
have put in more institutional
punishment, more policing.

01:32:25.480 --> 01:32:28.430
If you have a more liberal
bent, what you emphasize

01:32:28.430 --> 01:32:31.410
is how good the economy
was during the '90s.

01:32:31.410 --> 01:32:33.480
But that winds up
being problematic

01:32:33.480 --> 01:32:34.980
because the crime
rate has continued

01:32:34.980 --> 01:32:37.140
to drop over the last
three, four years

01:32:37.140 --> 01:32:39.020
amid the economy tanking.

01:32:39.020 --> 01:32:41.890
All these various explanations
explain a bit of it,

01:32:41.890 --> 01:32:44.900
but what these guys
argued was as follows.

01:32:44.900 --> 01:32:46.470
That the decreased
crime rate that

01:32:46.470 --> 01:32:49.380
started in the United
States in the late 1980s

01:32:49.380 --> 01:32:53.290
was due to Roe v. Wade.

01:32:53.290 --> 01:32:55.220
Here's what they would show.

01:32:55.220 --> 01:33:00.090
They would show that as each
state would legalize abortion,

01:33:00.090 --> 01:33:03.390
you would have about a
12 to 15 year lag time

01:33:03.390 --> 01:33:06.390
before you would start to
have the crime rate drop.

01:33:06.390 --> 01:33:09.090
The crime rate during
the first five years

01:33:09.090 --> 01:33:11.380
of the crime rate
dropping would entirely

01:33:11.380 --> 01:33:15.400
be due to fewer teenagers
entering the criminal justice

01:33:15.400 --> 01:33:16.200
system.

01:33:16.200 --> 01:33:19.060
By the time it was a
decade and a half or so

01:33:19.060 --> 01:33:21.740
past Roe versus-- past
that first point--

01:33:21.740 --> 01:33:25.140
the drop in crime rate was
entirely due to fewer 15

01:33:25.140 --> 01:33:26.180
to 30-year-olds.

01:33:26.180 --> 01:33:28.732
And it just marched out
from there state by state.

01:33:28.732 --> 01:33:31.190
What their numbers showed when
they did what were currently

01:33:31.190 --> 01:33:33.600
some pretty fancy
convincing statistics

01:33:33.600 --> 01:33:37.080
was that Roe versus Wade
accounted for about 50%

01:33:37.080 --> 01:33:38.720
of the drop in crime.

01:33:38.720 --> 01:33:40.290
What's that telling you?

01:33:40.290 --> 01:33:43.890
One of the most depressing
things I can imagine,

01:33:43.890 --> 01:33:47.740
which is a huge, huge
predictor of growing up

01:33:47.740 --> 01:33:50.660
to be a violent
antisocial individual

01:33:50.660 --> 01:33:54.800
is having been born when
nobody wanted you to be born.

01:33:54.800 --> 01:33:58.790
And what Roe v. Wade, what
the ability to have abortions,

01:33:58.790 --> 01:34:00.840
introduced in much
of the country

01:34:00.840 --> 01:34:04.200
at that time-- introduced
was the ability of someone

01:34:04.200 --> 01:34:06.970
to not have a child who
they didn't want to have.

01:34:06.970 --> 01:34:09.560
Being born to a mother who
doesn't want to have you,

01:34:09.560 --> 01:34:12.250
that turns out to be a pretty
big predictor of life not going

01:34:12.250 --> 01:34:14.260
well after that.

01:34:14.260 --> 01:34:15.240
Final piece.

01:34:15.240 --> 01:34:17.810
Final piece in
this, which is now

01:34:17.810 --> 01:34:19.990
when you look at all
of this development

01:34:19.990 --> 01:34:22.360
and aggression and
moral whatevers,

01:34:22.360 --> 01:34:25.060
what does it wind up
looking like in adulthood?

01:34:25.060 --> 01:34:27.760
What this translates into
is asking the question,

01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:32.490
how much does one stage of
Kohlbergian moral development

01:34:32.490 --> 01:34:35.480
actually predict who
does something moral?

01:34:35.480 --> 01:34:38.470
In other words, is
there a good correlation

01:34:38.470 --> 01:34:41.870
between moral reasoning
and moral behavior?

01:34:41.870 --> 01:34:44.640
And what the literature
is absolutely clear on

01:34:44.640 --> 01:34:47.600
is there's not a
particularly good connection.

01:34:47.600 --> 01:34:51.670
You've got some fancy dancy
post-conventional transcendent

01:34:51.670 --> 01:34:55.630
Kohlbergian stage and you even
have a certificate to prove it.

01:34:55.630 --> 01:34:57.960
And that's not
remotely a predictor

01:34:57.960 --> 01:35:01.020
of you being more likely
to be the person who

01:35:01.020 --> 01:35:04.990
steps out of the anonymous crowd
and saves the drowning child.

01:35:04.990 --> 01:35:07.250
There's no connection
with Kohlberg stage.

01:35:07.250 --> 01:35:09.400
Having the fancier
Kohlberg stage

01:35:09.400 --> 01:35:12.530
is a pretty good predictor that
you'll be a moral philosophy

01:35:12.530 --> 01:35:15.260
professor of an Ivy League
college instead of a state

01:35:15.260 --> 01:35:15.940
school.

01:35:15.940 --> 01:35:18.540
If you're stuck in an
earlier Kohlbergian stage,

01:35:18.540 --> 01:35:21.380
it's a very abstract
academic measure.

01:35:21.380 --> 01:35:24.140
It is not a predictor
at all over who

01:35:24.140 --> 01:35:28.390
will do the truly brave,
unexpected moral acts.

01:35:28.390 --> 01:35:30.070
So what's of that about?

01:35:30.070 --> 01:35:33.830
That taps into something that I
think we've already alluded to

01:35:33.830 --> 01:35:38.400
in here, which is certain ways
in which information is stored,

01:35:38.400 --> 01:35:40.690
certain places in the
brain that information

01:35:40.690 --> 01:35:43.310
is stored as follows.

01:35:43.310 --> 01:35:46.640
So there is this
dichotomy in sort

01:35:46.640 --> 01:35:49.750
of the neurobiology of
learning between what

01:35:49.750 --> 01:35:54.690
is viewed as explicit
learning and implicit.

01:35:54.690 --> 01:36:00.450
Explicit declarative learning,
implicit procedural learning.

01:36:00.450 --> 01:36:03.890
Explicit declarative
learning is you learn a fact.

01:36:03.890 --> 01:36:05.200
You know a fact.

01:36:05.200 --> 01:36:06.670
You know that the fact.

01:36:06.670 --> 01:36:08.890
You can consciously
make use of the fact

01:36:08.890 --> 01:36:12.170
and strategize and use
it in an executive way.

01:36:12.170 --> 01:36:14.710
Implicit procedural
memory instead

01:36:14.710 --> 01:36:17.480
is stuff that, as always
termed, your hands

01:36:17.480 --> 01:36:19.600
know better than your head does.

01:36:19.600 --> 01:36:22.050
How to do stuff with your hands.

01:36:22.050 --> 01:36:24.840
The other day sort of showing
that in terms of damage

01:36:24.840 --> 01:36:26.510
to the amygdala and
the frontal cortex

01:36:26.510 --> 01:36:28.590
in people with
Alzheimer's disease.

01:36:28.590 --> 01:36:31.760
Explicit declarative
memory goes down the tubes.

01:36:31.760 --> 01:36:33.890
But this is the person
who can still knit.

01:36:33.890 --> 01:36:35.870
This is the person who
could still drive a car.

01:36:35.870 --> 01:36:37.130
Things of that sort.

01:36:37.130 --> 01:36:40.060
Procedural implicit
memory is not

01:36:40.060 --> 01:36:42.330
stored in the
hippocampus and cortex.

01:36:42.330 --> 01:36:46.250
It is predominantly a
phenomenon of the cerebellum.

01:36:46.250 --> 01:36:50.360
So you look at the people
who do the profoundly brave

01:36:50.360 --> 01:36:52.800
stepping out of the crowd steps.

01:36:52.800 --> 01:36:56.670
They're the ones who, regardless
of what their Kohlbergian stage

01:36:56.670 --> 01:36:59.710
might be on their essays that
they write for college finals,

01:36:59.710 --> 01:37:02.310
when you look at the people
who actually do something

01:37:02.310 --> 01:37:06.220
what you see are two factors
that consistently come up.

01:37:06.220 --> 01:37:09.160
And this has mostly been studied
by the Carnegie Foundation

01:37:09.160 --> 01:37:11.270
that every year gives
out awards for the most

01:37:11.270 --> 01:37:12.640
heroic acts of the years.

01:37:12.640 --> 01:37:14.950
And they've actually studied
who these people are,

01:37:14.950 --> 01:37:16.410
what the differences are.

01:37:16.410 --> 01:37:19.390
The first one is that
you have grown up

01:37:19.390 --> 01:37:22.660
with a very strong,
consistent, frequently

01:37:22.660 --> 01:37:27.620
stated imperative to act
morally and to act bravely

01:37:27.620 --> 01:37:30.820
and to not care what
other people think.

01:37:30.820 --> 01:37:32.890
That's the first
thing that you see.

01:37:32.890 --> 01:37:35.410
And the second thing
that always pops up

01:37:35.410 --> 01:37:39.660
is one that is the complete
neurobiological logical outcome

01:37:39.660 --> 01:37:43.170
of that, which is when they
then interview these people

01:37:43.170 --> 01:37:45.610
and say you leapt
out of this crowd

01:37:45.610 --> 01:37:47.240
and ran into this
burning building

01:37:47.240 --> 01:37:49.620
and almost got yourself
killed to save this child who

01:37:49.620 --> 01:37:54.200
you didn't even know, what were
you thinking when you did it?

01:37:54.200 --> 01:37:57.010
And people's answer
is always the same.

01:37:57.010 --> 01:37:58.160
I wasn't thinking.

01:37:58.160 --> 01:37:59.340
I didn't think.

01:37:59.340 --> 01:38:02.220
Before I knew it,
I had run in there.

01:38:02.220 --> 01:38:05.450
Before I knew it, I had
leapt into the river.

01:38:05.450 --> 01:38:06.885
What are we looking at here?

01:38:06.885 --> 01:38:09.830
We are looking at
a moral act not as

01:38:09.830 --> 01:38:12.940
the outcome of your frontal
cortex wrestling you

01:38:12.940 --> 01:38:16.010
into being brave and
moral and all of that.

01:38:16.010 --> 01:38:18.960
You were looking at
an implicit pathway.

01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:21.380
You were looking
at, I didn't think.

01:38:21.380 --> 01:38:24.510
Before I knew it I have
leapt in the river.

01:38:24.510 --> 01:38:27.380
You were looking at what
happens when something is over

01:38:27.380 --> 01:38:29.290
learned during childhood.

01:38:29.290 --> 01:38:32.110
It is not something that you
have to sit and consciously

01:38:32.110 --> 01:38:33.460
wrestle with.

01:38:33.460 --> 01:38:37.150
Fascinating paper a few months
ago from that same Josh Greene

01:38:37.150 --> 01:38:39.230
who did that trolley car study.

01:38:39.230 --> 01:38:43.290
And here what he did was people
were playing some sort of game

01:38:43.290 --> 01:38:44.974
where they had to
predict an outcome

01:38:44.974 --> 01:38:47.140
and they would get a reward
if they predicted right.

01:38:47.140 --> 01:38:50.660
And they set it up in some
totally clever duplicitous way

01:38:50.660 --> 01:38:52.720
so that there would
be periods in the game

01:38:52.720 --> 01:38:55.770
where the person had
the option to cheat.

01:38:55.770 --> 01:38:58.830
And they were able to tell by
the rate at which they were

01:38:58.830 --> 01:39:01.520
suddenly getting better
answers if during these periods

01:39:01.520 --> 01:39:03.930
suddenly they were being
statistically significantly

01:39:03.930 --> 01:39:06.420
more successful
they were cheating.

01:39:06.420 --> 01:39:07.920
And they had them
in a brain scanner

01:39:07.920 --> 01:39:09.860
and were able to see
what was going on.

01:39:09.860 --> 01:39:12.280
So you look at people
who would cheat

01:39:12.280 --> 01:39:14.220
and what happens
when the signal comes

01:39:14.220 --> 01:39:17.030
on indicating that it's one of
these sessions where they could

01:39:17.030 --> 01:39:18.530
get away with cheating.

01:39:18.530 --> 01:39:22.690
Their frontal cortexes
lit up like crazy.

01:39:22.690 --> 01:39:24.200
What were they doing?

01:39:24.200 --> 01:39:26.280
They were wrestling with Satan.

01:39:26.280 --> 01:39:30.230
They were asking those neurons
to do something or other down

01:39:30.230 --> 01:39:33.820
in the amygdala before they did
the wrong thing and the degree

01:39:33.820 --> 01:39:37.380
of frontal activation was not
particularly predictive of who

01:39:37.380 --> 01:39:38.750
actually did cheat.

01:39:38.750 --> 01:39:40.350
You fell into the
cheater category

01:39:40.350 --> 01:39:42.920
if they could show that you ever
cheated during one of these.

01:39:42.920 --> 01:39:44.930
And thus looking at you
the rest of a time when

01:39:44.930 --> 01:39:47.680
you had the opportunity and
didn't, it wasn't particularly

01:39:47.680 --> 01:39:50.000
good predictor of whether
you cheated or not.

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.670
But it was a great
predictor of people who were

01:39:52.670 --> 01:39:55.120
willing to even cheat once.

01:39:55.120 --> 01:39:58.580
So now look at the people
who never ever cheated

01:39:58.580 --> 01:40:00.210
and, of course, one
prediction would

01:40:00.210 --> 01:40:03.050
be that they have
like frontal neurons

01:40:03.050 --> 01:40:06.270
poking out of their head
that are so big and energized

01:40:06.270 --> 01:40:09.770
and their frontal cortex
didn't move an inch.

01:40:09.770 --> 01:40:12.410
When the possibility
of cheating came up,

01:40:12.410 --> 01:40:16.100
there wasn't the remotest
change in frontal activation.

01:40:16.100 --> 01:40:19.220
This was not them wrestling
Satan to the ground.

01:40:19.220 --> 01:40:20.390
It wasn't there.

01:40:20.390 --> 01:40:22.100
There was no temptation.

01:40:22.100 --> 01:40:24.260
It was an implicit pathway.

01:40:24.260 --> 01:40:27.395
It was not sitting there saying,
oh, what if everyone did this?

01:40:27.395 --> 01:40:29.145
And, oh, it's important
that we have laws.

01:40:29.145 --> 01:40:32.900
And, oh, what if I get
punished or-- it is simply,

01:40:32.900 --> 01:40:35.140
before I knew it,
I had jumped in.

01:40:35.140 --> 01:40:36.920
I didn't even think about it.

01:40:36.920 --> 01:40:40.050
What I think this suggests
is awful lot of what

01:40:40.050 --> 01:40:43.480
moral development is about
in the formal stage world

01:40:43.480 --> 01:40:45.310
is what kind of
frontal cortex you're

01:40:45.310 --> 01:40:47.850
going to wind up with
reasoning with your amygdala

01:40:47.850 --> 01:40:49.710
when you look at
the dissociation

01:40:49.710 --> 01:40:52.110
between moral reasoning
and moral behavior

01:40:52.110 --> 01:40:55.240
and the ones who do
the truly brave things,

01:40:55.240 --> 01:40:57.920
it's got nothing to do
with the frontal cortex.

01:40:57.920 --> 01:41:00.250
It's implicit by them.

01:41:00.250 --> 01:41:04.941
So we will pick up
on-- what day is it?

01:41:04.941 --> 01:41:05.440
Wednesday.

01:41:05.440 --> 01:41:07.060
Today's Wednesday?

01:41:07.060 --> 01:41:10.310
