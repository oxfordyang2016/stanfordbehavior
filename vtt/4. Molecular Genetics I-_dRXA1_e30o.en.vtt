00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.940
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:05.855
Stanford University.

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.040
So we pick up from
whatever the last day was.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.100
And we do our first
disciplinary leap

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.630
as promised at the very
beginning of the course.

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.890
The entire function of the
first half of the course

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.890
is to leap from one bucket
to another, such that

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.100
just as soon as you feel
like you are getting mildly

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.120
comfortable in one,
we will spend time

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.560
trashing it from the standpoint
of a different discipline.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.880
This is our first one of these.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.970
And the whole point of this jump
is to show on a certain level

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.310
exactly where one discipline's
the notion of an explanation

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.820
ends, another one begins.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.710
And what this one will be about
is how evolution works down

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.400
on a molecular level.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.340
Where did we leave off
after finishing our overview

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:56.960
of the evolution of behavior?

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.790
We finished with a bunch
of criticisms at the end.

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.490
Criticizing sort of what
some of the basic tenets

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:04.099
were of that view.

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:07.980
First off, that notion
of heritability.

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.970
Heritability-- assuming
that all sorts of behaviors

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.190
have a genetic component,
have a genetic basis,

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:15.520
have a genetic cause.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.100
And we will see those are worlds
of differences in those words

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.600
there.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.890
And what we saw was that
that could be the case.

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.050
That could not be the case.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.090
That's going to be what we
focus on a great deal today.

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.830
Another one of
the basic tenets--

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.190
this notion of adaptation.

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.690
Everything you see is
wonderfully adaptive.

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.330
The outcome is
exactly the process

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.290
that evolution brings
about to optimize results.

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.140
The counter view being the
world of spandrels-- a lot

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.040
of the time, stuff gets
carried along as baggage.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.900
Things evolving aren't
necessarily things

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.030
that have been sculpted into
being as adaptive as possible.

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.180
Another critique, and one
that's also central today,

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.810
is that whole emphasis
on the gradualism,

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.560
on small incremental changes.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.300
And what I alluded to
at the end the other day

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.139
is going to see
a viewpoint where

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:13.870
something very, very different
is proposed to be going on.

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.310
One that will make sense
only eventually when

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.930
we see some pretty unexpected
things about genetics

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.050
and the molecular biology of.

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.910
OK, so starting off--
what we also finished with

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.550
was a notion that there
are political agendas that

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.080
run through every
aspect of this subject.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.640
And if that very
first lecture, back

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.410
when talking about how some of
these viewpoints influence who

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.810
gets a lobotomy, who
winds up exterminated,

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.990
who winds up being viewed as
educatable or uneducatable,

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.070
et cetera, polypolitical views
run throughout all of this

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.600
you will see very
strongly in this realm.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.100
OK.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.870
So that viewpoint of
the sociobiologists,

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.130
the evolutionary
psychologists the other day,

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.430
one of the tenets going after
the notion of heritability.

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.790
The notion that these
behaviors are heritable,

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.610
or are genetically
influenced, blah, blah.

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.670
How would folks in
that business do it?

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.120
What they would do is
exactly what we were saying.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.020
Which is say, OK, here's
some behavioral structure.

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.410
And we know how evolution works,
and evolution of behavior,

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.530
and individual selection,
and kin selection,

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.310
and reciprocal
altruism, and evolution

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:26.390
of, and all the above.

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.310
And then they say, Well, with
that framework, that explains

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.750
the behavior pretty well.

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.520
Go show me something better.

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.090
Show me a better
theoretical structure

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.810
that's even more
explanatory, more predictive.

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.409
And until you come up
with something better,

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:44.200
I'm going to assume
that this one is right.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.930
And this one comes with
a larger assumption

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.990
of heritability of genetics
all built around inferentially.

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:54.140
These are highly
structured models

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.380
built around how genes work.

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.890
They explain what we see
with these behaviors.

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.500
And until you can give me a
model that does even a better

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.830
job, I'm sticking
with this, and this

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:07.350
counts as my evidence
for a genetic component

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.730
to this set of behaviors.

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.170
And what we'll see is
that's exactly where

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.110
the molecular biologists
decide that they finally

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:19.589
have gotten free of
people doing poetry

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:20.829
for all the science in it.

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:23.720
My god, that counts as science?

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.160
Coming up with a
bunch of these rules

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.140
there and saying until you come
up with fancier rules or a more

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.670
pleasing just so story, I win?

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:33.230
That counts as science?

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:35.610
Complete contempt
for this approach.

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.200
This is where more molecular
stance about it all takes off.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.600
And what we'll see
that that not only will

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.010
have lots to say
about adaptiveness,

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:48.310
it will also have lots
to say about gradualism.

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.160
So starting with it.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.700
In order to make sense of
this, for a molecular biologist

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.450
what is evolution about?

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:58.560
When you see traits that have
evolved, what's it about?

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.250
By necessity, what one is
immediately talking about

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:03.380
is genes.

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:06.560
Genes in this case
not as some constructs

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.340
that one wants to maximize
copies of and ones

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.570
that your cousins have
only whatever percentage

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:16.280
of in common with you, but
genes instead molecules.

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.230
Genes as information,
genes as strings of DNA.

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:24.080
And I'll assume by now there's
like a basic level of shared

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.650
knowledge about this after
hearing that a lot of folks

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:28.960
came to the catchup session
last week, which I think

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.310
is a good idea.

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:34.740
But what it's all built about,
all of this notion of genes,

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.350
eventually way out the
other end having something

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:41.500
to do with behavior, is the
intermediary of proteins.

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.390
Proteins are important.

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:45.090
Proteins are important
not just to have

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:49.510
in your diet to make you run
fast, and strong, and all.

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:53.950
Proteins are, in lots of ways,
the structurally most important

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:55.960
things you've got
making up cells.

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.720
Proteins have endless roles.

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.520
Proteins hold the shapes
of cells together.

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.380
Proteins form
messengers, hormones,

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:07.230
neurotransmitters,
all of this to come.

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:10.270
Proteins are the enzymes
that do all sorts

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:11.900
of the most important stuff.

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:13.940
Proteins, et cetera,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.260
Proteins are the
workhorses of what

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.730
have cells doing what
they're supposed to do.

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:21.930
So the question
of course becomes

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:23.850
what codes for proteins?

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:25.870
And this is where genes come in.

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:31.730
Our basic issue here is this
flow of information-- genes

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:34.250
specify proteins.

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:38.160
Proteins are made up of
constituent building blocks,

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:39.380
amino acids.

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:41.330
There's approximately
20 different ones

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:42.710
that are commonly occurring.

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:46.590
And each one has to be coded
for with a different DNA

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:50.300
sequence, a different
DNA sequence of three

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:53.070
letters, three nucleotides.

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:55.990
And I hope I'm not hitting
the level here where people

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:58.120
for whom this is new this
is going way too fast

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.470
and everybody else
this is way too boring.

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:03.790
But hang on for a
while in that case.

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:09.680
So DNA codes for amino acids.

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:13.290
A long string of DNA coding
for a sequence of them

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:16.080
will code for a
sequence of amino acids

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:20.060
which get plugged together,
and you then have a protein.

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:23.970
You've got one intervening
step, which for our purposes

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:26.190
is like not really interesting.

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:28.180
And we could ignore
it for the most part.

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:30.480
Which is, there's an
intermediary step--

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:34.300
genes at the level of
DNA, sequences of DNA,

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:38.530
first specify an
intermediate form called RNA.

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:41.620
And it's from that that
you get the readout forming

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:43.360
the proteins.

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.840
Now, everything about
the function of this

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:48.570
is built out of the
following sequence.

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:52.000
If you know the
sequence of DNA, you

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.250
will know the sequence of RNA.

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:56.970
You will know the
amino acid sequence.

00:07:56.970 --> 00:08:00.270
You will know the protein
that thus is made.

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:02.830
You will know the
shape of the protein.

00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:06.080
And you will then know the
function of the protein.

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:10.590
And that is this critical
link between what DNA, genes,

00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:12.640
evolution, blah,
blah, are about,

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:15.325
and the actual things that
pop out at the other end

00:08:15.325 --> 00:08:16.660
and do something.

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:19.330
For the very critical
reason that everything

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:23.130
about protein function
is built round shape.

00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:26.310
Here is a cliche that
is required by law

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:27.710
to be said at this point.

00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:30.540
Which is, all sorts
of effector proteins

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:33.250
fit into other molecules,
other effector proteins.

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:35.753
Like a-- OK, everybody
say it out loud.

00:08:35.753 --> 00:08:36.919
Everybody knows this cliche.

00:08:36.919 --> 00:08:38.120
It fits in like a--

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:39.370
Glove.

00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:39.940
Yes.

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:41.429
OK.

00:08:41.429 --> 00:08:43.320
Cliched education at its best.

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:45.100
Like a lock and key
for those of you

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:47.730
who are not tortured with
this one from early on.

00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:51.980
It's the whole notion that
a shape of a protein imparts

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:54.440
information insofar
as it interacts

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:58.140
with something else of a
shape which modifies it,

00:08:58.140 --> 00:08:59.880
which complements it, whatever.

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:04.000
The whole world that we will
have of various hormones

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.290
and neurotransmitters
will consist

00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:09.090
of hormones and
neurotransmitters going

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:12.680
into receptors where there
is a critical relationship

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:15.860
in the shape between the
messenger and the receptor.

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:19.040
And all of this is
driven by proteins,

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:20.700
protein shape, et cetera.

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:25.060
All of this is driven
thus by DNA sequences.

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:27.850
Shape is everything with this.

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:29.480
What you get from
that is, of course,

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:32.180
the question of where do you
get different shapes from?

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:35.670
And those 20 amino
acids, for our purposes,

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:37.120
for the purposes
especially people

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:39.060
without a strong
chemistry background,

00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:43.300
all that's pertinent here is
the 20 different amino acids

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:46.600
have different degrees
of being attracted to

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:49.030
or repelled by water.

00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:51.490
Which, most proteins are
spending their life swimming

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:52.490
around in water.

00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:54.110
They are pulled towards water.

00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:54.860
They avoid it.

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:56.790
They are hydrophilic,
hydrophobic.

00:09:56.790 --> 00:10:00.310
All that means is
different amino acids gets

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:04.160
pulled into different
positions by their relationship

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:04.670
with water.

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:06.930
And thus, a string
of amino acids,

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:08.980
the shape it winds
up getting with,

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:12.490
is determined by that
amino acid sequence.

00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:15.370
There is a whole world
of really interesting

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:17.490
horrible neurological
diseases called

00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:20.030
prion diseases which show
that everything I just said

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:20.530
is wrong.

00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:23.370
But for our purposes,
everything I just said is right.

00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:26.500
So this is where you get
this critical relationship.

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:28.260
Know the DNA sequence.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:29.850
Know the coding.

00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:33.880
And out the other end, you
will get protein shape because

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:36.290
of this business of
different amino acids

00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:38.260
having different
relationships with water

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:39.880
and thus strings
of them coming up

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:42.390
with different three
dimensional structures.

00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:45.550
And out of that will
be coming function out

00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:49.370
of the famed lock and key nature
between shapes of functions

00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:51.030
and shapes of other things.

00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:56.860
Just once again for people
fairly new at this-- nope.

00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:58.640
No diagram there.

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:04.217
One of the most interesting--
or the blank slate.

00:11:04.217 --> 00:11:06.300
One of the most interesting
things the proteins do

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:08.290
is when they are enzymes.

00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:11.120
Everybody knows that enzymes are
important because they put them

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:14.010
in your laundry
detergent, and advertise

00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:17.810
about how cool it is that you
have enzymes in your detergent.

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:23.190
But what enzymes do is
they catalyze reactions.

00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:26.810
They cause reactions to
occur which left on their own

00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:28.990
would be very, very rare events.

00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:32.800
What enzymes do is
accelerate vastly--

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:37.220
a gazillion times over-- the
speed with which these happen.

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:38.930
Catalyze reactions.

00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:40.490
What do I mean by that?

00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:43.180
For our purposes, they
can take two things

00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:45.860
that aren't connected
and stick them together.

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:48.870
Or they can take one
thing and break it apart.

00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:51.260
For our purposes,
that's what enzymes do.

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:54.980
Virtually every enzyme
out there is a protein.

00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:59.120
So proteins fit into other
things and send on messages.

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:00.500
Proteins are enzymes.

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:02.840
Pull things together,
pull them apart.

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:04.710
Proteins are structural.

00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:08.030
Again, a whole lot of the
superstructure of your cells

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:09.950
are held together by proteins.

00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:12.920
This is the realm
of what they do.

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:18.570
Notice here, suddenly there is
a change of shape in a protein

00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:19.960
if it's an enzyme.

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:20.960
Because what's it doing?

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:24.980
In some way, it's got to
be pulling apart something

00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:26.850
or putting something together.

00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:29.510
The shape, in some
cases, also can

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:32.080
change as a function
of what this protein is

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:33.290
doing with its job.

00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:37.310
We will see a classic
version of that are channels.

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:41.040
Channels in which chemicals
can flow in or out of cells.

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:43.080
Ions, for chemistry types.

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:46.330
Channels that will open up
under some circumstances,

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:47.660
close under others.

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:50.940
So protein structure not only
gives shape and function,

00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:55.080
but it gives the circumstances
where the shape might change

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:57.960
in a functionally relevant way.

00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:02.580
So out of all of this comes
of the central dogma of life.

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:06.530
And this was proposed by Francis
Crick of Watson and Crick fame.

00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:08.110
And Francis Crick
was the one who

00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:11.710
formalized saying the
central dogma of how

00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:17.390
life and information flows
is DNA to RNA to protein.

00:13:17.390 --> 00:13:19.120
And that became defining.

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:22.760
An entire generation of babies
were told that at birth.

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:24.350
This is the flow of information.

00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:26.350
It has been violated
in all sorts

00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:29.840
of interesting ways, which will
dominate a lot of what comes.

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:32.790
But this was the central dogma.

00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:34.940
One way in which
it is violated--

00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:37.740
and again, this notion
is not DNA to RNA,

00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:42.360
but the notion of whatever
your DNA sequence is, whatever

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:46.280
the gene is, whatever
structure of a protein

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:48.760
it codes for-- the
flow of information

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:52.450
is going to be from
DNA, RNA, to protein.

00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:54.730
DNA as running everything.

00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:58.330
Note the importance of that
in the very statement of this

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:01.690
as the central dogma, the
canonical flow of information

00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:02.220
in life.

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:04.520
It all starts with DNA.

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:08.870
DNA is the one sitting here
deciding when information is

00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:11.920
going to flow from DNA to RNA.

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:14.740
DNA as knowing what's happening.

00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:18.660
And a lot of what we will see
shortly is DNA knows squat.

00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:21.930
DNA is not making a whole
lot of decisions there.

00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:24.690
The one simplistic way in
which central dogma went down

00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:28.600
the tubes in the
1970s or so, and one

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:31.370
that's tangential here,
but just as a first blow

00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:33.010
against central dogma.

00:14:33.010 --> 00:14:34.510
One of the things
that's interesting

00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:37.000
is there are things
called viruses.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.130
And what viruses do for a
living is get into organisms.

00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:44.950
Viruses, in the classical
form, being little smidgens

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:50.710
of foreign DNA which are able
to get into the DNA of your own,

00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:53.790
hijack the processes
there, and make the cell

00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:57.050
function for its own
parasitic, vicious needs.

00:14:57.050 --> 00:15:01.090
And so you are changing
the starting step of how

00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:02.910
the central dogma of life.

00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:05.660
And thus you're going to change
RNA and protein, all of that.

00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:07.800
In the '70s, it
became apparent there

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:12.260
was one weirdo viral
world of viruses made out

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:15.870
of RNA, this intermediate form.

00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:19.140
All sorts of people were
extremely upset about this

00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:21.210
and tried to ostracize
the scientists who

00:15:21.210 --> 00:15:23.620
came up with this and
told them there's no way.

00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:26.510
But eventually, what
was shown in Nobel Prize

00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:30.650
winning glory was there's
a class of enzymes.

00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:32.070
Enzymes-- they pop up.

00:15:32.070 --> 00:15:35.610
A class of enzymes that could
take the RNA information

00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:39.140
and turn it back into
DNA, viral information.

00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:40.370
And then it does its thing.

00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:42.390
Huge blow to the central.

00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:47.960
Here's information running
from an RNA virus somehow being

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:50.780
reversed back to a DNA form.

00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:54.200
And thus these are
called retro viruses.

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:57.030
Inserting the DNA, and
off they go from there.

00:15:57.030 --> 00:15:58.330
So this was a major blow.

00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:00.330
Everybody eventually
came to terms with this.

00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:04.900
But it still is a minor
footnote in this Crickian world

00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:07.460
of everything flows from DNA.

00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:08.650
It is the Bible.

00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:09.870
It is the law giver.

00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:11.490
It is the holy grail.

00:16:11.490 --> 00:16:13.630
It is where it all starts.

00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:15.620
So stay tuned.

00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:18.530
So given that framework,
one should immediately

00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:22.030
get mighty impressed with
what if something changes

00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:23.050
in the DNA?

00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:27.550
What if one of the bits of
coding is coded incorrectly?

00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:31.240
What if we now have on
our hands a mutation?

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:35.220
And what we'll focus on
here is classical realms

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:38.460
of mutation, and
genetics, and how

00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:42.870
that plays out in
classical, gradualist models

00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:46.520
of evolutionary change, and
then see how all of that

00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:49.370
falls apart when you look
at what's really going on.

00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:51.457
So starting off,
what you can have--

00:16:51.457 --> 00:16:53.540
and again, this is going
to be a review for people

00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:55.170
with a background in this.

00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:58.220
Newcomers to this-- hopefully
this won't be going too fast.

00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:00.080
But broadly when
you were talking

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:03.290
about this world
of micromutations,

00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:06.569
for our purposes what we
will mean by a micromutation

00:17:06.569 --> 00:17:11.490
is when one letter in your
DNA sequence of information

00:17:11.490 --> 00:17:14.140
gets accidentally miscopied.

00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:17.420
Or it gets changed by radiation.

00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:20.880
Or it gets changed by
some chemical compound

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:21.650
the environment.

00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:24.349
Some such thing where
there's a mistake and one

00:17:24.349 --> 00:17:29.340
letter in the DNA
sequence comes up wrong.

00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:33.965
As I noted before,
pairs of triplets.

00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:41.550
And there we've got
three pairs of triplets.

00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:45.130
And what we've got here
is at the DNA level,

00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:50.830
a amino acid is coded
for by three base pairs.

00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:52.540
A triplet-- three of these.

00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:54.070
Next amino acid coded for.

00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:55.420
Next one coded for.

00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:59.060
So what we've just raised is
the possibility of a mutation

00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:03.480
occurring, something
changing in one single one,

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:05.310
and now asking what
are the consequences

00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:09.180
going to be in classical
realms of genetics

00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:10.870
and evolutionary change?

00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:13.060
Broadly, you can get
three different versions

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:14.670
of stuff going wrong.

00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:18.950
One is where one
of these letters--

00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:22.310
nucleotides, translating; not
essential to have that down--

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:24.300
where one of these
letters is accidentally

00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:30.090
changed into another
letter-- a point mutation.

00:18:30.090 --> 00:18:35.260
In some cases, point mutations
are of no consequence at all.

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:37.160
How can that be?

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:40.660
For this very simple reason,
going through some math here,

00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:43.050
there are four different
potential letters

00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:44.530
at each one of these sites.

00:18:44.530 --> 00:18:48.080
DNA comes in four different
letter types, letter flavors,

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:50.300
four different types of bases.

00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:52.480
And thus, you can have
four different ones

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:54.960
in the first
position times four,

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:59.780
times fourr-- a total of
64 possible three-step

00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:02.290
combinations of DNA letters.

00:19:02.290 --> 00:19:05.320
A possibility of 64
of them, and you're

00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:07.920
only coding for 20 amino acids.

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:11.200
So you use up some
of the 64 for signals

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:14.800
saying stop or start, or
thank god it's Friday,

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:16.130
or who knows what.

00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:19.440
But what you have, though,
is a large redundancy.

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:23.230
You have a number of
different triplet sequences

00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:26.250
coding for the same amino acid.

00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:29.670
There's redundancy
in the genetic code.

00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:32.610
And in general, where
you get that redundancy,

00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:36.880
where you get the differences
in three triplets, a couple

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:39.920
of different triplets that
code for the same amino acid,

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:43.250
they'll tend to differ in
the middle one of the three

00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:44.040
letters.

00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:47.350
That's the easiest one to have
a change where it doesn't change

00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:49.600
the overall consequence of it.

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:52.220
So you will tend
to have redundancy.

00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:57.010
Each amino acid is
coded for by a number

00:19:57.010 --> 00:19:59.500
of closely-related triplets.

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:04.190
So first possible type of
mutation-- this point mutation

00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:07.110
where one letter is
flipped to another.

00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:10.940
Potentially, this could be
of no consequence whatsoever.

00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:15.270
If you flipped to a letter
out of the middle one,

00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:17.550
which happens to leave you
with a triplet that codes

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:20.430
for the same amino acid.

00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:22.940
In that case, you have
a neutral mutation

00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:25.700
of zero consequence whatsoever.

00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:28.581
So that's not a very
exciting mutation.

00:20:28.581 --> 00:20:29.080
In

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:31.210
Some cases, you can
have a single point

00:20:31.210 --> 00:20:35.600
being changed where you wind
up with a different amino acid

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:36.600
coded for.

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:40.250
And that's most typically, if
it's a mutation in here or here

00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:42.040
rather than the
boring middle one,

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:43.870
you get a different amino acid.

00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:45.380
Is that the end of the world?

00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:48.720
Often not at all
or only minimally

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:52.560
because a lot of the amino
acids have similar feelings

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:55.560
and ambivalences about
water, similar responses

00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:56.830
and similar shapes.

00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:58.790
It won't be exactly
the same shape,

00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:01.460
but the protein will
function somewhat the same.

00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:04.330
So you could have, in this
case, a point mutation

00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:07.610
and most people would
not find the second line

00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:10.270
to be impossible to make
sense of in the context

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:12.170
of the first one.

00:21:12.170 --> 00:21:15.290
Or you could have a
point mutation which,

00:21:15.290 --> 00:21:18.220
by changing one letter,
produces a different amino acid,

00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:20.140
and this one is
majorly different.

00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:22.850
This one has a
completely different set

00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:24.930
of attractions or being
repelled by water.

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:29.220
Produces a protein of a very
different shape and potentially

00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:31.870
a very different message.

00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:35.240
And shown here, just changing
one letter in this case, one

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:37.310
single point mutation,
and you dramatically

00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:38.730
change the meaning of that.

00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:41.450
And I actually did that
once in the grant proposal.

00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:44.550
Sort of the final paragraph--
we have now accomplished

00:21:44.550 --> 00:21:47.340
x, y, and z with your money
over the last five years.

00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:49.400
And no wonder it
didn't get renewed.

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:52.230
So in that case, you see
a single point mutation

00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:53.700
of great consequence.

00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:55.930
So you can have one
of these letters,

00:21:55.930 --> 00:21:59.550
one of these nucleotide
mistaken for another-- entirely

00:21:59.550 --> 00:22:01.860
neutral, moderate
consequence, or

00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:04.030
major, disastrous consequence.

00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:06.860
Second way of
classical mutations,

00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:08.610
the second version
that it could come with

00:22:08.610 --> 00:22:10.740
is there is a deletion.

00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:14.330
One of the letters gets
lost in the process.

00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:18.850
And what you then get is a frame
shift over to the missing spot

00:22:18.850 --> 00:22:19.350
there.

00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:21.820
And the D from here
now finishes up this.

00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:23.440
And what you can
see is it suddenly

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:25.240
becomes dramatic jibberish.

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:27.120
And it would continue that way.

00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:30.880
A deletion mutation,
in classical genetics,

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:32.440
is major league.

00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:37.030
It totally changes the
coding downstream from that.

00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:40.910
Third classical type--
an insertion mutation.

00:22:40.910 --> 00:22:45.610
One where you now accidentally
double the letter,

00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:49.500
and you're frame shifted
in the opposite direction.

00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:51.860
Just as screwing up of meaning.

00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:53.750
Major consequences there.

00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:56.000
So you have point
mutations, which

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.920
can have major consequences,
or can have none whatsoever,

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:01.160
and anything in between.

00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:03.140
You have point
mutations, and then you

00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:04.570
have insertion and deletion.

00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:07.430
The last two tend to
have big consequences.

00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:13.320
So all of this is built around
one single base pair change.

00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:18.010
And all of this is built
around thus one single protein

00:23:18.010 --> 00:23:19.710
changing its shape.

00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:23.680
And thus, this world of
micromutation-- single spots

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:25.830
that are mutating--
what this tends to do,

00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:29.330
and this is an important
concept for what's to come,

00:23:29.330 --> 00:23:34.220
what it does is it changes how
well the protein does its job.

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:41.970
It changes the efficacy
of that protein

00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:43.740
by changing the
shape a little bit,

00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:45.890
by changing it
dramatically, all of that.

00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:51.210
And we can see back
to our lock and key

00:23:51.210 --> 00:23:54.020
where if, thanks
to a mutation, this

00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:58.400
has a slightly different shade,
it will fit into the lock

00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:00.020
slightly less effectively.

00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:02.560
It may stay in there
for a shorter time

00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:06.894
before floating off and
thus send less of a message.

00:24:06.894 --> 00:24:09.310
On the other hand, if you've
got a deletion insertion that

00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:11.350
dramatically changes
the shape of this,

00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:14.204
you will change how well
this protein does its job.

00:24:14.204 --> 00:24:15.870
It won't do its job
at all, because it's

00:24:15.870 --> 00:24:17.953
going to wind up with a
completely different shape

00:24:17.953 --> 00:24:19.370
and not fit in there whatsoever.

00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:22.200
What we have here is
a world of mutations

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:28.270
which are changing the function
of one protein at a time.

00:24:28.270 --> 00:24:31.840
That is
microevolutionary change,

00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:34.910
and that's what we're now
going to see played out.

00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:36.780
When can this make a difference?

00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:39.180
This can make huge
differences when

00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:42.080
it's in the realm where, thanks
to a change in the shape,

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:44.670
the protein is completely
out of business.

00:24:44.670 --> 00:24:47.670
Two examples-- one where
you take out the function

00:24:47.670 --> 00:24:49.390
of the preexisting gene.

00:24:49.390 --> 00:24:53.570
First one-- there
is this amino acid.

00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:56.050
For our purposes, that's
going to derail us.

00:24:56.050 --> 00:24:58.700
For our purposes,
there's a chemical

00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:02.260
that occurs in the body
called phenylalanine,

00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:03.840
which has its uses.

00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:05.650
But you don't want
the levels of it

00:25:05.650 --> 00:25:09.010
to build up too high, because
it can become toxic, damaging

00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:11.310
to brain cells, to neurons.

00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:15.270
And fortunately,
there is an enzyme

00:25:15.270 --> 00:25:18.840
made of protein which turns
phenylalanine into something

00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:19.530
safer.

00:25:19.530 --> 00:25:21.480
That's all we need
to know about it.

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:27.260
So you have a mutation in the
gene coding for that enzyme.

00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:29.590
Not a fancy mutation
to something.

00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:33.100
One of these categories--
a classical, single spot

00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:34.620
point mutation.

00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:37.480
And what you got there
is an enzyme that

00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:39.800
no longer does its job.

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:42.440
And as a result,
this phenylalanine

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:44.730
is not converted
into the safer form,

00:25:44.730 --> 00:25:47.970
builds up, and lays waste
to one's nervous system.

00:25:47.970 --> 00:25:52.330
And thus you have a disease--
PKU, phenylketonuria.

00:25:52.330 --> 00:25:55.340
Very, very common
genetic disorder.

00:25:55.340 --> 00:26:00.130
And this is one where the
outcome is a small mutation

00:26:00.130 --> 00:26:03.140
that has completely knocked
this enzyme out of business--

00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:05.330
this enzyme which
was able to turn

00:26:05.330 --> 00:26:08.130
the phenylalanine
into something safer.

00:26:08.130 --> 00:26:10.050
This is not a subtle outcome.

00:26:10.050 --> 00:26:14.120
Have untreated PKU, and
your reproductive success

00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:15.610
by the rules of
evolution is going

00:26:15.610 --> 00:26:17.510
to be real down near zero.

00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:21.420
This destroys the nervous
system very rapidly after birth.

00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:23.290
So that's dramatic.

00:26:23.290 --> 00:26:24.949
Here's another dramatic one.

00:26:24.949 --> 00:26:26.615
And this one-- anyone
who took BIO CORE,

00:26:26.615 --> 00:26:30.950
I always bring this one in as
a big hormone crowd pleaser.

00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:33.060
But here's an
interesting thing that

00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:37.160
can go wrong with any child
you might eventually have.

00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:40.940
You've got a daughter,
and she's doing just fine.

00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:44.130
And she's growing up just
fine, and things are terrific.

00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:49.330
And around age 10, or 11, or
so, some of her classmates

00:26:49.330 --> 00:26:51.190
are beginning to reach puberty.

00:26:51.190 --> 00:26:54.150
That's on the early side
for the Western average,

00:26:54.150 --> 00:26:55.640
but it's not outrageously early.

00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:56.640
Not a big deal.

00:26:56.640 --> 00:27:02.160
By about 12, statistically about
half of the girls in her class

00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:03.210
have reached puberty.

00:27:03.210 --> 00:27:05.800
12 is about the Westernized
average these days.

00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:06.730
She hasn't yet.

00:27:06.730 --> 00:27:07.820
Not a big deal.

00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:09.719
A year later, she still hasn't.

00:27:09.719 --> 00:27:12.260
Well, this is nothing critical,
but it's getting a little bit

00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:13.150
on the late side.

00:27:13.150 --> 00:27:15.500
A year after that, two
years after that, she

00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:17.550
has still not reached puberty.

00:27:17.550 --> 00:27:20.710
So at that point, you
take her to a physician

00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:25.000
who examines her closely
and figures out what's up.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.280
And at some point, the
physician is probably

00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:30.000
going to have pupils
dilate, or some sort

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.180
of weird autonomic response,
when they figure out what's up.

00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:37.010
And then very calmly,
in a premeditated way,

00:27:37.010 --> 00:27:39.060
sit you down for a
little talk afterward,

00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:41.290
and inform you that
your daughter has not

00:27:41.290 --> 00:27:43.604
started menstruating, has
not reached puberty yet.

00:27:43.604 --> 00:27:45.770
Your daughter has not started
to do this because you

00:27:45.770 --> 00:27:47.220
don't have a daughter.

00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:48.850
You've got a son.

00:27:48.850 --> 00:27:51.760
This kid here for
these last 14 years

00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:54.890
has actually been
male, not female.

00:27:54.890 --> 00:27:57.700
You have what is called-- no,
I'm not going to tell you it.

00:27:57.700 --> 00:28:00.720
OK, it's called-- especially
since it's in the handout

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:02.760
already-- anyone want to
guess what it's called?

00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:06.860
It's called TFM, Testicular
Feminization Syndrome.

00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:10.300
And you wind up with a
testicular feminized male.

00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:15.680
These are individuals who,
genetically, are male.

00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:19.710
At the level of chromosomes,
that XX and XY business,

00:28:19.710 --> 00:28:22.790
these are individuals
who have testes.

00:28:22.790 --> 00:28:26.420
Testes way up in their
stomach or whatever, never

00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:28.150
descended down.

00:28:28.150 --> 00:28:32.270
These are people whose
testes make testosterone.

00:28:32.270 --> 00:28:34.370
Testosterone out the wazoo.

00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:36.190
Tons of testosterone.

00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:39.500
Enough testosterone to put
like antlers on your testes,

00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:40.340
or something.

00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:41.810
That much testosterone.

00:28:41.810 --> 00:28:46.100
And nonetheless, you're
getting a female phenotype.

00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:49.180
You are getting a female
external genitalia.

00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:50.890
You are getting
female everything.

00:28:50.890 --> 00:28:51.810
Yup, question?

00:28:51.810 --> 00:28:55.240
Sorry, is that different
than androgyne insensitivity?

00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:57.430
No, that's the
fancy term for it.

00:28:57.430 --> 00:29:00.700
And you've just given away
the punchline, you creep.

00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:02.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:07.340
So they figured out in
this disease there's

00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:10.030
an insensitivity to something.

00:29:10.030 --> 00:29:11.490
What could that be?

00:29:11.490 --> 00:29:12.990
OK, go and say it again.

00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:14.780
Yes, OK.

00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:18.430
What you've got here is one of
those simple little classical

00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:19.510
mutations.

00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:23.040
And what it does is it changed
the shape of the androgen

00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:25.570
receptor, the
testosterone receptor.

00:29:25.570 --> 00:29:28.390
And at that point it doesn't
matter how much testosterone

00:29:28.390 --> 00:29:32.710
is floating around, those target
cells are not going to listen.

00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:34.700
This is consequential.

00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:36.690
This is a major consequence.

00:29:36.690 --> 00:29:39.270
This is one of changing
gender phenotype,

00:29:39.270 --> 00:29:42.760
and there is a long and at
times absolutely appalling

00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:46.200
history of what has been
done with individuals

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:49.620
who have Testicular
Feminization Syndrome, what

00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:52.890
counts as the medically
appropriate intervention.

00:29:52.890 --> 00:29:54.990
There's some horrifying
history there

00:29:54.990 --> 00:29:57.990
that could be straight out
of the first lecture in terms

00:29:57.990 --> 00:30:01.890
of some notions of what counts
as normal gender behavior.

00:30:01.890 --> 00:30:03.620
Another version of
this-- this one's

00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:05.830
a little bit more subtle
because in this case,

00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:08.780
it's not wiping out the
function of an enzyme.

00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:12.570
It's just making it a little bit
less effective at what it does.

00:30:12.570 --> 00:30:14.950
And this has to do
with a disease that

00:30:14.950 --> 00:30:18.380
is found in two different
populations, slight variants

00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:18.920
on it.

00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:22.090
One is up in the Dominican
Republic, in the mountains.

00:30:22.090 --> 00:30:24.440
The other is in the
mountains of New Guinea.

00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:26.930
Interesting similarity there.

00:30:26.930 --> 00:30:31.010
In both cases, some fairly
isolated, inbred populations.

00:30:31.010 --> 00:30:34.420
So that has genetics
written all over it.

00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:37.520
But in these cases, there
is a problem with enzymes

00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:40.690
that make testosterone.

00:30:40.690 --> 00:30:42.490
So this is a whole other world.

00:30:42.490 --> 00:30:46.270
Instead of the enzyme, instead
of the proteins, and thus

00:30:46.270 --> 00:30:48.700
the gene somewhere
back there, that code

00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:51.650
for the receptor
for testosterone,

00:30:51.650 --> 00:30:55.340
the receptor that responds
to this messenger,

00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:58.032
here instead it's back way
up there in the testes.

00:30:58.032 --> 00:31:00.490
A bunch of these enzymes, which
go through a bunch of steps

00:31:00.490 --> 00:31:04.910
and make testosterone,
biosynthetic enzymes there.

00:31:04.910 --> 00:31:06.600
Proteins, genes, once again.

00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:10.540
So you've got a mutation in one
of those critical, biosynthetic

00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:11.400
enzymes.

00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:14.050
And It's not a huge one.

00:31:14.050 --> 00:31:15.660
The shape is a little bit off.

00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:18.650
Its efficacy, the
effectiveness with which

00:31:18.650 --> 00:31:20.950
it makes testosterone
is down a bit--

00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:23.020
and actually it's
down a lot-- so here's

00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:24.840
what you wind up getting.

00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:29.180
You get an individual
who before puberty has

00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:32.070
extremely low
testosterone levels, even

00:31:32.070 --> 00:31:35.041
far lower than you would see
in prepubescent males in most

00:31:35.041 --> 00:31:35.540
cases.

00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:37.000
Someone who's genetically male.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.890
Someone who never saw a
whole lot of testosterone

00:31:39.890 --> 00:31:42.870
during fetal life, way
below the threshold

00:31:42.870 --> 00:31:46.140
for the testosterone
having any effects.

00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:49.420
So the person is born
phenotypically female.

00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:50.880
Female in appearance.

00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:53.540
Female in external genitalia.

00:31:53.540 --> 00:31:57.140
And not internal-- back to those
testicular feminized males.

00:31:57.140 --> 00:32:01.630
What you find there is a
vagina which goes nowhere,

00:32:01.630 --> 00:32:04.760
because there's no ovaries
waiting somewhere above that.

00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:05.760
There is the testes.

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:07.970
But the external
genitalia is just fine.

00:32:07.970 --> 00:32:12.230
What I think these days is
the most common medical ethics

00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:16.360
advice and what's done with that
is the physician explains what

00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:19.310
it is and says, For
all practical purposes,

00:32:19.310 --> 00:32:21.600
you have a daughter who
is perfectly healthy,

00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:23.830
who's going to have a
long, happy, healthy life,

00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:25.590
and simply cannot reproduce.

00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:28.460
That's the only consequence
that's relevant here.

00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:30.580
And there's been a
whole other world

00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:35.460
of reconstructive surgery, and
all sorts of very interesting,

00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:36.850
horrifying history.

00:32:36.850 --> 00:32:38.010
So back to this one.

00:32:38.010 --> 00:32:41.057
Because of the extremely
low testosterone levels,

00:32:41.057 --> 00:32:42.890
because at the time of
life when there's not

00:32:42.890 --> 00:32:45.410
a whole lot of testosterone
around in the fetus,

00:32:45.410 --> 00:32:48.715
in a young male, and now
it's below the threshold

00:32:48.715 --> 00:32:49.590
for causing anything.

00:32:49.590 --> 00:32:52.990
Along comes puberty, and thanks
to a whole bunch of changes

00:32:52.990 --> 00:32:56.600
in the brain, signals go out
so that testosterone levels now

00:32:56.600 --> 00:33:01.090
come roaring up into the usual,
impossible levels in the males.

00:33:01.090 --> 00:33:04.220
And what happens
here is the levels

00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:06.170
don't go up as much
as they should,

00:33:06.170 --> 00:33:09.380
because that enzyme is a
little bit on the slow side.

00:33:09.380 --> 00:33:12.330
But they go up enough
to pass threshold

00:33:12.330 --> 00:33:14.260
for beginning to have an effect.

00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:16.870
And somewhere right
around puberty,

00:33:16.870 --> 00:33:19.140
this individual changes sex.

00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:23.790
This individual
transfers, transmits,

00:33:23.790 --> 00:33:27.160
jumps ship and goes
from female to male

00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:30.040
as a result of these androgenic
effects suddenly coming in.

00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:32.330
It's not a complete
switch there,

00:33:32.330 --> 00:33:33.990
but it's somewhat
of a transition.

00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:35.560
This is bizarre.

00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:37.900
Again, this is not
something subtle.

00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:40.050
This is something
changing completely here.

00:33:40.050 --> 00:33:43.430
And again, one single mutation.

00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:46.570
And in this case, not
even a mutation wiping out

00:33:46.570 --> 00:33:49.400
the function entirely
of some protein

00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:52.800
as in PKU or Testicular
Feminization Syndrome.

00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:54.590
But now you've got
a protein that's

00:33:54.590 --> 00:33:58.480
just working differently,
slowly enough that you

00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:02.260
get this very different picture
popping out the other end.

00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:06.300
What's most interesting is you
have this intersection between

00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:09.980
molecular biology
and the bio-, endo-

00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:12.150
consequences of this
mutation, all of that.

00:34:12.150 --> 00:34:14.230
And the cultural context
of it, apparently

00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:16.600
in both of these
populations, people

00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:18.260
have kind of adapted to it.

00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:19.690
It's not a big deal.

00:34:19.690 --> 00:34:22.350
You know, puberty--
sometimes you get acne.

00:34:22.350 --> 00:34:24.009
Sometimes you get a penis.

00:34:24.009 --> 00:34:26.090
And people just deal with that.

00:34:26.090 --> 00:34:28.199
That's just part of
the whole process

00:34:28.199 --> 00:34:32.199
and cultural accommodation
to interesting biology.

00:34:32.199 --> 00:34:34.179
One final example
of where you can

00:34:34.179 --> 00:34:36.199
have a classical
type of mutation,

00:34:36.199 --> 00:34:39.280
and another version of
a very mild difference.

00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:42.060
And in this case, it is
not a very mild difference

00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:44.239
producing an overt disease.

00:34:44.239 --> 00:34:46.550
In this case, it's just
producing something

00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:49.699
that probably differs in you
from the person sitting next

00:34:49.699 --> 00:34:50.650
to you.

00:34:50.650 --> 00:34:54.110
Which is, you have a
neurochemical system,

00:34:54.110 --> 00:34:57.139
a system of chemical
messengers in your brain.

00:34:57.139 --> 00:34:58.634
If this is new stuff, hang on.

00:34:58.634 --> 00:35:00.550
It will all be explained
in a couple of weeks.

00:35:00.550 --> 00:35:03.700
But this is a class of
neurochemical signaling

00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:06.520
that has something
to do with anxiety.

00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:10.360
A chemical messenger
which decreases anxiety.

00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:12.980
And we will learn plenty
about that down the line.

00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:15.200
And there's this regular class.

00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:18.550
They're known collectively
as benzodiazepines.

00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:21.250
Do not panic if you've not
heard that word before,

00:35:21.250 --> 00:35:23.310
and certainly do not
attempt to spell it right,

00:35:23.310 --> 00:35:24.860
because it's not possible to.

00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:26.470
So benzodiazepines.

00:35:26.470 --> 00:35:29.401
There are synthetic
versions of benzodiazepines

00:35:29.401 --> 00:35:30.900
which people might
take when they're

00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:34.610
feeling anxious like
Vallium, like Librium.

00:35:34.610 --> 00:35:38.570
Vallium is the synthetic
benzodiazepine.

00:35:38.570 --> 00:35:41.950
So benzodiazepines
are protein, and they

00:35:41.950 --> 00:35:43.080
have a particular shape.

00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:46.850
And you guessed, it there are
thus benzodiazepine receptors,

00:35:46.850 --> 00:35:50.590
which could do that whole lock
and key deal going on there.

00:35:50.590 --> 00:35:53.450
And what you have
are differences,

00:35:53.450 --> 00:35:56.600
small, single point,
in this case not

00:35:56.600 --> 00:35:59.860
mutations, but simply
different versions

00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:03.770
that one letter can come in
in the DNA sequence specifying

00:36:03.770 --> 00:36:06.210
the benzodiazepine receptor.

00:36:06.210 --> 00:36:07.520
These are not mutations.

00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:12.350
This is just normal variability
is one particular spot

00:36:12.350 --> 00:36:15.300
can specify two or three
different amino acids

00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:17.330
that function roughly the same.

00:36:17.330 --> 00:36:20.800
So that you're changing somewhat
the shape of the receptor,

00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:24.740
and thus changing somewhat how
long the benzodiazepine stays

00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:27.060
in there, and how long
the signal is sent.

00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:28.360
And it's all very subtle.

00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:30.420
And what does this
begin to explain?

00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:33.930
Individual differences
in levels of anxiety.

00:36:33.930 --> 00:36:37.470
It's only one of the gazillion
ways of explaining it,

00:36:37.470 --> 00:36:39.760
but it's part of
that picture there.

00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:42.100
Here we have
individual differences.

00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:45.060
This explained a very
interesting finding.

00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:49.240
For decades, people often tried
to breed rats, different rat

00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:51.440
lines for different
behavioral traits.

00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:54.140
And it makes it
very useful models.

00:36:54.140 --> 00:36:57.030
There are alcoholism prone rats.

00:36:57.030 --> 00:36:59.730
There are rats that have
been bred for being smart,

00:36:59.730 --> 00:37:02.880
for being not as smart at
spatial maze stuff, et cetera.

00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:05.630
And for years, there'd
been a number of rat lines

00:37:05.630 --> 00:37:08.470
that have been bred that
were either high anxiety

00:37:08.470 --> 00:37:10.500
or low anxiety rats.

00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:16.710
Very useful for understanding
things like-- what are they're

00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:17.470
useful for?

00:37:17.470 --> 00:37:18.012
I don't know.

00:37:18.012 --> 00:37:19.386
They're just cool
to have around.

00:37:19.386 --> 00:37:21.550
Very useful for understand
the effects of stress,

00:37:21.550 --> 00:37:22.665
or things of that sort.

00:37:22.665 --> 00:37:26.600
So finally, modern era of
molecular biology comes in,

00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:29.270
and those high and
low anxiety strains

00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:32.670
differ in the shape of the
benzodiazepine receptor in many

00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:33.740
of these cases.

00:37:33.740 --> 00:37:36.190
Again, tiny little differences.

00:37:36.190 --> 00:37:39.470
So what we've got here
is classic old genetics

00:37:39.470 --> 00:37:41.000
at the molecular level.

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:45.030
These tiny little changes in
one single base pair at a time--

00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:47.330
point, deletion, insertion.

00:37:47.330 --> 00:37:49.950
A world in which it may or
may not change the shape.

00:37:49.950 --> 00:37:52.240
Where it could change it
dramatically and produce

00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:54.400
some pretty exciting,
dramatic diseases

00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:56.360
where you wind up with
a different gender

00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:57.590
than your chromosomes say.

00:37:57.590 --> 00:37:59.660
Ones where you get more
subtle differences.

00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:02.940
You change gender at
your 13th birthday.

00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:06.090
Or ones where we're
just for the first time

00:38:06.090 --> 00:38:09.860
beginning to look at the
individual differences that

00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:11.900
flow out from stuff like this.

00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:15.590
Not them and their disease,
but the individual variability.

00:38:15.590 --> 00:38:18.940
All of this is in the
realm of single base

00:38:18.940 --> 00:38:21.090
pairs being changed.

00:38:21.090 --> 00:38:23.300
What all of this
now allows us to do

00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:27.580
is translate this world
of mutational changes

00:38:27.580 --> 00:38:30.620
into what does this look
like evolutionarily?

00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:33.320
What does this look like
in terms of explaining

00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:34.770
patterns of evolution?

00:38:34.770 --> 00:38:37.890
And you will know exactly
where this goes right now.

00:38:37.890 --> 00:38:42.010
This helps explain
the classical,

00:38:42.010 --> 00:38:46.480
the gradualist picture of
little bits of change at a time.

00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:49.830
Little bits because you've got
one protein which now works

00:38:49.830 --> 00:38:51.890
a little bit
differently, and thus you

00:38:51.890 --> 00:38:54.700
get to ask a
sociobiology question.

00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:58.640
By having testosterone having
a little bit more of an effect

00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:00.400
or a little bit
less of an effect

00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:02.680
by way of molecular
changes in this receptor,

00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:05.320
is that going to increase
the number of copies of genes

00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:06.560
that individual has?

00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:08.750
Is it going to
decrease the number?

00:39:08.750 --> 00:39:12.030
How's it going to fit into
all of last week's science?

00:39:12.030 --> 00:39:15.010
And you will know exactly
how that drill will run.

00:39:15.010 --> 00:39:18.580
Oh, if thanks to one
single base pair changing,

00:39:18.580 --> 00:39:22.080
you now have a receptor
which functions in a slightly

00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:26.050
different way, which makes
this individual 1.5% more

00:39:26.050 --> 00:39:29.220
fertile than everybody else
that they're competing against,

00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:31.460
you just wait long
enough and come back,

00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:33.720
and everybody in
that population is

00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:36.290
going to have that
different version of it.

00:39:36.290 --> 00:39:38.330
We can run the logic there.

00:39:38.330 --> 00:39:42.210
We have variability--
Darwinian variability-- thanks

00:39:42.210 --> 00:39:43.580
to a mutation.

00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:45.700
We have differential fitness.

00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:49.320
We have just defined an adaptive
difference somehow or other.

00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:52.150
There there's a
smidgen of advantage,

00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:54.140
thanks to a slightly
different shape.

00:39:54.140 --> 00:39:57.900
And thus we have selection
changing distribution

00:39:57.900 --> 00:39:58.810
over time.

00:39:58.810 --> 00:40:01.130
The smidgen more
effective version

00:40:01.130 --> 00:40:03.820
will become more common
in the population.

00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:05.700
And what's also
intrinsic in that

00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:09.220
is that these are slow
little steps of change.

00:40:09.220 --> 00:40:10.900
This is gradualism.

00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:14.940
So gradualism is absolutely
commensurate with everything

00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:19.970
we got last week built around
adaptation, competition.

00:40:19.970 --> 00:40:21.640
Every little bit
makes a difference

00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:24.730
because 1% difference in
number of copies your genes.

00:40:24.730 --> 00:40:26.460
Run it enough
generations, and that's

00:40:26.460 --> 00:40:28.490
going to be a big
difference, and all of it

00:40:28.490 --> 00:40:32.700
changing in a very
gradualist, incremental way.

00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:34.950
This has popped up in
a number of domains

00:40:34.950 --> 00:40:37.570
and could be really useful,
because it allows you

00:40:37.570 --> 00:40:41.070
for one thing to trace
evolutionary history by looking

00:40:41.070 --> 00:40:43.580
at the changes of
single base pairs.

00:40:43.580 --> 00:40:46.940
And that's allowed for looking
at one really interesting gene,

00:40:46.940 --> 00:40:52.020
which we may talk about down
the line, a gene called Fox P2.

00:40:52.020 --> 00:40:56.890
Fox P2 has something
to do with language.

00:40:56.890 --> 00:41:01.790
Fox P2 was first identified
and a family, all of whom

00:41:01.790 --> 00:41:05.210
had some sort of language
communication problem.

00:41:05.210 --> 00:41:07.860
And people to this day
argue whether it was mostly

00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:11.380
about coordinating the
motoric aspects of speech

00:41:11.380 --> 00:41:15.010
or was it something about
grasping the symbolic message

00:41:15.010 --> 00:41:16.850
aspects of language,
all of that.

00:41:16.850 --> 00:41:19.680
In any case, a mutation
was found in this gene,

00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:21.890
and a whole cottage
industry has emerged

00:41:21.890 --> 00:41:24.990
since then of studying Fox P2.

00:41:24.990 --> 00:41:28.530
Because versions
of Fox P2 occur all

00:41:28.530 --> 00:41:32.460
throughout the animal
kingdom-- in birds, and rats,

00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:35.340
and non-human primates,
and all sorts of things.

00:41:35.340 --> 00:41:38.534
Fox P2 popping up
all over the place.

00:41:38.534 --> 00:41:39.950
And in all these
different places,

00:41:39.950 --> 00:41:42.770
it's got something to
do with communication.

00:41:42.770 --> 00:41:45.020
It's got something
to do with bird song.

00:41:45.020 --> 00:41:49.070
It's got something to do with
rat ultrasonic vocalizations.

00:41:49.070 --> 00:41:51.910
Rats are constantly jabbering
at each other in a range

00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:52.990
that we can't hear.

00:41:52.990 --> 00:41:56.180
And Fox P2 has something
to do within all of those.

00:41:56.180 --> 00:42:01.190
And different versions of Fox P2
in all these different species.

00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:03.440
And what becomes
most pertinent is

00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:05.530
when you look at
those differences,

00:42:05.530 --> 00:42:08.130
you will see tiny
little differences

00:42:08.130 --> 00:42:10.950
in this tree across all
these different species.

00:42:10.950 --> 00:42:15.250
One base pair difference
between rats and mice.

00:42:15.250 --> 00:42:19.570
One base pair difference
between hawks and elephants.

00:42:19.570 --> 00:42:20.970
That sort of thing varies.

00:42:20.970 --> 00:42:26.030
And then you look out at humans,
and a whole bunch of changes.

00:42:26.030 --> 00:42:30.010
A whole bunch of changes in a
very short evolutionary period.

00:42:30.010 --> 00:42:32.780
What this suggests
is no wonder this

00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:35.880
is producing some very
different stuff than these guys.

00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:37.850
A very different gene.

00:42:37.850 --> 00:42:39.460
And a very different
gene, people

00:42:39.460 --> 00:42:41.910
now have been able
to back calculate

00:42:41.910 --> 00:42:46.410
due to a series of single
base pair changes somewhere

00:42:46.410 --> 00:42:49.490
in the last quarter
million years or so.

00:42:49.490 --> 00:42:51.050
And that makes a difference.

00:42:51.050 --> 00:42:53.640
Totally cool,
unsettling experiment

00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:55.290
that was done a few
years ago, which

00:42:55.290 --> 00:42:59.410
was some people taking the
human version of Fox P2

00:42:59.410 --> 00:43:03.320
and knocking out a mouse line,
knocking out their own Fox P2

00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:07.380
and sticky in the human version
and seeing what happens.

00:43:07.380 --> 00:43:09.370
And it was very interesting.

00:43:09.370 --> 00:43:12.640
They immediately sing the theme
song from all the Mickey Mouse

00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:13.563
cartoons.

00:43:13.563 --> 00:43:15.040
Ha, can they prove that?

00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:19.210
OK, what you see is you've
got more complex types

00:43:19.210 --> 00:43:22.860
of ultrasonic vocalization
in these mice.

00:43:22.860 --> 00:43:24.890
That's really interesting.

00:43:24.890 --> 00:43:27.210
And there's years
of stuff to sort out

00:43:27.210 --> 00:43:28.530
what's going on with that.

00:43:28.530 --> 00:43:30.960
For our purposes, the
main thing is here

00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:34.500
you have wound up with a very
different world than chirping,

00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:37.300
and buzzing, and
barking, and all of that.

00:43:37.300 --> 00:43:39.790
And you wind up with a
very different version

00:43:39.790 --> 00:43:43.950
of this gene where you can
trace out how many amino acid

00:43:43.950 --> 00:43:45.170
changes it took.

00:43:45.170 --> 00:43:47.390
And every step of
the way, you were

00:43:47.390 --> 00:43:50.610
having some gradualist process.

00:43:50.610 --> 00:43:53.400
What also this
allows you to do is

00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:58.800
look at a footprint, an echo
of what the selection was like.

00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:00.470
Important concept here.

00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:02.190
So back to that business.

00:44:02.190 --> 00:44:05.570
There's 64 different ways
of coding for amino acids,

00:44:05.570 --> 00:44:08.840
a couple of them are just
informational, stop messages,

00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:09.360
and stuff.

00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:13.480
There's about 60 different ways
of coding for 20 amino acids.

00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:15.760
So on the average,
each amino acid

00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:19.450
could be coded for in
three different ways.

00:44:19.450 --> 00:44:24.810
So suppose you throw
in a random mutation.

00:44:24.810 --> 00:44:30.540
And of those, what you find is
of the 60 possible mutations,

00:44:30.540 --> 00:44:34.850
40 of them will not cause
a change in the amino acid.

00:44:34.850 --> 00:44:39.600
Statistically, 2/3 of the time,
there will not be a change.

00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:41.510
So in other words,
if you scatter

00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:44.880
a whole bunch of
mutations, and you wind up

00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:49.810
seeing 2/3 are neutral in
terms of their consequence,

00:44:49.810 --> 00:44:53.890
and 1/3 third actually causes a
change in an amino acid, that's

00:44:53.890 --> 00:44:57.180
telling you it's happening
at the random expected rate

00:44:57.180 --> 00:45:01.620
of mutations popping up that are
either consequential-- changing

00:45:01.620 --> 00:45:04.590
an amino acid-- or
inconsequential-- just coding

00:45:04.590 --> 00:45:08.390
for a different version
of the same amino acid.

00:45:08.390 --> 00:45:11.940
Now suppose you find
a gene that differs.

00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:14.170
And you look at the ways
in which it differs.

00:45:14.170 --> 00:45:17.220
And 99% of the base
pair differences

00:45:17.220 --> 00:45:19.700
over the course
of this 5 million

00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:23.420
base pair-along gene,
99% of the differences

00:45:23.420 --> 00:45:27.450
make for a different amino
acid than beforehand.

00:45:27.450 --> 00:45:30.540
In other words, at much
higher than expected rate

00:45:30.540 --> 00:45:32.520
if this was a random process.

00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:34.316
What is this an echo of?

00:45:34.316 --> 00:45:37.400
Of very strong selection.

00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:42.630
Of very strongly advantageous
traits driven by these changes.

00:45:42.630 --> 00:45:44.980
Term used-- this would
be a mark of their

00:45:44.980 --> 00:45:49.160
having been positive
selection for this trait.

00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:51.850
In other words, the changes
that it has gone through

00:45:51.850 --> 00:45:54.510
over the gazillion
years has not been just

00:45:54.510 --> 00:45:57.970
by random mutational
rates of neutral.

00:45:57.970 --> 00:46:01.130
And remember, every amino
acid is coded for three ways.

00:46:01.130 --> 00:46:04.080
If 99% of them
are consequential,

00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:09.100
there has been some major, hard
ass selection going on there.

00:46:09.100 --> 00:46:11.580
Alternatively, if
you find a long gene

00:46:11.580 --> 00:46:15.950
with a whole bunch of mutations
and 99% of them are neutral,

00:46:15.950 --> 00:46:18.540
make no change at all,
what does that tell you?

00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:20.990
This protein's function
you do not want

00:46:20.990 --> 00:46:22.700
to mess with in the slightest.

00:46:22.700 --> 00:46:25.710
Even a minor change in the
function of it, and you

00:46:25.710 --> 00:46:27.880
don't pass on copies
of your genes.

00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:32.330
This would be stabilizing
selection, negative selection,

00:46:32.330 --> 00:46:37.640
strong selection to make sure
that this gene and its function

00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:40.610
downline as the protein
does not change.

00:46:40.610 --> 00:46:45.390
When you look at the number of
changes, the burst of mutations

00:46:45.390 --> 00:46:48.280
over the last quarter million
years or so that differentiated

00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:51.460
Fox P2 in humans from
these other species,

00:46:51.460 --> 00:46:55.500
it's almost entirely evidences
of positive selection.

00:46:55.500 --> 00:46:58.650
This did not just
happen by chance.

00:46:58.650 --> 00:47:02.030
Every step of coming up
with these new versions,

00:47:02.030 --> 00:47:04.600
these new amino acids
in the sequence there,

00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:08.250
clearly were ones that were
positively selected for.

00:47:08.250 --> 00:47:12.000
A lot of selection brought
about this huge difference.

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:12.500
OK.

00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:16.360
So that begins to give
the sense here of how

00:47:16.360 --> 00:47:18.470
these little changes can occur.

00:47:18.470 --> 00:47:20.160
At this point, we
have to go through one

00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:23.750
of the all time confusing
things in genetics out there,

00:47:23.750 --> 00:47:26.980
which is something two
factoids and two soundbites

00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:30.920
that seemingly totally
contradict with each other.

00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:34.460
You share, on the
average, 50% of your DNA

00:47:34.460 --> 00:47:37.430
with a full sibling.

00:47:37.430 --> 00:47:42.890
You share 98% of your
DNA with chimpanzees.

00:47:42.890 --> 00:47:44.560
What's up with that?

00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:46.920
That seems a little
bit unexpected.

00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:49.700
And those are two soundbites
that everybody knows.

00:47:49.700 --> 00:47:52.010
Everybody knows it goes
through like basic Mendel.

00:47:52.010 --> 00:47:57.180
50%, 100% with an identical
twin, 50% with a full sibling.

00:47:57.180 --> 00:47:59.050
You know that song
and dance by now.

00:47:59.050 --> 00:48:02.100
And meanwhile, one of
the great soundbites

00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:05.980
of our evolutionary history, and
the mark of evolution, and what

00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:07.860
in hell are you
creationists thinking,

00:48:07.860 --> 00:48:11.160
is the fact that, oh, humans
share 98% of their DNA

00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:12.270
with chimps.

00:48:12.270 --> 00:48:13.950
This doesn't make any sense.

00:48:13.950 --> 00:48:17.110
One minute here to be spent on
just clarifying that one that

00:48:17.110 --> 00:48:19.450
is not contradictory at all.

00:48:19.450 --> 00:48:22.695
Genes specify by
way of proteins--

00:48:22.695 --> 00:48:24.320
and now this is taking
a bunch of leaps

00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:28.390
down there-- traits, aspects.

00:48:28.390 --> 00:48:31.510
Gene specify, to be
totally simplifying here,

00:48:31.510 --> 00:48:35.810
genes specify for
antlers, for dorsal fins,

00:48:35.810 --> 00:48:40.210
for petals, and pistils
and stamens, for kidneys,

00:48:40.210 --> 00:48:42.760
for-- it's totally simplifying.

00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:46.610
So right off the bat, you will
have some genetic similarities

00:48:46.610 --> 00:48:49.200
between two different
species in that both of them

00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:52.600
will have genes that
code for dorsal fins.

00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:55.280
You're thinking about two
different species of whales.

00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:59.550
So they share genes
coding for dorsal fins.

00:48:59.550 --> 00:49:00.910
Whales have dorsal fins.

00:49:00.910 --> 00:49:04.960
Neither we nor chimpanzees
have genes for dorsal fins.

00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:08.950
Meanwhile, we have genes
coding for a pelvis that

00:49:08.950 --> 00:49:11.410
has a certain shape
which either in chimps

00:49:11.410 --> 00:49:14.120
predisposes towards being
able to walk bipedal

00:49:14.120 --> 00:49:16.160
for certain strengths
of the length of time.

00:49:16.160 --> 00:49:16.980
Us as well.

00:49:16.980 --> 00:49:20.670
You don't find these
genes in apple trees.

00:49:20.670 --> 00:49:23.100
They don't have pelvises
that are shaped like those,

00:49:23.100 --> 00:49:24.260
so they don't have.

00:49:24.260 --> 00:49:27.150
So when you look at the
human and the chimp genome,

00:49:27.150 --> 00:49:32.580
98% of the genes code for
similar kind of things.

00:49:32.580 --> 00:49:35.240
We share with chimps
an absence of genes

00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:41.365
for antlers, and trunks,
and tusks, and wings,

00:49:41.365 --> 00:49:43.000
or serve who knows what.

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:44.950
And we share all
sorts of other genes

00:49:44.950 --> 00:49:47.900
in common having to do with
our shared immune systems,

00:49:47.900 --> 00:49:48.910
et cetera, et cetera.

00:49:48.910 --> 00:49:53.930
So 98% of the genes code
for similar types of things.

00:49:53.930 --> 00:49:56.700
So that's where we get the
98% similarity with the chimps

00:49:56.700 --> 00:49:57.330
from.

00:49:57.330 --> 00:49:59.410
For each one of
those genes, it could

00:49:59.410 --> 00:50:01.610
come in a couple of
different flavors,

00:50:01.610 --> 00:50:03.520
a bunch of different flavors.

00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:08.480
And thus asking not to do
both you and your full sibling

00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:12.450
have a gene for
opposable thumbs, do you

00:50:12.450 --> 00:50:14.560
and your sibling
have the same type

00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:16.570
of gene for opposable thumbs?

00:50:16.570 --> 00:50:18.840
So suddenly that's
a different world

00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:22.080
of variants on
each type of gene.

00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:25.680
So when talking about the
amount of DNA shared in common,

00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:28.480
the genes shared in common
with other species, what you're

00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:31.190
talking about are
the types of genes

00:50:31.190 --> 00:50:33.420
coding for the types of traits.

00:50:33.420 --> 00:50:36.190
When we're talking about,
from last week's notion,

00:50:36.190 --> 00:50:40.340
50%, 25%, 12.5%, one
brother and eight cousins,

00:50:40.340 --> 00:50:42.890
what you're talking about
are different versions

00:50:42.890 --> 00:50:44.540
of particular genes.

00:50:44.540 --> 00:50:46.430
Important clarification.

00:50:46.430 --> 00:50:49.890
So final thing here before the
break, which is once again,

00:50:49.890 --> 00:50:53.180
notice with these models,
these point mutations,

00:50:53.180 --> 00:50:55.840
where you can get slight
differences in function.

00:50:55.840 --> 00:50:58.910
And thanks to a 1% difference
in fitness and number

00:50:58.910 --> 00:51:02.510
of copies of genes, you get
these gradualist changes.

00:51:02.510 --> 00:51:04.630
What's intrinsic
in that, and where

00:51:04.630 --> 00:51:07.680
we get the political
theme coming through is,

00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:10.550
thus there's
competition everywhere.

00:51:10.550 --> 00:51:12.740
In terms of the
evolution of behavior,

00:51:12.740 --> 00:51:17.830
the evolution of species, every
little bit of genetic advantage

00:51:17.830 --> 00:51:20.580
will play out in
some competitive way

00:51:20.580 --> 00:51:23.020
in some little
bit of an increase

00:51:23.020 --> 00:51:24.288
in reproductive success.

00:51:27.780 --> 00:51:28.660
OK.

00:51:28.660 --> 00:51:32.854
Whoa, there's a lot of
Apples there lit up.

00:51:35.580 --> 00:51:37.350
Well, that wasn't very subtle.

00:51:37.350 --> 00:51:38.690
Let's take a break.

00:51:38.690 --> 00:51:40.425
Whoever did that.

00:51:40.425 --> 00:51:42.890
OK, a five minute break.

00:51:42.890 --> 00:51:45.700
Are you slightly
more fit by the rules

00:51:45.700 --> 00:51:49.640
of your population's natural
selection, sexual selection,

00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:50.410
whatever?

00:51:50.410 --> 00:51:52.580
Even if that gives
you a tiny advantage

00:51:52.580 --> 00:51:55.410
thanks to this tiny
change in this tiny gene,

00:51:55.410 --> 00:51:58.280
enough generations
go by, and that trait

00:51:58.280 --> 00:52:00.150
is going to become
more prevalent.

00:52:00.150 --> 00:52:04.720
Final point there intrinsic in
this, is if every little bit

00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:07.970
of difference matters in
terms of fitness and gene

00:52:07.970 --> 00:52:10.950
distribution within
the realm of behavior,

00:52:10.950 --> 00:52:14.180
every little bit of
competition matters.

00:52:14.180 --> 00:52:19.300
A very, very intertwined
political, philosophical stance

00:52:19.300 --> 00:52:23.500
in gradualism as it
applies to evolution.

00:52:23.500 --> 00:52:26.230
So that's been sitting
there around forever.

00:52:26.230 --> 00:52:30.810
And in the 1980s, suddenly a
very different model emerged.

00:52:30.810 --> 00:52:33.390
And this came from
Stephen Jay Gould, who

00:52:33.390 --> 00:52:35.280
we heard about the other day.

00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:37.930
Stephen Jay Gould,
and the person,

00:52:37.930 --> 00:52:40.550
the poor schnook who
was always lost in this,

00:52:40.550 --> 00:52:43.800
another evolutionary biologist
named Niles Eldridge who

00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:46.280
somehow did not quite have
the press that Stephen Jay

00:52:46.280 --> 00:52:49.309
Gould did, so he is lost to
history except for people

00:52:49.309 --> 00:52:50.350
who know what he's up to.

00:52:50.350 --> 00:52:51.940
And he's an amazing scientist.

00:52:51.940 --> 00:52:56.330
But Gould and Eldridge came up
with a very different model.

00:52:56.330 --> 00:53:01.520
And I alluded to it the other
day and drew it right there.

00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:05.930
And their notion was that
gradualism is nonsense.

00:53:05.930 --> 00:53:09.510
There are not gradualistic
incremental changes.

00:53:09.510 --> 00:53:14.180
Evolution is not being driven
by small gradualist changes.

00:53:14.180 --> 00:53:16.850
Instead, what their
model was is that there's

00:53:16.850 --> 00:53:22.410
long periods of nothing
happening, of stasis.

00:53:22.410 --> 00:53:24.340
Long periods of
nothing happening.

00:53:24.340 --> 00:53:28.320
If there's changes in DNA
sequences thanks to mutations,

00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:30.060
they're not consequential.

00:53:30.060 --> 00:53:32.030
Or if they're
consequential enough

00:53:32.030 --> 00:53:34.920
to change the fitness
of one organism 1%,

00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:36.730
that's not going to
make a difference.

00:53:36.730 --> 00:53:39.740
Most of the time, no
change is occurring.

00:53:39.740 --> 00:53:43.470
And when it does occur,
it is in incredibly fast,

00:53:43.470 --> 00:53:47.360
explosive periods
of change followed

00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:49.400
by a new period of stasis.

00:53:49.400 --> 00:53:53.380
Evolutionary change comes in
step functions rather than

00:53:53.380 --> 00:53:54.900
smooth gradualism.

00:53:54.900 --> 00:53:59.240
Long periods of stasis
followed by dramatic jumps

00:53:59.240 --> 00:54:02.910
of evolutionary change
in short periods of time.

00:54:02.910 --> 00:54:04.910
Thus, they called
this the notion

00:54:04.910 --> 00:54:07.020
of punctuated equilibrium.

00:54:07.020 --> 00:54:10.090
Long periods of
equilibrium and stasis

00:54:10.090 --> 00:54:14.030
punctuated by periods
of very rapid change.

00:54:14.030 --> 00:54:19.120
And as I mentioned the other
day, Gould was a Marxist

00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:21.160
and felt that Marxist's
sort of stance

00:54:21.160 --> 00:54:24.150
was running through all of the
ways to think about genetics.

00:54:24.150 --> 00:54:26.316
And I don't now what's
up with Niles Eldredge,

00:54:26.316 --> 00:54:27.690
but that was the
case with Gould.

00:54:27.690 --> 00:54:29.420
And when you look
at this model, this

00:54:29.420 --> 00:54:33.480
is like classically
fitting with stasis,

00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:37.160
and revolutionary change,
and dialectical materialism,

00:54:37.160 --> 00:54:38.170
and stuff like that.

00:54:38.170 --> 00:54:40.720
The last sentence, I have
no idea what I just said.

00:54:40.720 --> 00:54:42.390
But apparently
that's got something

00:54:42.390 --> 00:54:43.810
to do with that stuff.

00:54:43.810 --> 00:54:46.950
And once again, we see
in a very different way,

00:54:46.950 --> 00:54:50.100
a political theme running
through a different worlds

00:54:50.100 --> 00:54:54.290
view of what evolution is
about-- punctuated equilibrium.

00:54:54.290 --> 00:54:56.960
OK, so where did the idea
of punctuated equilibrium

00:54:56.960 --> 00:54:58.450
come to these guys?

00:54:58.450 --> 00:55:02.420
Mainly because Gould
was not a biologist.

00:55:02.420 --> 00:55:05.330
He was certainly not an
evolutionary biologist.

00:55:05.330 --> 00:55:07.670
What he was a paleontologist.

00:55:07.670 --> 00:55:11.130
He studied fossils.

00:55:11.130 --> 00:55:13.810
He studied the history,
the evolutionary history

00:55:13.810 --> 00:55:14.720
of fossils.

00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:16.560
And apparently, like
totally separate

00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:19.240
of his large
theoretical models, he

00:55:19.240 --> 00:55:21.410
was like the world's
expert on the evolution

00:55:21.410 --> 00:55:25.800
of some Caribbean snail shell
over the last 10 billion years

00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:26.550
or something.

00:55:26.550 --> 00:55:28.940
He's one of those
paleontologists who

00:55:28.940 --> 00:55:34.140
traces lineages of evolutionary
change over the course of time

00:55:34.140 --> 00:55:38.050
with fossils, fossil
records, as the readout.

00:55:38.050 --> 00:55:42.070
So he's a paleontologist
slash geologist in some ways.

00:55:42.070 --> 00:55:45.020
And when you do that, you notice
something, which is you've

00:55:45.020 --> 00:55:46.730
got gaps in the record.

00:55:46.730 --> 00:55:49.230
You've got your
famed missing links.

00:55:49.230 --> 00:55:51.980
You have gaps in your
evolutionary record

00:55:51.980 --> 00:55:53.770
there of what fossils look like.

00:55:53.770 --> 00:55:57.550
And you're measuring some
trait or other in these snails,

00:55:57.550 --> 00:55:59.990
or trilobites, or whatever
you're looking at.

00:55:59.990 --> 00:56:02.600
And at this time period,
the trait looks like this.

00:56:02.600 --> 00:56:04.270
At this time period,
it looks like this.

00:56:04.270 --> 00:56:07.220
And this looks like a perfectly
good gradualist model.

00:56:07.220 --> 00:56:09.760
And what Gould would
notice is as the field got

00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:13.720
more and more information,
more and more intervening steps

00:56:13.720 --> 00:56:16.340
on a lot of these
fossil histories,

00:56:16.340 --> 00:56:21.100
they would start to
look more like this.

00:56:21.100 --> 00:56:23.750
And every now and then,
you would see something

00:56:23.750 --> 00:56:25.320
like this in between.

00:56:25.320 --> 00:56:28.810
And from that, that begin
to suggest to him this model

00:56:28.810 --> 00:56:31.310
of punctuated equilibrium.

00:56:31.310 --> 00:56:34.610
Most of the time, as assessed
by the fossil record,

00:56:34.610 --> 00:56:38.690
nothing dramatic is happening--
long periods of stasis.

00:56:38.690 --> 00:56:41.620
And what allowed this to occur
is that for some fossils,

00:56:41.620 --> 00:56:45.570
you have incredibly detailed
evolutionary history, where

00:56:45.570 --> 00:56:48.780
you can begin to fill in
lines, and they wind up

00:56:48.780 --> 00:56:51.240
looking punctuated in this way.

00:56:51.240 --> 00:56:53.700
So out of him comes
this whole theory

00:56:53.700 --> 00:56:56.750
that it's all about punctuated
equilibrium rather than

00:56:56.750 --> 00:56:58.020
gradualism.

00:56:58.020 --> 00:57:01.330
Right off the bat, what are
the consequences of that?

00:57:01.330 --> 00:57:04.980
Little genetic
changes don't matter.

00:57:04.980 --> 00:57:09.980
Competition driven by the notion
of little changes mattering

00:57:09.980 --> 00:57:11.550
aren't actually occurring.

00:57:11.550 --> 00:57:13.910
In model [? saying ?]
most of the time, all

00:57:13.910 --> 00:57:17.480
of the notions of if you figure
out the right kid to kidnap

00:57:17.480 --> 00:57:19.100
when the big guy
is coming at you,

00:57:19.100 --> 00:57:21.170
and you'll leave more
copies, and figuring out

00:57:21.170 --> 00:57:24.240
exactly who to be
infanticidal to, all that,

00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:25.720
it's not going to
make a difference

00:57:25.720 --> 00:57:27.470
in terms of gene distribution.

00:57:27.470 --> 00:57:30.450
Evolution is not
being driven by that.

00:57:30.450 --> 00:57:33.660
And out of it came this
very strong indictment

00:57:33.660 --> 00:57:36.380
of the sociobiological
view of what you've

00:57:36.380 --> 00:57:40.360
got there is a world where it's
all about competition, where

00:57:40.360 --> 00:57:44.470
it's all about hierarchy, where
it's all about domination,

00:57:44.470 --> 00:57:45.800
where it's all about that.

00:57:45.800 --> 00:57:47.810
Hey, isn't that interesting
that that's exactly

00:57:47.810 --> 00:57:49.434
the sort of world
that these folks live

00:57:49.434 --> 00:57:52.010
in who are benefiting from
this, who started this theory?

00:57:52.010 --> 00:57:54.080
Very different notion here.

00:57:54.080 --> 00:57:57.430
Competition, selective
advantages, all of that,

00:57:57.430 --> 00:58:00.750
most of the time,
nothing's happening.

00:58:00.750 --> 00:58:03.150
So not surprisingly, all
of the evolutionary types

00:58:03.150 --> 00:58:05.980
from last week did
not like this one bit.

00:58:05.980 --> 00:58:09.090
And this was an
attacked left and right

00:58:09.090 --> 00:58:11.700
in some extremely valid ways.

00:58:11.700 --> 00:58:16.360
First one, first form of attack
is a very simple problem there,

00:58:16.360 --> 00:58:22.250
which is that you have two
different disciplines happening

00:58:22.250 --> 00:58:23.430
here.

00:58:23.430 --> 00:58:25.560
You get a
paleontologist, and you

00:58:25.560 --> 00:58:28.810
get a evolutionary
biologist, and they're

00:58:28.810 --> 00:58:31.110
functioning in completely
different universes.

00:58:34.970 --> 00:58:36.800
OK, stomach problems.

00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:39.370
And they're functioning in
completely different universes

00:58:39.370 --> 00:58:39.870
there.

00:58:39.870 --> 00:58:43.030
What counts as fast
for a paleontologist--

00:58:43.030 --> 00:58:46.753
these are tens of millions
of years going on.

00:58:46.753 --> 00:58:50.560
Whoa, incredibly fast
evolutionary change

00:58:50.560 --> 00:58:51.710
going on there.

00:58:51.710 --> 00:58:54.640
That's like 100,000 years.

00:58:54.640 --> 00:58:56.590
That's like, are you kidding me?

00:58:56.590 --> 00:58:58.380
Said the biologists.

00:58:58.380 --> 00:59:00.910
The ones who study one
generation at a time.

00:59:00.910 --> 00:59:02.340
That is asinine.

00:59:02.340 --> 00:59:03.690
That is ridiculous.

00:59:03.690 --> 00:59:06.450
This is them
imposing models where

00:59:06.450 --> 00:59:10.070
this has absolutely nothing to
do with how evolution actually

00:59:10.070 --> 00:59:10.650
works.

00:59:10.650 --> 00:59:14.110
These geologists get
completely thrown off,

00:59:14.110 --> 00:59:17.760
and these paleontologists
led by Gould, simply

00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:20.820
orders of magnitude
different scale of time.

00:59:20.820 --> 00:59:23.560
Yeah, maybe in some rough
approximation of what

00:59:23.560 --> 00:59:24.310
they look at.

00:59:24.310 --> 00:59:26.880
But they're not
studying evolution,

00:59:26.880 --> 00:59:29.630
because they're not biologists.

00:59:29.630 --> 00:59:34.430
Next critique-- the next
one made lots of sense also.

00:59:34.430 --> 00:59:38.480
Which was, you're not just
an evolutionary biologist,

00:59:38.480 --> 00:59:42.580
but you're one who thinks about
the evolution of the brain,

00:59:42.580 --> 00:59:48.100
or the evolution
of skin melanism,

00:59:48.100 --> 00:59:51.269
or the evolution of eye
color, or the evolution of how

00:59:51.269 --> 00:59:53.310
many chambers in your
heart you're going to have,

00:59:53.310 --> 00:59:55.600
or the evolution of
any of these things

00:59:55.600 --> 00:59:59.040
that will leave no
record whatsoever

00:59:59.040 --> 01:00:01.510
in the paleontological record.

01:00:01.510 --> 01:00:03.610
Because all
paleontology is about

01:00:03.610 --> 01:00:07.190
is shapes of stuff-- fossils.

01:00:07.190 --> 01:00:10.110
Fossils do not tell
you what kind of brain

01:00:10.110 --> 01:00:12.510
was going on inside that fern.

01:00:12.510 --> 01:00:16.000
Fossils do not tell you
anything about internal organs.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.890
Fossils do not tell you
anything about behavior.

01:00:18.890 --> 01:00:21.800
So at this point, all of
the evolutionary folks

01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:25.570
of the school from last
week attack and say, Yeah,

01:00:25.570 --> 01:00:26.420
what do they expect?

01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:29.270
They're studying the most
boring possible things--

01:00:29.270 --> 01:00:31.520
the morphology of organisms.

01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:34.260
Ooh, just because
the fact that humans,

01:00:34.260 --> 01:00:37.110
over the last like million
years or so, have not

01:00:37.110 --> 01:00:40.330
evolved getting rid of
the large trunk and roots

01:00:40.330 --> 01:00:42.530
that they have
during springtime,

01:00:42.530 --> 01:00:43.820
and now they don't have them.

01:00:43.820 --> 01:00:45.890
Oh, that morphological
change didn't occur,

01:00:45.890 --> 01:00:47.750
so obviously
there's been stasis.

01:00:47.750 --> 01:00:48.970
Give me a break.

01:00:48.970 --> 01:00:51.420
What is interesting
about evolution

01:00:51.420 --> 01:00:53.860
and evolutionary
change, paleontologists

01:00:53.860 --> 01:00:56.110
can't pick up, because
all they can study

01:00:56.110 --> 01:00:59.220
are forms, morphology.

01:00:59.220 --> 01:01:01.780
So that was a big
attack on these folks.

01:01:01.780 --> 01:01:04.250
So you've got the
Gouldian folks,

01:01:04.250 --> 01:01:06.220
the punctuated
equilibrium people,

01:01:06.220 --> 01:01:08.260
saying when you look
at the fossil record,

01:01:08.260 --> 01:01:09.960
it's not gradualism.

01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:12.400
And we've got some
really complete ones.

01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:16.020
And to this day, the
majority of fossil pedigrees

01:01:16.020 --> 01:01:17.730
where there are
very, very complete

01:01:17.730 --> 01:01:21.010
records, show patterns of
punctuated equilibrium.

01:01:21.010 --> 01:01:24.230
And back come the rejoinders,
this is ridiculous,

01:01:24.230 --> 01:01:26.270
the time span they talk about.

01:01:26.270 --> 01:01:27.330
That makes no sense.

01:01:27.330 --> 01:01:32.290
In this period, humans evolved,
doubled their brain size

01:01:32.290 --> 01:01:35.360
in the length of time that
they call a very rapid

01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:36.590
evolutionary change.

01:01:36.590 --> 01:01:38.410
Their time span is
completely crazy,

01:01:38.410 --> 01:01:41.460
and they can't study the
evolution of anything

01:01:41.460 --> 01:01:44.190
that's interesting because
they study fossils.

01:01:44.190 --> 01:01:47.070
But in lots of ways,
the best rebuttal,

01:01:47.070 --> 01:01:49.220
the one that most
got at these folks

01:01:49.220 --> 01:01:51.100
advocating punctuated
equilibrium,

01:01:51.100 --> 01:01:55.950
would be the gradualists saying,
Show me a molecular mechanism.

01:01:55.950 --> 01:02:00.810
Show me some way in which you
can get rapid change and then

01:02:00.810 --> 01:02:02.010
long stasis.

01:02:02.010 --> 01:02:04.910
Turn that into modern
molecular biology.

01:02:04.910 --> 01:02:07.270
Which is, occurring
two minutes after

01:02:07.270 --> 01:02:10.520
the microevolutionary people
were trashing the folks

01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:13.320
from last week saying, You need
to look for the actual genes.

01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:15.240
It's not enough just
to make up stories.

01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:19.220
And once these folks had
assimilated what evolution

01:02:19.220 --> 01:02:22.060
looks like on the genetic
level, mutational level,

01:02:22.060 --> 01:02:25.610
micromutational changes,
they loved genetics.

01:02:25.610 --> 01:02:27.200
They loved the
molecular end of it,

01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:29.680
because they could now turn
around to the Gouldians

01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:34.750
and say, Show me the genes, and
show me the mutations that will

01:02:34.750 --> 01:02:36.340
account for stuff like this.

01:02:36.340 --> 01:02:37.980
Because you can't
account for it.

01:02:37.980 --> 01:02:40.930
Because we all know classical
genetics and mutation,

01:02:40.930 --> 01:02:42.120
you don't get that.

01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:44.050
You get gradualism.

01:02:44.050 --> 01:02:47.730
So this was a period of enormous
hostility between the two

01:02:47.730 --> 01:02:48.610
camps.

01:02:48.610 --> 01:02:53.790
And the gradualists called the
punctuated equilibrium people

01:02:53.790 --> 01:02:56.560
evolutionary jerks.

01:02:56.560 --> 01:02:58.890
Ha ha.

01:02:58.890 --> 01:03:01.030
And the punctuated
equilibrium people

01:03:01.030 --> 01:03:04.400
called the gradualists creeps.

01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:07.620
So ultimately, they all
got along wonderfully

01:03:07.620 --> 01:03:08.900
because they were so witty.

01:03:08.900 --> 01:03:12.600
But what you had was
enormously hostile camps.

01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:15.330
And really quite
hostile because all

01:03:15.330 --> 01:03:17.800
sorts of implications
spreading beyond

01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:20.600
like how fast the
shape of this seashell

01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:22.880
was going to be evolving.

01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:25.770
And when they first
came on in the '80s, all

01:03:25.770 --> 01:03:29.280
of this controversy, the
punctuated equilibrium people

01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:31.820
didn't have a word
to say with the show

01:03:31.820 --> 01:03:33.750
me the molecular mechanisms.

01:03:33.750 --> 01:03:38.530
Show me mechanisms for mutation
that will produce rapid change.

01:03:38.530 --> 01:03:41.230
And everything that
has occurred since then

01:03:41.230 --> 01:03:42.980
in the world of
molecular genetics

01:03:42.980 --> 01:03:46.690
that has been most striking has
supported punctuated models--

01:03:46.690 --> 01:03:49.350
ways in which the
micromutational,

01:03:49.350 --> 01:03:52.220
microevolutionary
stuff of an hour ago

01:03:52.220 --> 01:03:56.480
is not what's going on
an awful lot of the time.

01:03:56.480 --> 01:03:59.960
Starters-- so simple
classical model.

01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:03.730
What we've got here
is a stretch of DNA.

01:04:03.730 --> 01:04:07.370
And this box
symbolizes a sequence

01:04:07.370 --> 01:04:10.120
of DNA coding for one gene.

01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:13.090
And right next to
it, once it finishes,

01:04:13.090 --> 01:04:17.064
one of those stop codon,
stop triplet signals,

01:04:17.064 --> 01:04:18.480
right after that
comes the stretch

01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:20.910
of DNA coding for the next
gene, and the next gene.

01:04:20.910 --> 01:04:22.550
And this is what DNA is about.

01:04:22.550 --> 01:04:25.660
It's the sequence genes there.

01:04:25.660 --> 01:04:27.530
And what you would
obviously then get

01:04:27.530 --> 01:04:31.110
is this arrow having this
intervening step of that RNA

01:04:31.110 --> 01:04:34.380
stuff, but eventually producing
an amino acid that produces

01:04:34.380 --> 01:04:35.530
a protein of this shape.

01:04:35.530 --> 01:04:38.880
And this is the protein
coded for by this gene.

01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:41.810
This, this, and so on, and
that's exactly how it works.

01:04:41.810 --> 01:04:44.790
That's the structure of DNA.

01:04:44.790 --> 01:04:48.260
Then, though, people began
to find that that's not

01:04:48.260 --> 01:04:49.960
the structure of DNA.

01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:51.700
And what you began
to get instead

01:04:51.700 --> 01:04:54.830
was something vastly
more interesting.

01:04:54.830 --> 01:04:57.160
Which is that,
for starters, when

01:04:57.160 --> 01:04:59.910
you look at coding
for one single gene,

01:04:59.910 --> 01:05:04.400
it's not necessarily coded
for in one continuous stretch

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:06.260
of DNA.

01:05:06.260 --> 01:05:09.610
In other words, it's
broken into little pieces.

01:05:09.610 --> 01:05:11.830
And you will have
a stretch of DNA

01:05:11.830 --> 01:05:14.600
coding for the first
third of the protein,

01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:18.310
and then a bunch of DNA that's
got nothing to do with it.

01:05:18.310 --> 01:05:19.250
Stay tuned.

01:05:19.250 --> 01:05:22.160
Then coding for the next third,
coding for the next third,

01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:27.740
that the gene was broken up
into separate coding domains.

01:05:27.740 --> 01:05:30.510
And the term that was
given for these was these

01:05:30.510 --> 01:05:32.830
were called exons.

01:05:32.830 --> 01:05:36.610
And the in-between boring
stuff were called introns.

01:05:36.610 --> 01:05:41.520
And this was a major finding
which made no sense whatsoever.

01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:44.340
Because how are you going to
get from this to then having

01:05:44.340 --> 01:05:47.850
a protein which has its
normal sequence and shape

01:05:47.850 --> 01:05:51.390
where this part was coded
for by this exon, Exon

01:05:51.390 --> 01:05:55.440
One of this gene, and this from
Exon Two, this from Exon Three.

01:05:55.440 --> 01:05:58.352
That's a completely
different world of stuff.

01:05:58.352 --> 01:05:59.560
How are you going to do that?

01:05:59.560 --> 01:06:02.330
Because you're
going to meet an RNA

01:06:02.330 --> 01:06:04.262
that's going to
encompass all of this,

01:06:04.262 --> 01:06:06.720
and that's going to code for
something completely different

01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:09.690
because you've got these
introns in between there.

01:06:09.690 --> 01:06:11.650
And people then
guessed something

01:06:11.650 --> 01:06:15.390
had to exist which was
soon discovered-- enzymes

01:06:15.390 --> 01:06:18.400
called splicing enzymes.

01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:20.440
And what they did
was exactly what

01:06:20.440 --> 01:06:22.050
you need to do to solve this.

01:06:22.050 --> 01:06:25.270
Which is at the RNA level,
the splicing enzymes

01:06:25.270 --> 01:06:28.560
would come along, and they would
snip out the part corresponding

01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:29.060
to here.

01:06:29.060 --> 01:06:30.470
And another would
snip out there.

01:06:30.470 --> 01:06:33.680
And another one as
an enzyme catalyzing

01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:35.600
would stick this
two pieces together.

01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:37.156
And thus you have this.

01:06:37.156 --> 01:06:39.540
This utterly bizarre
world in which

01:06:39.540 --> 01:06:41.940
genes, the vast
majority of them,

01:06:41.940 --> 01:06:45.200
are not coded for in a
continuous stretch of DNA

01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:48.220
but instead are broken up
into these separate exons.

01:06:48.220 --> 01:06:51.420
And then you need these
splicing enzymes to clip out

01:06:51.420 --> 01:06:53.742
the boring in-between
parts, the introns,

01:06:53.742 --> 01:06:55.200
stick them all
together, and you've

01:06:55.200 --> 01:06:56.990
got your functional gene.

01:06:56.990 --> 01:06:58.340
Weird.

01:06:58.340 --> 01:07:00.750
OK, but that's how
they work though.

01:07:00.750 --> 01:07:02.920
I know shortly after
these were discovered

01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:05.230
that one of the giants in
this business, guy named

01:07:05.230 --> 01:07:08.020
David Baltimore who got
the Nobel Prize for some

01:07:08.020 --> 01:07:11.280
of the work on that
reverse process of RNA

01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:13.730
viruses turning
back to DNA, he was

01:07:13.730 --> 01:07:16.950
the first to really appreciate
that what you've got here

01:07:16.950 --> 01:07:19.930
is a potential for a
lot of information.

01:07:19.930 --> 01:07:22.110
Because of, and I think
he was the first person

01:07:22.110 --> 01:07:24.950
to introduce this word into
thinking about it, because

01:07:24.950 --> 01:07:28.620
of the modular
construction of genes.

01:07:28.620 --> 01:07:33.910
Because genes come in
these separate exons.

01:07:33.910 --> 01:07:37.380
What does that begin
to allow you to do?

01:07:37.380 --> 01:07:41.530
Very important stuff.

01:07:56.490 --> 01:07:58.910
OK, so we have the
same structure here.

01:07:58.910 --> 01:08:02.190
And we have a gene coded
for in a modular way

01:08:02.190 --> 01:08:03.840
in three separate exons.

01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:08.070
And thanks to splicing enzymes,
protein catalysts clipping this

01:08:08.070 --> 01:08:10.200
out, you wind up with this.

01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:13.420
What Baltimore was the first or
one of the first to appreciate

01:08:13.420 --> 01:08:16.819
was that you could wind up
with something different

01:08:16.819 --> 01:08:18.229
there as well.

01:08:18.229 --> 01:08:21.910
You could, for example, create
a very different protein--

01:08:21.910 --> 01:08:25.970
one consisting only
of A and B. Or one

01:08:25.970 --> 01:08:29.490
consisting only of A and C.
Or one consisting of B and C,

01:08:29.490 --> 01:08:31.062
or A alone.

01:08:31.062 --> 01:08:35.870
And suddenly, you have this
combinatorial possibility

01:08:35.870 --> 01:08:40.529
of cranking out a number of
different ways of putting

01:08:40.529 --> 01:08:43.670
together-- seven different
ways since you can't transcribe

01:08:43.670 --> 01:08:46.120
this gene so that there's
no transcription-- seven

01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:49.569
different ways of combining
these different exons.

01:08:49.569 --> 01:08:51.850
Seven different
types of proteins

01:08:51.850 --> 01:08:55.350
you could generate
from the same gene.

01:08:55.350 --> 01:08:58.250
This was not accepted with
a whole lot of pleasure

01:08:58.250 --> 01:08:59.430
by the old guard.

01:08:59.430 --> 01:09:03.670
Because intrinsic in the know
the DNA sequence specifies

01:09:03.670 --> 01:09:06.050
amino acid, protein
shape, protein function,

01:09:06.050 --> 01:09:11.700
intrinsic in that is one
gene specifies one protein.

01:09:11.700 --> 01:09:15.050
One gene only specifies
a single protein.

01:09:15.050 --> 01:09:19.640
One protein is only specified,
coded for, by one gene.

01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:22.200
And suddenly, this
modular business

01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:26.460
allows you with one gene to
generate seven different kinds

01:09:26.460 --> 01:09:28.210
of proteins.

01:09:28.210 --> 01:09:31.359
For starters, how could that
possibly work that way just

01:09:31.359 --> 01:09:32.920
on a nuts and bolts level?

01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:35.770
All you need are
splicing enzymes

01:09:35.770 --> 01:09:37.670
that work a little
bit differently

01:09:37.670 --> 01:09:39.399
in different parts of the body.

01:09:39.399 --> 01:09:43.520
One that will splice
this off and is attached

01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:46.517
to an enzyme that
will degrade this,

01:09:46.517 --> 01:09:48.600
while the splicing enzyme
here-- and what have you

01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:49.520
just produced?

01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:50.810
You'll get this one.

01:09:50.810 --> 01:09:54.630
Coupling of splicing enzymes
with degradative enzymes,

01:09:54.630 --> 01:09:57.510
and suddenly you've
got a means to have

01:09:57.510 --> 01:10:01.340
tissue-specific
expression of genes.

01:10:01.340 --> 01:10:04.000
The same gene will
produce different types

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:07.120
of proteins in different
parts of the body

01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:10.930
because of splicing enzymes
working differently.

01:10:10.930 --> 01:10:13.690
Then, just to confuse
things even more,

01:10:13.690 --> 01:10:16.910
people began to note that there
would be some splicing enzymes

01:10:16.910 --> 01:10:21.010
and genes where they would
splice at a different point.

01:10:21.010 --> 01:10:25.150
And you would now have a
gene with A, and A prime,

01:10:25.150 --> 01:10:28.880
and other splicing enzymes
that would cut at other points.

01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:33.040
One single sequence of
DNA generating all sorts

01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:37.320
of different types of proteins
in different parts of the body,

01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:40.830
at different times of life,
under different circumstances,

01:10:40.830 --> 01:10:43.300
in different individuals
in different ways.

01:10:43.300 --> 01:10:47.100
Suddenly, there's a lot more
information floating around

01:10:47.100 --> 01:10:48.540
in there.

01:10:48.540 --> 01:10:52.220
So that was a huge, huge
breakthrough in the field,

01:10:52.220 --> 01:10:56.450
understanding this modular
basis of gene construction.

01:10:56.450 --> 01:10:58.700
And for our purposes
right now, what

01:10:58.700 --> 01:11:01.940
the most interesting consequence
of that is is it's no longer

01:11:01.940 --> 01:11:04.130
one gene, one protein.

01:11:04.130 --> 01:11:06.600
One gene instead can
generate all sorts

01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:09.020
of different types of
proteins, different settings,

01:11:09.020 --> 01:11:12.070
different circumstances.

01:11:12.070 --> 01:11:14.640
The next thing that was
intrinsic in this model that's

01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:17.750
now been trashed of one
continuous gene, one

01:11:17.750 --> 01:11:20.780
continuous gene-- what we just
figured out that instead you

01:11:20.780 --> 01:11:22.600
can have the introns,
exons, all of that.

01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:26.050
The next thing that went down
the tubes was looking at, Well,

01:11:26.050 --> 01:11:29.160
how much of DNA is
actually devoted

01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:32.610
to coding for amino acids?

01:11:32.610 --> 01:11:36.170
And the answer was
obvious, like 99.9% each.

01:11:36.170 --> 01:11:38.950
One of these would just have
to have a stop codon, a stop

01:11:38.950 --> 01:11:39.940
signal at the end.

01:11:39.940 --> 01:11:43.890
And otherwise, this was just a
continuous flow of information

01:11:43.890 --> 01:11:47.070
once you have factored
in these interim things.

01:11:47.070 --> 01:11:49.010
OK, so they're
part of this gene,

01:11:49.010 --> 01:11:51.240
but immediately
starts the next one.

01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:54.020
The next major
discovery was one gene

01:11:54.020 --> 01:11:58.020
would very rarely start
immediately after the next one.

01:11:58.020 --> 01:12:01.680
There would be long
stretches of DNA in between

01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:08.630
that didn't code for a
protein-- non-coding DNA.

01:12:08.630 --> 01:12:11.341
That's mighty puzzling.

01:12:11.341 --> 01:12:11.840
What's that?

01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:13.340
Just junk or stuff?

01:12:13.340 --> 01:12:15.770
And around that time,
the phrase junk DNA

01:12:15.770 --> 01:12:17.300
was actually floating around.

01:12:17.300 --> 01:12:18.970
People trying to
make sense of this.

01:12:18.970 --> 01:12:20.890
And when people sat
and started actually

01:12:20.890 --> 01:12:23.690
like doing the numbers,
out came a number

01:12:23.690 --> 01:12:27.750
that knocked people on their
rears it was so flabbergasting.

01:12:27.750 --> 01:12:33.520
95% of DNA is non-coding.

01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:40.790
95% does not code for a
gene specifying a protein.

01:12:40.790 --> 01:12:43.840
In other words, in between
here on the average

01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:47.920
would be a stretch of DNA
19 times the length of that,

01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:49.700
or whatever the
math winds up being.

01:12:49.700 --> 01:12:53.690
And suddenly calling that stuff
junk DNA starting to see me

01:12:53.690 --> 01:12:56.720
a little bit tenuous,
because 95% your DNA

01:12:56.720 --> 01:12:59.640
just can't be packing
material for the whole thing.

01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:01.710
It's got to be doing something.

01:13:01.710 --> 01:13:05.740
And during that period,
became sort of the insight

01:13:05.740 --> 01:13:10.040
into this that all the
intervening, non-coding stuff

01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:11.630
was-- what was that?

01:13:11.630 --> 01:13:13.990
That was the
instruction booklet.

01:13:13.990 --> 01:13:16.850
That was the instruction
booklet on when

01:13:16.850 --> 01:13:19.310
to activate these genes.

01:13:19.310 --> 01:13:25.660
That was the on and off switches
for turning genes on or off.

01:13:25.660 --> 01:13:28.490
Upstream in the
non-coding domain

01:13:28.490 --> 01:13:31.090
just above a particular
gene sequence

01:13:31.090 --> 01:13:35.780
would be the information for
when that gene is activated.

01:13:35.780 --> 01:13:39.230
Activated when it makes RNA
into protein, all of that.

01:13:39.230 --> 01:13:44.130
And upstream of that are
the on and off switches.

01:13:44.130 --> 01:13:49.580
Implication right there off the
bat, which is Crick was wrong.

01:13:49.580 --> 01:13:53.710
DNA sequences are not
the starting point

01:13:53.710 --> 01:13:55.680
of the central dogma of life.

01:13:55.680 --> 01:13:59.010
And DNA is the rule-giver
and all of that.

01:13:59.010 --> 01:14:00.820
DNA is being regulated.

01:14:00.820 --> 01:14:03.760
Genes are being regulated
in some other way.

01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:06.460
And where 95% of
DNA is being devoted

01:14:06.460 --> 01:14:09.640
to regulation of the genes.

01:14:09.640 --> 01:14:11.970
DNA has no idea what it's doing.

01:14:11.970 --> 01:14:15.170
DNA is a readout that's
under the control

01:14:15.170 --> 01:14:17.890
of all sorts of other factors.

01:14:17.890 --> 01:14:21.710
And out of this emerged the
really, really important

01:14:21.710 --> 01:14:30.460
concepts of regulatory
sequences upstream from genes.

01:14:30.460 --> 01:14:36.890
So here we have a long string of
DNA coding for this gene which

01:14:36.890 --> 01:14:38.680
happens to come in two exons.

01:14:38.680 --> 01:14:42.090
And it is like the
space between the galaxy

01:14:42.090 --> 01:14:45.400
how long the non-coding is going
to go on until the next gene is

01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:46.380
back there.

01:14:46.380 --> 01:14:48.120
So what's going
on in the stretch

01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:50.280
just upstream from this gene?

01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:52.340
Things that were
soon being called

01:14:52.340 --> 01:14:57.590
stuff like promoter sequences
or repressor sequences.

01:14:57.590 --> 01:15:02.400
Things, stretches of DNA,
that coded for switches

01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:04.950
rather than coding for protein.

01:15:04.950 --> 01:15:09.420
That coded for things
coming into the neighborhood

01:15:09.420 --> 01:15:14.580
of the DNA and binding to some
of these promoter or repressor

01:15:14.580 --> 01:15:19.470
sequences, and then turning
on, or in some cases off,

01:15:19.470 --> 01:15:22.620
the transcription of that
gene, the process of the gene

01:15:22.620 --> 01:15:24.340
generating proteins.

01:15:24.340 --> 01:15:27.520
You would have
promoters sitting there.

01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:30.300
And this is overly literal.

01:15:30.300 --> 01:15:32.774
It would be just
a sequence of DNA,

01:15:32.774 --> 01:15:34.440
which thanks to that
sequence would have

01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:36.830
a certain subtle microshape.

01:15:36.830 --> 01:15:39.150
And along would
come something which

01:15:39.150 --> 01:15:42.820
happened to be able to fit
perfectly into that spot.

01:15:42.820 --> 01:15:47.240
And if, and only if, this
molecule-- usually a protein--

01:15:47.240 --> 01:15:50.890
bound to this
promoter, suddenly that

01:15:50.890 --> 01:15:53.370
would trigger a whole
bunch of enzymes

01:15:53.370 --> 01:15:56.590
to come in, which would start
the process of transcribing

01:15:56.590 --> 01:15:58.190
this gene.

01:15:58.190 --> 01:16:00.810
This would be the switch,
and this is the thing

01:16:00.810 --> 01:16:03.140
that just turned the switch on.

01:16:03.140 --> 01:16:07.010
And these things that turn
these switches on, or off

01:16:07.010 --> 01:16:12.260
in some cases, were soon
called transcription factors.

01:16:12.260 --> 01:16:15.470
Totally critical concept
in there-- the fact

01:16:15.470 --> 01:16:19.030
that vast stretches of DNA
don't code for anything.

01:16:19.030 --> 01:16:22.000
Instead, they have the
instruction booklets.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.450
Here's how you turn
this gene on or off.

01:16:24.450 --> 01:16:27.430
Send in this
molecular messenger.

01:16:27.430 --> 01:16:30.520
Send in this type of
transcription factor.

01:16:30.520 --> 01:16:33.030
And if it shows
up, binds to here,

01:16:33.030 --> 01:16:35.550
you now activate
the transcription

01:16:35.550 --> 01:16:37.980
of this gene, the process
of turning that gene,

01:16:37.980 --> 01:16:40.190
making proteins derived from it.

01:16:40.190 --> 01:16:43.200
This is where the
information was.

01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:45.940
And this is not DNA
knowing what it's doing.

01:16:45.940 --> 01:16:50.200
This is outside
regulators coming in.

01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:52.440
So immediately,
that has made life

01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:54.590
a whole lot more complicated.

01:16:54.590 --> 01:16:58.290
Next complications-- you
could have different genes

01:16:58.290 --> 01:17:00.340
scattered all over
the place that

01:17:00.340 --> 01:17:04.290
would have the same
promoter upstream of it.

01:17:04.290 --> 01:17:05.860
What would that mean?

01:17:05.860 --> 01:17:08.450
In comes a transcription
factor, and it

01:17:08.450 --> 01:17:11.260
doesn't activate the
transcription of one

01:17:11.260 --> 01:17:12.820
gene producing one protein.

01:17:12.820 --> 01:17:16.930
It activates the transcription
of a whole bunch of them.

01:17:16.930 --> 01:17:20.560
In other words, now
suddenly we have messengers

01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:26.850
that could trigger activation of
genetic networks, entire arrays

01:17:26.850 --> 01:17:31.412
of proteins being produced all
with a functional similarity

01:17:31.412 --> 01:17:32.870
driven by the fact
that all of them

01:17:32.870 --> 01:17:34.970
have the same promoter upstream.

01:17:34.970 --> 01:17:37.820
So suddenly, you
have the possibility

01:17:37.820 --> 01:17:40.550
of the same promoter
being upstream

01:17:40.550 --> 01:17:42.960
regulating more than one gene.

01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:44.820
That is the general rule.

01:17:44.820 --> 01:17:49.430
Flip side of it, any
given gene, for example,

01:17:49.430 --> 01:17:52.950
could have a bunch of
different promoters responding

01:17:52.950 --> 01:17:55.210
to different types of signals.

01:17:55.210 --> 01:17:58.300
So now, suddenly,
you have this gene

01:17:58.300 --> 01:18:01.670
which can be transcribed
under this circumstance,

01:18:01.670 --> 01:18:04.870
or under this circumstance.

01:18:04.870 --> 01:18:08.770
And both are ways of turning
on activation of that gene.

01:18:08.770 --> 01:18:11.460
And in this circumstance,
the same promoter

01:18:11.460 --> 01:18:14.840
is found in Genes A, B, and
C somewhere at the other end

01:18:14.840 --> 01:18:15.970
of the chromosome.

01:18:15.970 --> 01:18:17.550
And in this case,
this promoter is

01:18:17.550 --> 01:18:22.810
found on Genes D, E, and F down
there-- different networks.

01:18:22.810 --> 01:18:26.130
So the same sort of
transcription factor logic--

01:18:26.130 --> 01:18:31.080
once you can have different
promoters upstream of a gene,

01:18:31.080 --> 01:18:33.760
and once you can have the
same promoter upstream

01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:36.730
for multiple genes, you
suddenly have the ability

01:18:36.730 --> 01:18:38.750
with different
transcription factors

01:18:38.750 --> 01:18:44.260
to activate entire networks
of gene expression.

01:18:44.260 --> 01:18:45.010
OK.

01:18:45.010 --> 01:18:46.850
So what this has
allowed you to do

01:18:46.850 --> 01:18:50.780
is completely trash this notion
of DNA knows what it's doing.

01:18:50.780 --> 01:18:52.820
DNA is just the readout.

01:18:52.820 --> 01:18:54.870
And who knows what's going on?

01:18:54.870 --> 01:18:57.910
Whatever is controlling
the transcription factors.

01:18:57.910 --> 01:19:01.670
Whatever is causing
them to do their thing.

01:19:01.670 --> 01:19:04.900
And this could be a
world of influences.

01:19:04.900 --> 01:19:07.600
And to be absolutely
accurate, this

01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:11.420
requires introducing
the word environment.

01:19:11.420 --> 01:19:13.840
This is environment
having something

01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:16.050
to do with genetic effects.

01:19:16.050 --> 01:19:19.040
This is going to be a
way in which environment

01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:23.300
is interacting with genetic
elements, environment

01:19:23.300 --> 01:19:26.162
determining which of
these are doing what.

01:19:26.162 --> 01:19:27.670
What would that look like?

01:19:27.670 --> 01:19:30.620
Sometimes environment
could be the environment

01:19:30.620 --> 01:19:32.950
in the rest of this cell.

01:19:32.950 --> 01:19:37.810
So you've got your DNA
there, and your structures,

01:19:37.810 --> 01:19:39.760
and all of that,
and the promoter.

01:19:39.760 --> 01:19:41.180
And we could do that by now.

01:19:41.180 --> 01:19:45.390
And something is occurring
inside the cell which activates

01:19:45.390 --> 01:19:47.030
some transcription factor.

01:19:47.030 --> 01:19:51.980
And then you go change a
genetic event going on in there.

01:19:51.980 --> 01:19:54.600
The cell is running
out of energy.

01:19:54.600 --> 01:19:57.670
There's various ways
to construct sensors.

01:19:57.670 --> 01:19:59.490
In other words,
evolution has come up

01:19:59.490 --> 01:20:02.450
with a bunch of different ways
in which cells can respond

01:20:02.450 --> 01:20:04.960
to signals of low
energy, and that

01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:08.300
will activate some transcription
factor which will go

01:20:08.300 --> 01:20:12.200
and bind to a bunch of promoters
which produce proteins involved

01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:16.620
in taking up more energy from
outside the cell, transporting

01:20:16.620 --> 01:20:19.040
in more, using energy
more efficiently.

01:20:19.040 --> 01:20:22.550
So what we have here is an
environmental regulation

01:20:22.550 --> 01:20:23.950
of genetic effects.

01:20:23.950 --> 01:20:28.030
Environment-- the rest of
the environment of the cell.

01:20:28.030 --> 01:20:29.870
The DNA doesn't know
what it's doing.

01:20:29.870 --> 01:20:31.660
The gene doesn't
know what it's doing.

01:20:31.660 --> 01:20:34.120
Events going on
elsewhere in the cell

01:20:34.120 --> 01:20:36.600
is what's regulating what's up.

01:20:36.600 --> 01:20:38.920
Some of the time,
the environment

01:20:38.920 --> 01:20:45.000
can be even more far flung.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.710
And in this case, it's
now events going on

01:20:47.710 --> 01:20:51.370
outside just this one cell.

01:20:51.370 --> 01:20:55.380
In this case now, you've
got the cell with it's DNA.

01:20:55.380 --> 01:20:58.890
And now, instead, you
have a chemical messenger

01:20:58.890 --> 01:21:01.440
coming from somewhere else.

01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:04.580
And binds to its receptor
like a lock and key.

01:21:04.580 --> 01:21:07.030
And as a result of
this binding, something

01:21:07.030 --> 01:21:08.909
happens here, which
does something here,

01:21:08.909 --> 01:21:10.700
which does something
here, which eventually

01:21:10.700 --> 01:21:14.130
activates some transcription
factor, which goes and does

01:21:14.130 --> 01:21:15.410
its thing.

01:21:15.410 --> 01:21:19.500
Now we have gene expression
in the cell being regulated

01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:23.200
by the environment
somewhere else in the body,

01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:24.430
somewhere else there.

01:21:24.430 --> 01:21:26.640
What would be a classic
example of that?

01:21:26.640 --> 01:21:28.650
This is what a whole
lot hormones do.

01:21:28.650 --> 01:21:30.370
Hormones go floating around.

01:21:30.370 --> 01:21:33.150
And they affect cells
everywhere throughout the body.

01:21:33.150 --> 01:21:38.040
By definition, a hormone is a
bloodborne chemical messenger.

01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:40.390
So you could secrete
some hormone out

01:21:40.390 --> 01:21:42.570
of the top of your ear,
and it will affect things

01:21:42.570 --> 01:21:43.800
in your little toe.

01:21:43.800 --> 01:21:45.420
Very far flung.

01:21:45.420 --> 01:21:48.980
Hormones will bind to their
receptors, lock and key.

01:21:48.980 --> 01:21:51.550
Most hormones are
protein in nature,

01:21:51.550 --> 01:21:56.200
and trigger what's called
a second messenger cascade.

01:21:56.200 --> 01:21:57.930
Jargon, don't worry about it.

01:21:57.930 --> 01:21:59.450
Just get it conceptually.

01:21:59.450 --> 01:22:01.740
Activate some
transcription factor,

01:22:01.740 --> 01:22:03.540
deactivate some other
transcription factor.

01:22:03.540 --> 01:22:08.190
And suddenly, events going
on 14 counties over there

01:22:08.190 --> 01:22:12.020
are regulating what proteins
are being made in this cell.

01:22:12.020 --> 01:22:13.990
What would be an
example of that?

01:22:13.990 --> 01:22:15.850
Testosterone, for example.

01:22:15.850 --> 01:22:17.970
Testosterone secreted
from the testes,

01:22:17.970 --> 01:22:21.710
traveling far and wide and
eventually binding to androgen

01:22:21.710 --> 01:22:24.150
receptors on muscle.

01:22:24.150 --> 01:22:27.180
And what happens there is
through a pathway like this,

01:22:27.180 --> 01:22:30.450
turning on the activation of
genes, coding for proteins,

01:22:30.450 --> 01:22:33.200
all sorts of structural
proteins that will

01:22:33.200 --> 01:22:35.260
make that muscle cell bigger.

01:22:35.260 --> 01:22:38.560
Your muscles are getting
bigger thanks to testosterone.

01:22:38.560 --> 01:22:39.440
Look at this.

01:22:39.440 --> 01:22:43.150
Events occurring a gazillion
cells away in the testes,

01:22:43.150 --> 01:22:46.960
a messenger here, determining
what gene expression,

01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:49.850
what gene activation
is happening.

01:22:49.850 --> 01:22:52.350
Sometimes, though,
the environment

01:22:52.350 --> 01:22:57.855
could be completely
outside the organism.

01:23:02.160 --> 01:23:03.600
Like that.

01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:07.530
Sometimes you can have,
for example, a messenger

01:23:07.530 --> 01:23:09.180
from the outside world.

01:23:09.180 --> 01:23:10.570
What sort of messenger?

01:23:10.570 --> 01:23:12.210
A scary sight.

01:23:12.210 --> 01:23:14.900
A bit of sensory
information or whatever.

01:23:14.900 --> 01:23:16.540
Olfactory.

01:23:16.540 --> 01:23:20.160
Olfactory-- suppose
some odorant comes in.

01:23:20.160 --> 01:23:24.400
A pheromone-- you're female rat
who has recently given birth,

01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:27.040
and the pheromones
from your babies

01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:31.760
come floating in and
bind to receptors here.

01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:33.680
Very similar principle, again.

01:23:33.680 --> 01:23:36.350
And that causes them to activate
something, activate something,

01:23:36.350 --> 01:23:37.530
and some cell down there.

01:23:37.530 --> 01:23:39.890
And eventually
there is a cell here

01:23:39.890 --> 01:23:42.190
that controls some
muscles, and it

01:23:42.190 --> 01:23:44.560
makes your eyes
dilate because you

01:23:44.560 --> 01:23:46.487
love the smell of your baby.

01:23:46.487 --> 01:23:49.070
And you're just-- I don't know
if rats have their eyes dilate.

01:23:49.070 --> 01:23:52.820
But humans will in many
other circumstances.

01:23:52.820 --> 01:23:54.660
Aha, how do you do that?

01:23:54.660 --> 01:23:58.030
You just changed some structural
proteins that did this or that.

01:23:58.030 --> 01:24:01.610
Or suddenly this
female is making

01:24:01.610 --> 01:24:05.170
some hormone like oxytocin as
a result of smelling her baby.

01:24:05.170 --> 01:24:06.370
What have we got here?

01:24:06.370 --> 01:24:10.560
We got something going on in
the outside world regulating

01:24:10.560 --> 01:24:12.430
what's going on with the genes.

01:24:12.430 --> 01:24:15.730
Genes as the central
dogma of life,

01:24:15.730 --> 01:24:18.800
as the information
giver-- nonsense.

01:24:18.800 --> 01:24:21.000
Events going on in
the rest of the cell,

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.410
the rest of the organism,
the rest of the universe,

01:24:23.410 --> 01:24:26.340
are determining
when genes activate.

01:24:26.340 --> 01:24:30.540
So what we see now is a
much more interesting world

01:24:30.540 --> 01:24:33.560
of regulation of
gene expression.

01:24:33.560 --> 01:24:37.700
First, the modular
ability for one gene

01:24:37.700 --> 01:24:40.750
to generate all sorts of
different proteins, which

01:24:40.750 --> 01:24:42.930
brings up an issue after
a while is, does that

01:24:42.930 --> 01:24:44.040
count as one gene?

01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:45.940
And people argue over that.

01:24:45.940 --> 01:24:50.560
And because of this 95%
regulatory sequence business,

01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:54.560
the most interesting
stuff going on with DNA

01:24:54.560 --> 01:25:00.080
is not what the protein is
like, not what the protein does,

01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:02.350
not how well the
protein does it,

01:25:02.350 --> 01:25:06.570
but when it does it,
in what contexts.

01:25:06.570 --> 01:25:10.870
And what we've just
introduced are if then clauses

01:25:10.870 --> 01:25:12.620
into this whole world.

01:25:12.620 --> 01:25:17.010
If you get a signal that there
is low glucose in the cell,

01:25:17.010 --> 01:25:21.130
then you begin to make proteins
related to glucose uptake.

01:25:21.130 --> 01:25:24.640
If you have the smell
of your child come in,

01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:26.680
then you activate
this [? path. ?]

01:25:26.680 --> 01:25:29.560
It's not changing what
the protein is like.

01:25:29.560 --> 01:25:31.430
It's changing context.

01:25:31.430 --> 01:25:34.910
And I think what we will see
is context is vastly more

01:25:34.910 --> 01:25:37.780
interesting than whether this
protein is a little bit more

01:25:37.780 --> 01:25:39.510
like this, a little
bit more like that.

01:25:39.510 --> 01:25:42.650
If it is being expressed
instead at a different time,

01:25:42.650 --> 01:25:45.620
in a different place,
in a different context,

01:25:45.620 --> 01:25:48.160
that's much more interesting.

01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:50.760
So what does that
set us up for here?

01:25:50.760 --> 01:25:53.200
Now beginning to see the
organization of this.

01:25:53.200 --> 01:25:56.170
By the way-- 95%,
this whole stuff here.

01:25:56.170 --> 01:25:58.050
I don't know what
percentage is accounted

01:25:58.050 --> 01:26:01.830
for by identified promoters,
and repressors, and stuff.

01:26:01.830 --> 01:26:03.760
But it's a tiny percentage.

01:26:03.760 --> 01:26:06.800
What that means is there's
regulatory stuff going on

01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:08.500
that no one has a clue about.

01:26:08.500 --> 01:26:12.690
The main thing, though,
here is modulatory structure

01:26:12.690 --> 01:26:16.650
to genes-- introns, exons--
and this whole world

01:26:16.650 --> 01:26:18.940
of the environment
regulating when

01:26:18.940 --> 01:26:21.080
genes are turned on and off.

01:26:21.080 --> 01:26:23.410
A whole world where
you could generate

01:26:23.410 --> 01:26:25.730
completely different proteins.

01:26:25.730 --> 01:26:27.730
Not a protein that's a
little bit more this way,

01:26:27.730 --> 01:26:32.850
a little bit more that way, in
completely different contexts.

01:26:32.850 --> 01:26:34.720
So all we need to
do now is begin

01:26:34.720 --> 01:26:39.740
to stick this into the
molecular biology of mutations

01:26:39.740 --> 01:26:42.090
and evolutionary change.

01:26:42.090 --> 01:26:45.650
Where does this begin?

01:26:45.650 --> 01:26:47.440
Oh, no, before we
do that, that's not

01:26:47.440 --> 01:26:48.400
what we're going to do.

01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:51.450
We're going to look at one
more level of regulation here.

01:26:51.450 --> 01:26:55.820
OK, so you've got your DNA.

01:26:55.820 --> 01:26:58.050
And we already know
this whole business.

01:26:58.050 --> 01:26:59.906
What's telling it what to do.

01:26:59.906 --> 01:27:02.720
You can have transcription
factors coming in,

01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:05.220
all of that, these
interesting implications.

01:27:05.220 --> 01:27:06.870
DNA-- let's see.

01:27:06.870 --> 01:27:13.190
For our purposes, protected
in sort of layers of protein

01:27:13.190 --> 01:27:15.820
that are just sort of
structurally stabilizing.

01:27:15.820 --> 01:27:18.140
This is not really what
they look like or quite

01:27:18.140 --> 01:27:21.190
what they're made of, but
they're called chromatin.

01:27:21.190 --> 01:27:23.870
There's this stuff that
stabilizes the DNA.

01:27:23.870 --> 01:27:26.370
Because these are
wispy little things.

01:27:26.370 --> 01:27:28.860
And one of the things that,
of course, they need to do

01:27:28.860 --> 01:27:32.170
is they're in wrapped
around the DNA stabilizing.

01:27:32.170 --> 01:27:34.920
You've got some transcription
factor coming in from somewhere

01:27:34.920 --> 01:27:35.990
else in the cell.

01:27:35.990 --> 01:27:39.970
It's got to be able to
get down to the DNA.

01:27:39.970 --> 01:27:44.240
And thus, you have a whole
world of chomatin opening up

01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:47.710
to allow transcription
factors to get through.

01:27:47.710 --> 01:27:51.430
And thus, you have a whole world
of what's telling the chromatin

01:27:51.430 --> 01:27:53.660
to open up where and when?

01:27:53.660 --> 01:27:57.620
Suddenly, a whole
world of regulation,

01:27:57.620 --> 01:27:59.340
of whether the
transcription factors

01:27:59.340 --> 01:28:02.610
even have access to the DNA.

01:28:02.610 --> 01:28:05.990
So you can have tons of
a transcription factor,

01:28:05.990 --> 01:28:08.770
and all set to transcribe
something off of this.

01:28:08.770 --> 01:28:13.710
And thanks to conformational
changes, folding or unfolding

01:28:13.710 --> 01:28:16.490
of chromatin, you're regulating
whether the transcription

01:28:16.490 --> 01:28:18.510
factor can even get through.

01:28:18.510 --> 01:28:20.680
And thus, there's a
whole world of stuff

01:28:20.680 --> 01:28:24.720
that changes chromatin
modeling and remodeling.

01:28:24.720 --> 01:28:28.460
Additional step here, one
that's really interesting,

01:28:28.460 --> 01:28:31.510
is you can do things--
circumstances [? arise, ?]

01:28:31.510 --> 01:28:34.280
the environment can do
things-- where you change

01:28:34.280 --> 01:28:39.200
the structure of chromatin
around a particular gene

01:28:39.200 --> 01:28:41.230
in a way that makes it
easier to transcribe,

01:28:41.230 --> 01:28:42.500
or harder to transcribe.

01:28:42.500 --> 01:28:45.980
And you can essentially
make that change permanent.

01:28:45.980 --> 01:28:48.360
You could permanently
do something

01:28:48.360 --> 01:28:50.660
in some particular
stretch of chromatin

01:28:50.660 --> 01:28:53.840
so it will never open up again
to allow the transcription

01:28:53.840 --> 01:28:55.670
factor in.

01:28:55.670 --> 01:28:57.710
And what you have
just done-- jargon--

01:28:57.710 --> 01:29:01.710
is you have silenced that gene.

01:29:01.710 --> 01:29:04.520
You've silenced it permanently.

01:29:04.520 --> 01:29:08.180
And people know a lot of the
mechanisms for how this occurs.

01:29:08.180 --> 01:29:09.910
For those who care
about such things,

01:29:09.910 --> 01:29:11.769
the process is
called methylation.

01:29:11.769 --> 01:29:13.060
This is a little bit different.

01:29:13.060 --> 01:29:14.780
That's occurring
with the DNA itself.

01:29:14.780 --> 01:29:19.470
But this is silencing of
genes by structural access

01:29:19.470 --> 01:29:22.150
of transcription factors to it.

01:29:22.150 --> 01:29:23.840
When does that occur?

01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:27.310
There's all sorts of
circumstances early in life

01:29:27.310 --> 01:29:30.910
where you will change the
permanent accessibility

01:29:30.910 --> 01:29:34.370
of some gene and
transcription factors.

01:29:34.370 --> 01:29:37.930
You will cause long-term,
lifelong changes.

01:29:37.930 --> 01:29:39.610
As but one example,
and one that we

01:29:39.610 --> 01:29:42.600
will look at a number of
times down the pike there,

01:29:42.600 --> 01:29:47.230
in rats, the mothering
style of the mother rats,

01:29:47.230 --> 01:29:51.270
will cause chromatin
changes-- permanent ones--

01:29:51.270 --> 01:29:54.580
in some of the genes
related to stress hormones.

01:29:54.580 --> 01:29:57.180
So that certain types of
mothering-- how often you

01:29:57.180 --> 01:30:00.370
lick the baby, and other
rat mother type stuff--

01:30:00.370 --> 01:30:04.000
will regulate how readily
some genes will be turned

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.360
on for the rest of your life.

01:30:06.360 --> 01:30:08.310
This is early experience.

01:30:08.310 --> 01:30:12.390
This is molecular mechanisms
for events early in life

01:30:12.390 --> 01:30:13.870
lasting forever.

01:30:13.870 --> 01:30:16.120
A lot of these turn out to
be a little bit reversible.

01:30:16.120 --> 01:30:18.530
But for our purposes,
lasting forever.

01:30:18.530 --> 01:30:22.930
This is a whole new
field called epigenetics.

01:30:22.930 --> 01:30:26.370
Genetics is all
about DNA sequences.

01:30:26.370 --> 01:30:30.300
Epigenetics is all
about regulation

01:30:30.300 --> 01:30:34.330
of access to DNA sequences,
things of that sort.

01:30:34.330 --> 01:30:37.030
So suddenly this
epigenetic world

01:30:37.030 --> 01:30:41.240
is entirely capable of
overriding anything going on

01:30:41.240 --> 01:30:43.532
at the transcription factor end.

01:30:43.532 --> 01:30:45.795
Just to give you a sense
of this-- researcher.

01:30:45.795 --> 01:30:47.920
This is a guy at the National
Institute of Health--

01:30:47.920 --> 01:30:50.640
a guy named Steve
Sumi who studies

01:30:50.640 --> 01:30:52.360
primate social behavior.

01:30:52.360 --> 01:30:55.980
And what he has
shown is in monkeys,

01:30:55.980 --> 01:30:59.850
in one part of their
brain, you change the style

01:30:59.850 --> 01:31:03.090
of mothering that that monkey
is subject to as a baby,

01:31:03.090 --> 01:31:06.650
and you will change the
conformational access

01:31:06.650 --> 01:31:10.720
state of 4,000 different genes.

01:31:10.720 --> 01:31:13.610
Enormously influential there.

01:31:13.610 --> 01:31:18.350
Enormous arrays of ways of
regulating where it's not

01:31:18.350 --> 01:31:21.290
genetics, it's epigenetics.

01:31:21.290 --> 01:31:25.250
And this has given rise to a
great phrase-- fertilization

01:31:25.250 --> 01:31:27.590
is all about genetics.

01:31:27.590 --> 01:31:30.930
Development is all
about epigenetics.

01:31:30.930 --> 01:31:33.120
And what epigenetics
is about are

01:31:33.120 --> 01:31:37.100
ways in which the environment
not only can regulate what's

01:31:37.100 --> 01:31:38.840
going on with this
gene right now,

01:31:38.840 --> 01:31:42.350
but can cause lifelong
differences in the ability

01:31:42.350 --> 01:31:45.130
to access genes.

01:31:45.130 --> 01:31:49.240
So this is an enormous array
of levels of regulation.

01:31:49.240 --> 01:31:52.110
Splicing enzymes
determining how your exons

01:31:52.110 --> 01:31:54.030
get mixed and matched,
generating all sorts

01:31:54.030 --> 01:31:55.260
of different proteins.

01:31:55.260 --> 01:31:58.130
Transcription factors
representing the things

01:31:58.130 --> 01:32:01.550
that turn the switches on and
off, and the array of switches

01:32:01.550 --> 01:32:04.860
is far more interesting and
plentiful than the gene itself.

01:32:04.860 --> 01:32:06.850
Transcription factors
reflecting what's

01:32:06.850 --> 01:32:10.550
going on in the outside world,
like in the rest of the cell

01:32:10.550 --> 01:32:12.290
to the other side of the planet.

01:32:12.290 --> 01:32:15.160
And finally, this
whole additional level

01:32:15.160 --> 01:32:19.230
of regulation where some of
the regulatory consequences

01:32:19.230 --> 01:32:20.940
here can be lifelong.

01:32:20.940 --> 01:32:24.350
Enormous array of
levels of regulation.

01:32:24.350 --> 01:32:26.890
And an enormous number
of ways in which

01:32:26.890 --> 01:32:29.200
just the DNA sequence
of the gene itself

01:32:29.200 --> 01:32:31.380
is not very interesting.

01:32:31.380 --> 01:32:34.100
That determines the
shape of the protein.

01:32:34.100 --> 01:32:36.340
All this other
stuff is where is it

01:32:36.340 --> 01:32:38.430
expressed, when is
it expressed, in what

01:32:38.430 --> 01:32:41.550
contexts, what sort of
if then contingencies,

01:32:41.550 --> 01:32:45.210
whether it is ever expressed
after a certain childhood

01:32:45.210 --> 01:32:45.810
event.

01:32:45.810 --> 01:32:49.810
All of that much much
more interesting.

01:32:49.810 --> 01:32:53.710
So what we need to
do now is transition

01:32:53.710 --> 01:32:57.510
to thinking about
evolution, mutations,

01:32:57.510 --> 01:33:00.310
on the level of all the
stuff we just heard about.

01:33:00.310 --> 01:33:03.790
And all I will leave you with
and picking up on Wednesday,

01:33:03.790 --> 01:33:09.820
is think about what if you get
a mutation in a splicing enzyme?

01:33:09.820 --> 01:33:13.810
What if you get a mutation
in a transcription factor?

01:33:13.810 --> 01:33:17.340
What if you get a mutation
not in the letters

01:33:17.340 --> 01:33:21.000
coding for a gene, but
coding for a promoter?

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.320
What happens in all those cases?

01:33:23.320 --> 01:33:26.010
And suddenly you
begin to see a world

01:33:26.010 --> 01:33:30.130
in which you can get stuff
that's not purely gradual.

01:33:30.130 --> 01:33:33.380
