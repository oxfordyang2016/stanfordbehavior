00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:05.855
Stanford University.

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:13.630
Let's see.

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:15.530
Various announcements.

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.734
I am out of town tomorrow,
so no office hours.

00:00:18.734 --> 00:00:22.380
I managed effortlessly to
confuse a whole bunch of people

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.810
Monday about positive selection
versus stabilizing selection.

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.735
All of that on the Q&amp;A
part of the course works.

00:00:30.735 --> 00:00:33.370
I've pulled out the paragraphs
from the extended readings

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.783
that explain that coherently, as
opposed to what happened here.

00:00:36.783 --> 00:00:40.170
And Monday-- Monday I discovered
that somebody sitting in this

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.040
room, who I cannot
spot at the moment,

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.600
has a spectacular tattoo
illustrating the central dogma

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.360
of life, or at least one person.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.870
If there's two, it's
really something.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.200
So amazing demonstration
of DNA to RNA to protein.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.640
So if the person doesn't
have a class afterward,

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.050
he will be standing up
on top of this counter

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.680
here displaying
it for everybody's

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.599
educational purposes.

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:08.240
So besides finding about that
guy, what else happened Monday?

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.190
Monday we introduced
two concepts

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:14.430
and, with great
dramatic foreshadowing,

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.220
started to trash both.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.750
The first one being
this huge emphasis

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.580
in all of the preceding lectures
on the evolution of behavior--

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.410
not only this emphasis
on adaptation,

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.900
not only this emphasis on
inferring a genetic basis

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.370
through that roundabout--
here's a story

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.700
and until you make up
a better one, I win.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.780
But also that emphasis
on gradualism,

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.220
that slow evolutionary change.

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.560
What we focused
on there was what

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.720
would be the mechanisms,
the molecular mechanisms,

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.300
for classic gradualist
evolutionary change,

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.910
microevolution, the whole world
of point mutations-- deletion,

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.660
insertion, all of that, the
whole world of mutations

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.462
potentially being big news,
knocking a protein completely

00:02:01.462 --> 00:02:02.920
out of business
and suddenly you've

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.290
got a different gender than
you actually are chromosomally,

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.940
but a world, none the less,
where for our soundbite,

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.660
micromutations are affecting
how readily a protein does

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.930
its job-- how strongly,
how potently, how long,

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.610
what its job is,
all of that, that

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.600
as sort of the grist for the
microevolutionary change.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.490
What we then transitioned
to was the huge, huge attack

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.650
on the gradualism that
came with this view

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.030
of punctuated
equilibrium, this notion

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.160
that most of the time, nothing
exciting was happening,

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.660
long periods of stasis, and
then sudden, dramatic change

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.580
proposed by Gould, other
evolutionary people.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.360
And what we saw was
the huge implication.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.220
There it was.

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.490
If most of the time,
nothing interesting

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.650
is happening in terms
of evolutionary shift,

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.500
there goes
gradualism, there goes

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.480
the emphasis of every
bit of adaptation

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.990
is going to make a difference
long term, every, opportunity

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:01.430
to compete, compete
and dominate,

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:02.680
is going to make a difference.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.370
All of that goes down the
drain if 99% of the time,

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.460
there is instead
equilibrium stasis.

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.140
What we saw were the wildly
enthused attacks upon it

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.790
along the grounds of that
stasis and rapid change

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.220
for paleontologists
bears no resemblance

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.450
to what the world is like for
an evolutionary biologist.

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.880
Paleontologists can only see
the evolution of boring stuff--

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:26.990
morphology.

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:29.840
You miss the entire
world of what's going on

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.540
inside that morphology.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.020
And the most damning
sort of complaint,

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.220
show me some
molecular mechanisms

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.790
for these
macroevolutionary changes.

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.420
What we then transitioned
to was seeing all the ways

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.450
in which the picture of the
structure of genes and DNA

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.110
is completely wrong along
the lines of there's

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.860
the intervening sequences,
the intron/exon organization

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:53.570
of genes.

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:56.270
Suddenly the opportunity
to mix and match

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:00.060
combinatorial abilities for
one gene, or at least one

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.090
stretch of DNA, to
specify a whole bunch

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.960
of different proteins, depending
on the function of the splicing

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.200
enzymes, and those
splicing enzymes

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.370
differing in different
parts of the body

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.110
under different circumstances.

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.429
We then saw that flabbergasting
business about 95% of DNA

00:04:17.429 --> 00:04:21.450
not coding for proteins, not
being genes, but instead,

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.410
the instruction manuals,
the promoters, the switching

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.110
on and off, leading to
that critical notion

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.870
of transcription factors
transducing events going on

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.760
out there, out there outside
the nucleus, outside the cell,

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.150
outside the organism,
into changes in DNA,

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.270
and thus the incredibly
important role of transcription

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:42.480
factors, promoters.

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.650
There are a lock and
key interactions.

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.930
All that sorts of
stuff introducing

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:50.270
the second critical
concept-- if microevolution

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:55.870
is about sort of changing the
function of a protein, changes

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:58.130
occurring at the level
of transcription factors

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:00.300
or promoters, those
are about changing

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.660
the context for which
proteins are functioning

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.030
when genes are expressing.

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:09.110
What they are about are
introducing if/then clauses.

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.920
If this is happening outside
the nucleus, cell, universe,

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:16.817
whatever, then if that results
in this gene being activated,

00:05:16.817 --> 00:05:18.150
then you will see that response.

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.910
What came along sort
of de facto with that,

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:23.560
the second major thing
that we thus trashed,

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.970
was DNA as the central starting
point, the dogma of life.

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.440
DNA is the only one who knows
what's going on out there.

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.950
DNA commands, RNA commands,
protein commands all of life.

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:38.960
And what we saw was DNA,
genes, are just a readout

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.050
and most of what it's about
is environmental regulation

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.170
of when genes activate.

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:48.740
Finally we began to see all
sorts of ways of futzing around

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.950
with gene expression
that has nothing

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:54.020
to do with the sequences
of DNA, but instead

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:58.060
has to do with things like
access of transcription factors

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:01.700
to the DNA, changing
accessibility permanently,

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:05.820
that whole world of
epistatic, epigenetic changes,

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:07.970
coming up with that
sound soundbite.

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:10.530
Fertilization is about genetics.

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:13.620
Development is about
epigenetics-- all of that

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:16.320
combining to show,
number one, genes

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:19.460
are not such a hot deal in
terms of them knowing what's up.

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.470
Number two, in
addition to mechanisms

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:24.360
known for
microevolutionary change,

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:28.540
we left just on the cusp of
seeing how all of this stuff

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:32.450
can set you up for some big
time macroevolutionary changes.

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:33.620
First example of it.

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:35.490
First way in which
that could occur.

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:38.180
So back to the modular
construction of genes.

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.330
We've got our introns,
exons, all of that.

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:42.350
And what we learned
the other day is here

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:45.290
we've got a gene coded
for with three exons.

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:48.760
You produce a messenger
RNA that encompasses

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:50.600
all of these plus the introns.

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:54.970
Along comes a specific splicing
enzyme, knocks out these parts,

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:57.210
and here is the mature protein.

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:58.550
So that's great.

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:03.040
What if you have a mutation
in your splicing factor,

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:06.060
in your splicing
enzyme, and as a result,

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:09.740
instead of clipping here,
it ignores those and clips

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:10.600
here instead.

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:11.720
What do you get?

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:14.150
You get two completely
novel proteins

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:18.220
that never existed before in
this cell, in this individual.

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:21.240
What you've got there
is not some sort

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:23.420
of little
microevolutionary change.

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:26.490
This is not a protein
working a little bit better

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:27.775
or a little bit more sluggish.

00:07:27.775 --> 00:07:31.130
This is the invention of
entirely new proteins.

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:35.190
So what we see here is splicing
factors working differently.

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:39.050
And this is a major
change, if whatever

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:42.500
went on in the outside world
that causes the then of this

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:45.890
being made, if you've got
that mutation in the splicing

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:48.680
factor, you've just made
entirely new if/then.

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:50.930
If whatever's going on
in the outside world

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:54.410
happens to activate this,
you produce these two novel

00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:55.700
proteins.

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:57.750
So we've suddenly
got the potential

00:07:57.750 --> 00:07:59.850
for producing all
sorts of novelty.

00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:04.300
They're splicing enzymes,
enzymes, proteins, thus there

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:07.610
are genes coding for
the splicing enzymes.

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:11.090
As a result, suddenly a very
different type of consequence.

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:12.242
Yeah, question?

00:08:12.242 --> 00:08:16.600
How often do those [INAUDIBLE]
make it out of the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:17.480
Great question.

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:20.390
How often do they make
their way out of the--

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:21.930
[INAUDIBLE]

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:23.080
What was that?

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:26.510
How often do the
mis-splice [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:28.960
successfully have function?

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:30.640
Do they have any function?

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:32.010
[INAUDIBLE]

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:33.780
That's a critical question.

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:36.330
Wait about an hour
and 17 minutes

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:38.659
and you will get the answer
to it-- the answer being,

00:08:38.659 --> 00:08:39.750
not very often.

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:40.440
Oops.

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:41.130
I gave it away.

00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:42.685
The answer being not very often.

00:08:42.685 --> 00:08:44.059
And we're going
to see why that's

00:08:44.059 --> 00:08:47.900
real critical to
punctuated equilibrium.

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:50.630
So we see one realm
of major consequence.

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:54.630
And intrinsic in that is,
wait a second-- so if splicing

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:56.840
enzymes, enzymes are genes.

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:59.430
There's a gene for
the splicing enzyme.

00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:01.950
And that gene has its promoters.

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:04.910
And that gene maybe is
in a number of exons.

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:07.080
And thus it needs
a splicing factor.

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:09.620
And we're rolling all
the way down there.

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:11.580
Recursive regulation.

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:14.300
So one splicing factor,
big consequence.

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:17.290
Next realm where you can
have a big consequence

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:21.400
is now you've got a
mutation in a promoter.

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:26.490
A whole world of a mutation in
a noncoding part of your DNA.

00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:29.190
And you can immediately
run with that one.

00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:31.270
Have a different
promoter, and it's

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:34.450
going to interact with a
different transcription factor.

00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:38.580
And we go back to that business
about typically a promoter,

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:42.300
the same version of it, multiple
copies of that promoter,

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:46.030
appear upstream of various
different genes-- promoters

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:50.460
mediating expression of
entire network of proteins.

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:54.330
Change that promoter and you're
going to change the network.

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:57.110
Change that promoter in
only some of the places

00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:59.710
where it occurs and
now you've created

00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:02.810
a completely novel network,
a network consisting maybe

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:04.970
of half of the proteins
that you would have

00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:06.930
made in the unmutated version.

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:08.890
Mutate every single
version of it,

00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:11.910
and maybe it's an entirely
different transcription

00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:14.840
factor that interacts
with that promoter.

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:18.820
And thus we've made an
entirely new if/then clause--

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:22.990
not just a new if/then make
a never seen before protein.

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:26.330
Now it's an if this
happens, then make

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:29.240
a network of proteins that
have never existed before,

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:32.450
a combination of these that
have never occurred before.

00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:34.240
What we're beginning
to see here is

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:36.940
a theme of amplifying affects.

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:39.880
Huge, major
consequences, instead of

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:42.680
one little protein which,
thanks to one little base pair

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:45.330
changing, is 1 and
1/2 degrees more

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:47.090
folded this way
instead of that way

00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:50.680
and 1.5% better at binding
this or that hormone.

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:54.960
That's the microevolutionary
this is setting up

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:57.250
for big network changes.

00:10:57.250 --> 00:11:02.120
Novel genes, novel networks,
novel if/then clauses.

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:06.020
Third range-- an example of
why promoters and promoter

00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:07.220
mutations are interesting.

00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:09.470
Later on in the course, we
are going to hear about one

00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:12.290
of the all time
interesting differences

00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:14.380
that you can have in
one of your promoters

00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:18.040
if you happen to be a vole and,
increasingly it's turning out,

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:20.480
equally interesting if
you happen to be a human.

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:24.160
This is a promoter
upstream of a gene

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:27.340
having to do with the
hormone vasopressin.

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:30.550
Do not panic or care if you
haven't heard of this yet.

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:32.950
But you will have in more
detail within a few weeks.

00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:36.310
Vasopressin is this
hormone which has something

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:41.430
or other to do with social
affiliated behavior in males

00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:43.620
and all sorts of
interesting stuff with that.

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:45.980
And naturally, it
being a hormone,

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:48.640
out there is a
vasopressin receptor.

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:51.760
And thus, there's a
vasopressin receptor gene.

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:54.250
And there's a promoter
upstream of that gene

00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:57.730
which turns out to come in a
couple of different flavors.

00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:02.180
And you look at voles, which
are a little hamster thingee

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:02.990
sort of things.

00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:04.990
And there's all sorts of
different vole species.

00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:06.460
And there's ones
in the mountains,

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:08.251
and there's ones in
the plains, and there's

00:12:08.251 --> 00:12:11.794
ones from California to
the New York islands.

00:12:11.794 --> 00:12:13.460
And there's all these
different species.

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:16.860
And it happens some of them
happened to be monogamous.

00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:19.000
Some of them happen
to be polygamous.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.130
We're off and running with
the social biology of that

00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:25.080
and how many imprinted genes and
all that they're going to have.

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:29.260
But a critical difference
in monogamous vole species--

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.700
there is a different
promoter upstream

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:34.330
of the vasopressin
receptor gene than you

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:37.650
find in the polygamist ones.

00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:39.870
And go and mess
around with them,

00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:43.500
use gene therapy techniques
to change the promoter

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:48.720
to modify it, and you could
convert a polygamous male vole

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:51.142
into a resoundingly
monogamous one.

00:12:51.142 --> 00:12:53.100
And I don't know if this
counts as gene therapy

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:56.370
like curing a disease or just
gene transfer sort of stuff,

00:12:56.370 --> 00:12:59.440
but what you've got here
is change your promoter

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:02.030
and you suddenly have
a different pattern

00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:04.680
of expression, which parts
of the brain it winds up in.

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:07.880
Suddenly you have made a
major shift in behavior.

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:10.480
You're not causing
a change in a gene.

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:12.330
You're causing a
change in its promoter.

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:16.070
You've just changed a
major if/then clause.

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:18.670
Another example of
it-- there is a gene

00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:21.880
that codes for hormone
neurotransmitter that

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:25.680
has something to do with pain
perception called dynorphin.

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:29.190
It's broadly related to
things like morphine and such.

00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:31.761
It's got a dynorphin gene
that's a little more complicated

00:13:31.761 --> 00:13:32.260
than that.

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:33.820
But there's a promoter upstream.

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:38.460
And recent research is showing
that the number of copies

00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:41.750
of that promoter
in different rats

00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:45.000
predicts something about how
readily they become addicted

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.920
to various drugs.

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:49.440
And that winds up
being pertinent.

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:50.190
Back for a second.

00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:52.380
Back to the vasopressin
gene and the vasopressin

00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:54.480
reporter gene and it's promoter.

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:58.120
In the last couple of years,
a number of studies come out.

00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:01.040
One, for example, in a
very credible journal

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:02.940
by a great group
showing that if you

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:07.830
happen to be a human male,
which version of that promoter

00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:10.960
you have gives you a certain
significant predictive power

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:15.536
over how stable your social
relationships are going to be.

00:14:15.536 --> 00:14:17.380
Get a load of that one.

00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:19.940
And that one is coming later on.

00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:20.640
Whoa.

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:24.370
Have a different type of
promoter and statistically

00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:29.170
you are more likely to get
divorced down the line.

00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:32.090
Back to that first
lecture freewill stuff.

00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:34.520
There is so much more to
come along those lines.

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:36.430
We will look at the
vasopressin system

00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:38.140
much more in the sex lectures.

00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:41.120
But again, that's not
a difference in a gene.

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:43.430
That's a difference
in the promoter.

00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:47.570
Next domain-- we've now seen
changes, subtle changes,

00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:49.770
dramatic changes,
in splicing enzymes

00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:53.000
and the genes underlying
them, changes in promoters.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.960
Next obvious domain where you
can get a macro, macro change

00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:00.930
is a mutation in a gene
for a transcription factor,

00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:02.120
obviously.

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:06.200
Do that and you're going to have
completely different networks.

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:10.000
Once again, you will have
changed if/then contingencies

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.040
dramatically.

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:15.440
Transcription factors are very,
very important, obviously.

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:17.750
One measure of
this-- when you look

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:20.660
at the human genome
versus the chimp genome,

00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:24.550
and we will eventually do that
in some detail and say, 98%

00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:27.180
of our genes in common,
which is kind of accurate.

00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:29.610
And you remember from the
other day how that's different.

00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:31.350
It's the level of
explanation than you

00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:33.740
sharing 50% of your genes
with your full sibling.

00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:34.610
All of that.

00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:39.040
Back to us sharing 90%,
98% of our DNA with chimps.

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:40.660
What are the differences?

00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:43.460
And there's going to be some
really interesting differences

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:45.560
we're going to focus
on down the line.

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:47.300
But one of the patterns
that's come out

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:50.510
of that is a
disproportionate share

00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:53.930
of the genetic differences
between humans and chimps

00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:57.930
are genes that code for
transcription factors.

00:15:57.930 --> 00:16:00.450
And that makes perfect sense.

00:16:00.450 --> 00:16:03.420
You get a change
in some gene coding

00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:06.160
for some structural
protein and maybe

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:08.700
your muscles will bend
a little bit this way

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:10.450
instead of that way,
or who knows what.

00:16:10.450 --> 00:16:13.600
You get a change in the gene
coding for transcription factor

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:17.360
and you will have invented
all sorts of novel networks.

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:20.110
So a disproportionate
share of what

00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:23.600
has gone on in evolution
differentiating us from chimps

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:26.310
are changes in
transcription factors.

00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:29.130
This was a big
triumph, big support,

00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:31.140
for a view that came
out in the '80s.

00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:34.350
There were a pair of scientists
at Berkeley, King and Wilson,

00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:36.980
and this iconic set
of studies they did.

00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:39.370
They were the first
persons, people,

00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:42.750
to come up with a
98% business there.

00:16:42.750 --> 00:16:45.720
And using very primitive
molecular techniques

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:47.860
that have since been
affirmed-- and they also

00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:51.050
came up with a prediction, a
purely theoretical one, which

00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:55.160
is, the most interesting changes
that will occur in evolution

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:59.620
are in regulatory parts of
DNA rather than in the coding

00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:00.930
parts for protein.

00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:03.030
And everything since
then has supported

00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:05.220
that, including
things like, you want

00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:08.569
to turn an ancestor
of a human and a chimp

00:17:08.569 --> 00:17:10.420
into something that
will look a whole lot

00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:12.569
different from a
chimp, turn into us,

00:17:12.569 --> 00:17:15.800
change stuff with
regulation, transcription

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:18.400
factors, promoters.

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:21.780
What you see with that
is this is endlessly

00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:25.212
networks for amplifying
effects for macro changes.

00:17:25.212 --> 00:17:27.670
And there's a new person in
the department, Bio department,

00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:29.890
Hunter Frazier, a new
assistant professor,

00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:32.470
who works in this
area showing just how

00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:34.880
much evolutionary
change is being driven

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:39.040
by change in regulatory
parts of the DNA world,

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:40.910
rather than the genes itself.

00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:45.160
Changing a little bit about how
this protein works, that's OK.

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:48.760
Changing if/then clauses
for entire networks,

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:50.470
that's hugely important.

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:52.360
Another interesting
factoid-- there's

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:54.420
now been the genomes
of, I don't know,

00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:57.630
about 100 different species
sequenced, and ranging

00:17:57.630 --> 00:18:00.680
from really short
genomes with I don't

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:04.240
know how many genes in
there, to the longest ones.

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:06.660
When you pile them up
and you look at them

00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:09.320
as a function of how
long their genomes are,

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:13.310
the more genes you find
in a species, the greater

00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:16.460
the percentage of
those genes are

00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:18.640
that are transcription factors.

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:22.360
And this makes
wonderful sense as well.

00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:26.570
You got one gene and you only
need one transcription factor.

00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:30.480
You got two genes and you could
milk maximal information out

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:32.430
of them with three
transcription factors.

00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:36.010
You transcribe A or B, or AB.

00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:38.400
You've got three genes
and there's seven.

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:41.171
And the equation
is 2 to the nth.

00:18:41.171 --> 00:18:41.670
This one.

00:18:41.670 --> 00:18:42.300
Whatever.

00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:45.960
But what you see is by four
genes, you're up to 15.

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:48.890
By five genes, you're
up to 30-- you're

00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:53.460
having an exponential, a
dramatic increase in the number

00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:56.860
of transcription factors
you need to take advantage

00:18:56.860 --> 00:19:01.070
of all the possible combinations
of networks of gene expression.

00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:04.760
The larger the number of
genes you find in an organism,

00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:08.690
the greater the percentage it
is of transcription factors.

00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:13.150
In other words, get tiny
little micro, micro changes

00:19:13.150 --> 00:19:16.870
in DNA coding for transcription
factor splicing, enzymes,

00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:20.820
promoters, and you're going to
have big major consequences.

00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:25.150
So over and over here, we see
this contrast microevolution is

00:19:25.150 --> 00:19:27.320
about the function of proteins.

00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:30.600
Macroevolution is
about which proteins--

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:35.990
when networks' if/then clauses
are far more consequential.

00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:38.800
One additional
domain of-- we're not

00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:41.060
talking about a tiny
little micro change

00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:43.600
in one base pair--
one additional domain,

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:47.700
a highly revolutionary one that
came some years ago that also

00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:49.790
has lots of implications
for thinking

00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:52.160
about macro stuff in evolution.

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:56.840
And this revolved around one of
the great irresistible musical

00:19:56.840 --> 00:20:00.640
dramas that have ever come
out of the history of science.

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:03.340
Once that is-- there's got
to be a musical somewhere

00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:06.910
in the future of this-- having
to do with a scientist named

00:20:06.910 --> 00:20:08.840
Barbara McClintock.

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:10.340
Barbara McClintock--
if you are sort

00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:13.770
of a modern molecular sort of
person, at some point or other,

00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:17.420
you will have to have sacrificed
a goat at the altar of Barbara

00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:18.400
McClintock.

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:22.110
She is so amazing and she
has such a stirring story

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:25.150
as to what happened with her,
one which actually is so.

00:20:25.150 --> 00:20:29.190
Barbara McClintock was born, I
don't know, about 1900 or so,

00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:32.800
and was a plant
geneticist and was sort of

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:36.910
off doing genetics of plants
and doing something or other

00:20:36.910 --> 00:20:37.470
with maize.

00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:38.940
Whatever those people do.

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:41.760
And she was
extremely successful.

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:44.050
She was wildly successful.

00:20:44.050 --> 00:20:47.424
I think at age 40 or
so in the late 1930s,

00:20:47.424 --> 00:20:48.840
she was already a
member of what's

00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:51.500
called the National
Academy of Sciences, which

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:54.880
is like the most honorific
science club you can belong to

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:55.890
in this country.

00:20:55.890 --> 00:20:59.070
40-year-old women
in 1940 were not

00:20:59.070 --> 00:21:01.800
becoming members of the
National Academy of Sciences.

00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:05.040
110-year-old white guys
with shiny foreheads

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:07.150
were becoming members
of the National Academy.

00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:09.620
For her to have been
elected at that point,

00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:12.900
she was an amazing scientist,
one of the absolute leaders

00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:13.770
in the field.

00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:16.400
So she's cruising along
there, being renowned.

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:19.440
And one day she made a
discovery that completely

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:21.160
destroyed her career.

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:25.850
So she's sitting there one day
and she studies beloved corn

00:21:25.850 --> 00:21:28.030
maize and the patterns
of inheritance

00:21:28.030 --> 00:21:30.050
based on colors of kernels.

00:21:30.050 --> 00:21:33.590
Genes, molecular biology,
like nonexistent.

00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:35.260
None of the stuff available now.

00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:37.470
All you could do in
terms of making sense

00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:40.590
of what is being inherited,
patterns of inheritance,

00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:43.050
is just looking
at the phenotype,

00:21:43.050 --> 00:21:44.560
looking at the appearance.

00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:47.134
Peas and whether they're
wrinkly or not, people

00:21:47.134 --> 00:21:48.800
and whether they're
wrinkly or not, corn

00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:51.690
and what the colors are of
the various kernels there.

00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:56.500
That was cutting edge molecular
sort of genetics at the time.

00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:59.900
So she's working in that domain
and she's seeing a result.

00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:02.290
She's seeing a
pattern of inheritance

00:22:02.290 --> 00:22:05.340
which keeps popping up
in certain circumstances.

00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:08.330
And you go through all of
the inferential math that

00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:10.820
was available and you
crunch through everything.

00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:14.490
And you, if you were Barbara
McClintock pursuing this,

00:22:14.490 --> 00:22:17.400
you come up with a conclusion
that is totally nutty.

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:21.790
The only way to explain how
this change was occurring

00:22:21.790 --> 00:22:26.510
was if genes were picking up
and moving around on the DNA,

00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:30.250
if gene were jumping around,
if genes were mobile,

00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:31.270
moving around.

00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:33.470
And out of this, she
came up with a proposal

00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:37.620
that there are such things
as transposable genes,

00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:41.100
transposable genetic
elements, transposons.

00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:44.420
All of the people who spent
decades afterward mocking her

00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:46.900
in various ridiculing
tones of voices

00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:49.200
soon referred to these
as jumping genes.

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:51.080
And the general
consensus in the field

00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:53.830
was that Barbara McClintock
had gone out of her mind.

00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:56.020
Yeah, genes jumping around.

00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:56.826
Yeah, right.

00:22:56.826 --> 00:22:58.200
I'll sell you the
Brooklyn Bridge

00:22:58.200 --> 00:22:59.408
after that if you believe it.

00:22:59.408 --> 00:23:00.790
That's ridiculous.

00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:02.180
That's ridiculous.

00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:07.010
And Barbara McClintock, having
a certain stoic self-esteem

00:23:07.010 --> 00:23:10.620
sort of based personality of
one that was-- basically said,

00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:12.040
you know what?

00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:13.332
This is what I see.

00:23:13.332 --> 00:23:14.790
You want to believe
it, believe it.

00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:16.250
You don't want to believe
it, don't believe it.

00:23:16.250 --> 00:23:18.450
Leave me alone, I want to
go back to my experiments.

00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:21.690
And she essentially
disappeared from the field

00:23:21.690 --> 00:23:24.020
and just sat out
in her cornfield

00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:27.080
at a lab in Long Island
called Cold Spring Harbor lab,

00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:30.230
and just chugged along on her
own for decades afterward.

00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:33.060
She wrote papers about it
that were incomprehensible

00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:35.260
to people, because
no one could believe

00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:36.740
anything this ridiculous.

00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:39.000
And she was developing
this whole story

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.990
about genes that move,
transposable genetic elements.

00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:44.350
Everybody ignored her.

00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:45.460
She was mocked.

00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:46.700
She was pilloried.

00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:48.431
She was burned at the stake.

00:23:48.431 --> 00:23:48.930
All of that.

00:23:48.930 --> 00:23:52.880
And then finally somewhere in
the 1980s, molecular techniques

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:57.020
caught up enough to show
she was absolutely right.

00:23:57.020 --> 00:24:00.410
And these things now
are called transposons.

00:24:00.410 --> 00:24:02.510
Transposable genetic elements.

00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:05.470
Genes really do pick
up and move around.

00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:08.520
And this was an amazing
landmark discovery.

00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:11.840
The entire world went crazy
about Barbara McClintock

00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:12.580
at the time.

00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:16.971
She was on the cover of Post's
Wheaties boxes of cereal.

00:24:16.971 --> 00:24:17.470
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:19.790
There were Barbara
McClintock lines

00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:26.600
of dance clothes and exercise
videos and recipe books

00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:27.480
and all of that.

00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:30.890
And somewhere along the way,
they gave her her Nobel Prize.

00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:32.710
And she was in her
late 80s at the time.

00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:35.330
And showing exactly the
stuff she was made out of,

00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:37.570
she said, well, that's nice.

00:24:37.570 --> 00:24:38.950
Thanks for the Nobel Prize.

00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:40.230
But you know what?

00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:42.360
I didn't really need
to have gotten it.

00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:43.600
This is what I saw.

00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:45.070
You want to believe
it, yes or no?

00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:46.050
You believe it now?

00:24:46.050 --> 00:24:46.685
That's nice.

00:24:46.685 --> 00:24:47.630
Leave me alone.

00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:48.940
Let me go back to work.

00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:49.440
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:53.000
And she continued to work in
her cornfields doing experiments

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.450
up until about a week before
her death in the early '90s.

00:24:56.450 --> 00:24:59.660
This is a totally
cool, amazing figure

00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:02.662
in the history of
science, a lonely pioneer.

00:25:02.662 --> 00:25:04.870
As it turned out, she wasn't
that lonely of a pioneer

00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:07.150
and people didn't think
she was quite that crazy.

00:25:07.150 --> 00:25:08.720
And apparently a
lot of her papers

00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:11.350
were ignored because
she could not write

00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:13.640
and her papers were
incomprehensible.

00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:15.800
But nonetheless,
the general picture

00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:18.380
was, she discovered
all of this on her own,

00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:21.180
staked her career on
this, and most people

00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:24.290
thought she was out of her
mind and eventually vindicated.

00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:27.370
Totally cool sort of piece
of the history of science.

00:25:27.370 --> 00:25:30.410
Really, really
inspirational person.

00:25:30.410 --> 00:25:34.100
And I met her once
and got to see her

00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:35.661
with her corn and she was--

00:25:35.661 --> 00:25:36.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:39.870
A remarkable-- she was like 90
at the time-- and a remarkably

00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:43.695
nice, low-key person, where
after about 13 and a half

00:25:43.695 --> 00:25:45.820
seconds, it was obvious
that what she mostly wanted

00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:47.444
was for me to get
the hell out of there

00:25:47.444 --> 00:25:49.580
so she could go back
to her corn, which

00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:51.600
was her response
to everybody there.

00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:53.720
But very heroic figure.

00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:56.780
So she discovers
this entire new world

00:25:56.780 --> 00:25:59.870
of these transposable
genetic elements.

00:25:59.870 --> 00:26:03.890
And people have been studying
it since, these jumping genes.

00:26:03.890 --> 00:26:05.630
The first thing that
has become clear

00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:09.740
as the field ha matured is
she picked the right species

00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:10.660
to study.

00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:14.960
She never would have discovered
transposable genetic elements

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:17.120
if she was out there
alone in her cornfield

00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:20.830
studying sperm
whales or something.

00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:23.014
Separate of the funding
problems and the logistics,

00:26:23.014 --> 00:26:24.180
she would not have found it.

00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:28.510
She did it in the right
organisms, which were plants.

00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:29.900
Think about it.

00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:31.030
You are an animal.

00:26:31.030 --> 00:26:34.030
And one of the things you can do
is, when the going gets tough,

00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:37.930
you can get up and run away, or
you can crawl away or fly away

00:26:37.930 --> 00:26:41.770
or whatever sort of animate
animal type things can do.

00:26:41.770 --> 00:26:44.170
If you're a plant,
you're stuck there.

00:26:44.170 --> 00:26:45.630
You can't run away.

00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:47.440
And if you're going to
survive a challenge,

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:49.023
you're going to have
to have something

00:26:49.023 --> 00:26:51.530
more subtle going for
you than, oh, let's run

00:26:51.530 --> 00:26:52.690
and get out of here.

00:26:52.690 --> 00:26:56.230
And it turns out all sorts
of realms of plant stress

00:26:56.230 --> 00:27:00.840
responses are in just the avant
garde of molecular biology.

00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:03.490
Plants have to
have fancier tricks

00:27:03.490 --> 00:27:07.850
than all sorts of boring animals
because plants don't run away.

00:27:07.850 --> 00:27:10.900
What they do instead, among
their various defenses, when

00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:15.140
a challenge, a pathogen, a
climate change, whatever it is

00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:17.140
comes along, one of
the things they do

00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:21.410
is there's realms of their DNA
where they move genes around,

00:27:21.410 --> 00:27:25.040
where they shuffle stuff around
in the hopes of stumbling

00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:29.320
onto something novel and useful
to get them out of that mess.

00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:33.160
Plants have induce-able
events of genes moving

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:35.240
transposable genetic elements.

00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:38.210
They tend to induce
them when the plant is

00:27:38.210 --> 00:27:42.020
under some sort of challenge,
a cellular stress response.

00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:44.070
And the way that's
done is by activating

00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:46.880
an enzyme called transposase.

00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:49.270
And those of you who are
new to the business, enzymes

00:27:49.270 --> 00:27:51.990
tend to have -ase
the end of the word--

00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:55.430
lactase, sucrase, transposase.

00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:57.850
And what you've
got there is, this

00:27:57.850 --> 00:27:59.570
is a defense on the
part of the plant.

00:27:59.570 --> 00:28:02.020
Juggle some of
its DNA prudently,

00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:04.710
and see if you can come up
with something to help you.

00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:06.930
Make a copy of
the gene, and then

00:28:06.930 --> 00:28:09.690
go plunk it down somewhere
else and see if you've

00:28:09.690 --> 00:28:11.960
stumbled into something useful.

00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:14.030
And it was only in the
aftermath that people

00:28:14.030 --> 00:28:17.640
started to look at the
same issue in animals

00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:19.340
and vertebrates and mammals.

00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:22.430
And shockingly to
everyone, except the people

00:28:22.430 --> 00:28:25.640
who hung out with her, was the
fact that we've got them, too.

00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:28.960
We've got transposable
genetic elements, we animals.

00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:29.880
We've got them.

00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:35.370
Where they were first discovered
made a lot of sense as well.

00:28:35.370 --> 00:28:38.350
You are some scientists
and you've just

00:28:38.350 --> 00:28:43.080
invented in your lab some
pathogen, some toxin,

00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:45.980
some who knows what, that
has never been seen before

00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:47.690
in the history of the planet.

00:28:47.690 --> 00:28:49.590
You've synthesized
it and you inject it

00:28:49.590 --> 00:28:51.130
in a whole bunch of people.

00:28:51.130 --> 00:28:53.730
And they get totally
sick and miserable.

00:28:53.730 --> 00:28:56.790
And then you come back two
weeks later, two months later,

00:28:56.790 --> 00:29:00.210
and they will have made
antibodies against that thing.

00:29:00.210 --> 00:29:02.000
Their body, their
immune systems,

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.990
will have made antibodies
against some invasive pathogen

00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:09.380
thingee that never
existed before

00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:10.950
in the history of the planet.

00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:15.150
And a staggering challenge
is how does the immune system

00:29:15.150 --> 00:29:17.970
come up with this
vast variability

00:29:17.970 --> 00:29:19.900
for dealing with
novel pathogens,

00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:23.380
making antibodies that
will recognize them?

00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:26.180
And people soon discovered
one of the tricks

00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:29.490
was splicing of genes
relevant to making

00:29:29.490 --> 00:29:33.050
antibodies and juggling
them around-- induce-able,

00:29:33.050 --> 00:29:36.170
transposable events--
in the hope of making

00:29:36.170 --> 00:29:39.140
a gazillion new
types of antibodies

00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:42.030
in a remarkable filtering
process that goes on

00:29:42.030 --> 00:29:44.560
in the immune system,
spotting are any of them

00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:47.490
good against this new
thing that just showed up?

00:29:47.490 --> 00:29:50.550
That's where you had a
lot of transposable events

00:29:50.550 --> 00:29:54.970
in the vertebrate immune system
in response to novel pathogens.

00:29:54.970 --> 00:29:56.812
Turns out, we
weren't the only ones

00:29:56.812 --> 00:29:58.770
doing that because there
were other things that

00:29:58.770 --> 00:29:59.561
could be happening.

00:29:59.561 --> 00:30:01.980
There were all sorts
of the pathogens that

00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:03.840
could do the same exact thing.

00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:07.700
There is one tropical
parasite, Trypanosome, which

00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:09.420
is one you do not want to get.

00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:12.770
And trypanosomiasis is
the inflammatory disease

00:30:12.770 --> 00:30:15.600
you get from a
trypanosome, this parasite,

00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:17.870
and it shows up in your
body, and your body

00:30:17.870 --> 00:30:19.950
does this induce-able
trick and, thank god,

00:30:19.950 --> 00:30:22.220
comes up with some
antibodies that could begin

00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:24.340
to target it and attack it.

00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:26.830
But trypanosomes also
worship at the altar

00:30:26.830 --> 00:30:28.130
of Barbara McClintock.

00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:31.010
What they do is, a
couple of weeks into it,

00:30:31.010 --> 00:30:34.710
they take away the surface
proteins on their surface

00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:37.470
and they juggle some
of the relevant DNA

00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:40.100
and come up with a
novel version of it.

00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:43.110
So just as you've got
the antibodies online,

00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:45.450
you can't recognize the
thing with those antibodies.

00:30:45.450 --> 00:30:47.920
You've got to start the
process all over again.

00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:51.590
And thus trypanosomes are
always a couple steps ahead,

00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:53.210
thus the immune
system has to have

00:30:53.210 --> 00:30:56.120
evolved better ways of juggling,
coming up with novel stuff.

00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:58.350
Co-evolutionary races there.

00:30:58.350 --> 00:31:01.580
But the cornerstone
of it is inducing

00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:03.835
movable genetic elements.

00:31:03.835 --> 00:31:05.460
And what people have
learned since then

00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:09.020
is it occurs outside of
just the immune system

00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:11.520
and under interesting
circumstances.

00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:16.260
One really amazing one, which
I was going to tell you later

00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:18.840
but I will tell you now because
I just can't wait-- there

00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:21.360
is one transposable
element that's

00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:23.330
very predominant in primates.

00:31:23.330 --> 00:31:27.350
And there is a certain cell
type and a certain time of life

00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:31.550
when it is most mobile, when it
moves around the most-- which

00:31:31.550 --> 00:31:35.260
is, the cells in your brain
that are going to be making

00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:39.600
new neurons, neural
progenitor cells, at the time

00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:42.800
that they start proliferating
and making new neurons.

00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:45.620
There is an induce-able
event at that time

00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:49.310
where you increase the movement
of that one genetic element.

00:31:49.310 --> 00:31:50.660
What are you doing?

00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:52.420
You're making some new neurons.

00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:55.120
And, as it turns out, in
a fairly controlled realm

00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:58.760
of your DNA, you decide to
shuffle the deck a little bit

00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:01.990
just because you want to get
the interesting novel sort

00:32:01.990 --> 00:32:04.190
of things that neurons can do.

00:32:04.190 --> 00:32:06.060
This is totally amazing.

00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:08.570
This is totally amazing because,
among other things, what

00:32:08.570 --> 00:32:11.520
this tells you is the
cells in your body

00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:15.010
that have the greatest thing to
do with making you who you are,

00:32:15.010 --> 00:32:18.480
are the least constrained
by genetic determinism.

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:21.130
Because right when these
types of cells, neurons,

00:32:21.130 --> 00:32:22.890
are first being
generated, they're

00:32:22.890 --> 00:32:25.270
doing more shuffling
of genetic cards

00:32:25.270 --> 00:32:27.390
than any other cell
type in the body.

00:32:27.390 --> 00:32:30.050
That sure takes away
the power of genes a lot

00:32:30.050 --> 00:32:31.690
when it comes to
the nervous system.

00:32:31.690 --> 00:32:35.690
These transposable events make
a whole lot of variability,

00:32:35.690 --> 00:32:37.826
some of which is wonderful.

00:32:37.826 --> 00:32:39.700
Some of which is not,
and this is coming back

00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:43.470
to the question that was asked
before, are these disastrous?

00:32:43.470 --> 00:32:45.440
In most of the cases, yes.

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:49.210
But in a few minutes, we'll see
exactly why it is not likely

00:32:49.210 --> 00:32:51.670
that when you randomly
shuffle a bunch of cards,

00:32:51.670 --> 00:32:55.190
they're going to come out in
a perfect sequence of numbers

00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:56.280
or some such thing.

00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:59.130
It is a long shot to get
something interesting out

00:32:59.130 --> 00:32:59.640
of it.

00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:02.590
Nonetheless, this is a
mechanism for doing this.

00:33:02.590 --> 00:33:06.510
What this allows you to
do by moving parts of DNA

00:33:06.510 --> 00:33:10.610
around, making a copy of this
stretch and then moving it

00:33:10.610 --> 00:33:12.960
and, I think-- I don't
know the field that well,

00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:15.050
but I think, at
least in most cases,

00:33:15.050 --> 00:33:18.150
the notion is it plunks
down randomly somewhere else

00:33:18.150 --> 00:33:19.010
in the genome.

00:33:19.010 --> 00:33:24.370
By moving stuff around, you can
have big macro consequences.

00:33:24.370 --> 00:33:31.150
For example, suppose
you've got, by now,

00:33:31.150 --> 00:33:33.540
and if/then clause
introducing this concept

00:33:33.540 --> 00:33:36.310
already-- if/then clause,
and we can translate

00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:39.720
this totally primitively
into worlds of promoters

00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:42.370
and worlds of the actual gene.

00:33:42.370 --> 00:33:44.340
So you've got an if/then clause.

00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:46.290
Suppose you are dehydrated.

00:33:46.290 --> 00:33:49.220
If you were dehydrated,
translating that

00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:52.555
into actual biology, I
don't know, your hematocrit

00:33:52.555 --> 00:33:56.400
or how wrinkly your kidneys
are getting or some such thing.

00:33:56.400 --> 00:34:00.120
Then tell your kidneys to
start doing something or other

00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:03.160
that kidneys do to retain
water, which I once understood

00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:04.910
for a finale, no longer do.

00:34:04.910 --> 00:34:07.140
But you wake them up and
they have some response.

00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:08.900
So we've got an if/then clause.

00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:13.120
If you were getting dehydrated,
then make your kidneys work

00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:15.270
in a way that increases
water retention.

00:34:15.270 --> 00:34:16.570
This is ridiculous.

00:34:16.570 --> 00:34:19.790
There is if you are getting
dehydrated promoter.

00:34:19.790 --> 00:34:22.110
There is no gene
that is equivalent.

00:34:22.110 --> 00:34:23.989
There's networks, though.

00:34:23.989 --> 00:34:25.530
There's networks,
and there's ways

00:34:25.530 --> 00:34:28.889
in which your kidney monitors
that and other outposts

00:34:28.889 --> 00:34:29.739
in your body.

00:34:29.739 --> 00:34:31.954
So we have a rough
if/then clause.

00:34:31.954 --> 00:34:33.620
Wouldn't take a whole
lot of imagination

00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:35.699
to turn that into real biology.

00:34:35.699 --> 00:34:39.290
Now suppose you have
some transposable events.

00:34:39.290 --> 00:34:43.600
Suppose whatever it is,
the promoter world of that,

00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:47.070
picks up and moves
and the if you

00:34:47.070 --> 00:34:50.260
were dehydrated part of the
if/then clause floats around.

00:34:50.260 --> 00:34:53.440
It gets plunked down
upstream from the genes

00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:55.830
that say go and ovulate.

00:34:55.830 --> 00:34:58.040
What have you just invented?

00:34:58.040 --> 00:35:00.270
What does this allow you to do?

00:35:00.270 --> 00:35:02.700
So now you've got an
if/then clause, a promoter

00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:06.050
of that response to
dehydration, and it turns

00:35:06.050 --> 00:35:09.390
on genes related to ovulation.

00:35:09.390 --> 00:35:10.960
What does that get for you?

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:11.615
Any ideas?

00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:16.384
Oh, come on.

00:35:16.384 --> 00:35:18.040
Ovulate really frequently.

00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:18.790
Ovulate--

00:35:18.790 --> 00:35:19.540
Really frequently.

00:35:19.540 --> 00:35:21.230
Really frequently.

00:35:21.230 --> 00:35:22.680
Depends on your threshold.

00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:26.110
If like you should be-- skip
orange juice in the morning,

00:35:26.110 --> 00:35:28.660
does that mean you're
dehydrated enough to ovulate.

00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:31.130
You could set it at a very
low threshold like that.

00:35:31.130 --> 00:35:31.892
You could do that.

00:35:31.892 --> 00:35:33.350
You could do
something else though.

00:35:33.350 --> 00:35:34.485
What else?

00:35:34.485 --> 00:35:34.984
[INAUDIBLE]

00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:42.080
You're about to
die of dehydration

00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:43.590
and that gives you
one last chance

00:35:43.590 --> 00:35:46.010
for a round of passing
on copies of your genes,

00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:48.350
if you could find some
guy who isn't dehydrated

00:35:48.350 --> 00:35:52.215
to dramatic blood flow extent.

00:35:52.215 --> 00:35:53.090
That's a possibility.

00:35:53.090 --> 00:35:54.452
What else can you do?

00:35:54.452 --> 00:35:55.690
Seasonal mating.

00:35:55.690 --> 00:35:57.940
Yes, seasonal mating.

00:35:57.940 --> 00:35:59.510
That's what it's
mostly used for.

00:35:59.510 --> 00:36:01.430
Certainly possibilities here.

00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:02.970
But what this
allows you-- you're

00:36:02.970 --> 00:36:05.660
a species where six months
of the year it's dry

00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:08.280
and six months of the year
it's wonderful wet and lush

00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:10.850
and exactly the time you
want to be having a baby.

00:36:10.850 --> 00:36:13.600
And you've got like a six
month gestational period.

00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:14.560
What do you want?

00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:17.810
You want your body to know
when it's the dry season,

00:36:17.810 --> 00:36:21.120
and that's the signal to mate,
because you want to give birth

00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:22.510
during the rainy season.

00:36:22.510 --> 00:36:27.570
And then there's species where
you are pregnant for two weeks

00:36:27.570 --> 00:36:28.180
or so.

00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:30.055
And what you want to
have there as a rule is,

00:36:30.055 --> 00:36:32.382
oh my god, if it's the
dry season, don't ovulate,

00:36:32.382 --> 00:36:34.590
because I'm going to give
birth to kids who are going

00:36:34.590 --> 00:36:36.190
to starve or some such thing.

00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:38.660
Let's wait until I
get a signal that I'm

00:36:38.660 --> 00:36:40.840
totally wet and hydrated.

00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:41.640
Then ovulate.

00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:44.360
You introduce novel
if/then clauses.

00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:46.140
And for certain
species, this would

00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:49.190
be how you would do
seasonal mating-- how

00:36:49.190 --> 00:36:51.690
to know you should
obviously at a time of year

00:36:51.690 --> 00:36:53.992
where, given your
gestation length,

00:36:53.992 --> 00:36:55.700
it's going to set you
up for giving birth

00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:57.550
at the time of year
when your offspring are

00:36:57.550 --> 00:36:58.625
most likely to survive.

00:36:58.625 --> 00:37:01.170
And thus, you will have passed
on copies of your genes.

00:37:01.170 --> 00:37:01.780
All of that.

00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:02.810
So that's great.

00:37:02.810 --> 00:37:04.290
Another example.

00:37:04.290 --> 00:37:06.390
And this one is
immediately accessible

00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:09.390
and is a first crude
way of beginning

00:37:09.390 --> 00:37:12.820
to approach some of this stuff
that just flowed seamlessly

00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:14.550
and cheaply in the
forms of theories

00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:16.190
from last week's stuff.

00:37:16.190 --> 00:37:20.050
So you have some
if/then element in there

00:37:20.050 --> 00:37:23.030
and a promoter
which, in some way,

00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:27.120
can tell this individual
near me smells like me.

00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:29.780
And we will see, by
next week, exactly how

00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:31.660
that translates into genetics.

00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:35.020
But this individual kind
of smells a lot like me.

00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:38.070
And it has an if/then clause
which immediately shuts down

00:37:38.070 --> 00:37:43.230
transcription of all sorts of
things related to fertility.

00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:45.040
You don't mate with relatives.

00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:48.560
Some sort of incest taboo runs
through a gazillion species

00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:49.390
out there.

00:37:49.390 --> 00:37:52.910
Individuals smelling like
you, if you were a hamster,

00:37:52.910 --> 00:37:55.210
make you much less
likely to mate with them.

00:37:55.210 --> 00:37:57.450
So a very logical
if/then clause.

00:37:57.450 --> 00:37:58.430
All that works great.

00:37:58.430 --> 00:38:02.170
And now you've had a
transposable genetic event.

00:38:02.170 --> 00:38:06.230
And you plunk down the,
if it smells like me then,

00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:09.980
into upstream of the
gene that says cooperate.

00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:11.620
And what have we just invented?

00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:13.520
The starts of kin selection.

00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:15.790
And you could see all
sorts of rules like,

00:38:15.790 --> 00:38:17.990
if you have more
promoters, you could

00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:20.810
begin to have subtleties
of saying, if they really,

00:38:20.810 --> 00:38:24.190
really smell a lot like me,
like if all these promoters are

00:38:24.190 --> 00:38:27.710
going off at once, then really,
really, really cooperate.

00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:30.890
If they smell only somewhat like
me, only somewhat cooperate.

00:38:30.890 --> 00:38:32.780
You could begin
to fine tune that.

00:38:32.780 --> 00:38:34.330
What have you just invented?

00:38:34.330 --> 00:38:37.160
A way of taking
sensory information

00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:39.700
about degree of related-ness
and turning that

00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:43.720
into your extent of sacrificing
for one sibling or eight

00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:44.760
cousins.

00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:48.670
So you could begin to see how
you invent new if/then clauses.

00:38:48.670 --> 00:38:50.960
Obviously this is ridiculous.

00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:53.060
Obviously this bears
no relationship

00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:55.020
to what's going on
in the real world.

00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:57.290
This would be happening
in nose cells.

00:38:57.290 --> 00:39:00.910
This is occurring
down in the ovaries.

00:39:00.910 --> 00:39:04.840
There is no promoter that
responds to, oh, somebody

00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:06.230
here is smelling like me.

00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:08.790
But there are some that do stuff
not all that far from that.

00:39:08.790 --> 00:39:11.650
You could begin to
imagine turning this

00:39:11.650 --> 00:39:14.820
into real biology, how you
could program for this.

00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:17.090
And once you've got
genes moving around,

00:39:17.090 --> 00:39:19.700
you've plunked a promoter
down someplace else.

00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:22.900
You've just made a
new if/then clause.

00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:26.390
Now the possibilities is of
transposing genetic elements,

00:39:26.390 --> 00:39:30.630
also raises the possibility
of moving around

00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:34.450
parts of genes-- not just
parts of regulatory elements--

00:39:34.450 --> 00:39:36.280
moving around parts of genes.

00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:37.340
How would you do that?

00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:38.930
How would you move
a part of a gene?

00:39:38.930 --> 00:39:39.650
Exons.

00:39:39.650 --> 00:39:41.870
That's that modular
construction of genes

00:39:41.870 --> 00:39:44.760
again, where if you
get a transposase

00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:46.540
that comes and does
its thing there,

00:39:46.540 --> 00:39:49.970
and in making a copy of this,
moves this stretch around,

00:39:49.970 --> 00:39:53.610
you're now moving copies
of parts of genes around.

00:39:53.610 --> 00:39:55.930
And you can relate new genes.

00:39:55.930 --> 00:39:59.400
For example, here we
have the basic mechanism

00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:02.190
of action of steroid hormones.

00:40:02.190 --> 00:40:04.140
You guys who need an
introduction to that,

00:40:04.140 --> 00:40:05.810
we'll get it in a week or two.

00:40:05.810 --> 00:40:09.000
Steroid hormones--
hormones like estrogen,

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:12.190
progesterone, testosterone,
glucocorticoids.

00:40:12.190 --> 00:40:14.420
All of these, they
work as follows.

00:40:14.420 --> 00:40:17.000
Steroid hormones can
enter a target cell

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.540
and they bind to their receptor.

00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:19.650
Yes, indeed.

00:40:19.650 --> 00:40:20.430
Lock and key.

00:40:20.430 --> 00:40:21.325
All that happens.

00:40:21.325 --> 00:40:24.437
Steroid hormones are
not made of amino acids.

00:40:24.437 --> 00:40:25.770
They have a different structure.

00:40:25.770 --> 00:40:28.400
But nonetheless, each
has a distinctive shape.

00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:32.300
And each type of receptor
for a type of steroid hormone

00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:35.595
has a distinctive shape driven
by its amino acid sequence

00:40:35.595 --> 00:40:36.470
and those gene codes.

00:40:36.470 --> 00:40:37.260
All of that.

00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:40.490
So you've got a specific type
of steroid hormone fitting

00:40:40.490 --> 00:40:43.180
into its specific type
of receptor-- estrogen

00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:45.860
into an estrogen receptor,
that sort of thing.

00:40:45.860 --> 00:40:47.740
And what it does
as a result is it

00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:50.130
activates this receptor complex.

00:40:50.130 --> 00:40:53.360
And on the other side
of it, is a confirmation

00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:59.070
which recognizes a particular
promoter down on the DNA.

00:40:59.070 --> 00:41:03.330
A, in this case, what would be
called an estrogen responsive

00:41:03.330 --> 00:41:04.155
promoter.

00:41:04.155 --> 00:41:05.280
So what have you got there?

00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:08.020
You've got events going
on in the outside world.

00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:11.150
You are reading the
right parts of some novel

00:41:11.150 --> 00:41:13.380
and suddenly you're
secreting certain hormones

00:41:13.380 --> 00:41:14.600
that weren't there before.

00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:18.420
And you're changing genomic
effects shortly afterward.

00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:21.530
This is environment
regulating genes like crazy.

00:41:21.530 --> 00:41:23.230
What is this requiring?

00:41:23.230 --> 00:41:26.470
One part of the receptor
recognizing the hormone,

00:41:26.470 --> 00:41:27.560
specifically.

00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:30.260
And one part of the
receptor recognizing

00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:33.250
its specific
appropriate promoter.

00:41:33.250 --> 00:41:37.010
So now along comes one of
those transposable events.

00:41:37.010 --> 00:41:38.810
And it happens,
steroid hormones--

00:41:38.810 --> 00:41:42.580
this would be called the
hormone binding domain.

00:41:42.580 --> 00:41:45.700
And this would be called
the DNA binding domain.

00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:49.080
In steroid receptor genes,
those are in different exons.

00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:53.420
And suppose along comes
a transposable event.

00:41:53.420 --> 00:41:56.120
And you clip this part
off and you stick it

00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:58.530
in a different hormone
binding domain.

00:41:58.530 --> 00:42:01.990
So you've just made a completely
different if/then clause.

00:42:01.990 --> 00:42:05.240
If this hormone is
around, then do this.

00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:08.670
Now suddenly instead it's,
if this hormone is around,

00:42:08.670 --> 00:42:09.870
then do this.

00:42:09.870 --> 00:42:11.210
New if/then clause.

00:42:11.210 --> 00:42:13.400
Here would be one possibility.

00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:15.030
One of the class of
steroid hormones,

00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:17.780
glucocorticoids,
which eventually you

00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:21.010
will come to love because you
will hear endlessly about it.

00:42:21.010 --> 00:42:24.520
And glucocorticoids,
they're stress hormones.

00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:26.280
Human version of hydrocortisone.

00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:27.970
For our purposes
right now, what's

00:42:27.970 --> 00:42:31.790
interesting about them is they
suppress the immune system.

00:42:31.790 --> 00:42:34.880
These are steroidal
anti-inflammatories.

00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:37.010
When you're taking
non-steroidals,

00:42:37.010 --> 00:42:39.240
you're taking things that
work like glucocorticoids

00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:40.830
on the immune system,
but they don't

00:42:40.830 --> 00:42:42.230
have some of the side effects.

00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:44.970
Glucocorticoids suppress
the immune system.

00:42:44.970 --> 00:42:46.870
It is very well understood.

00:42:46.870 --> 00:42:48.820
And glucocorticoids
come in and bind

00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:52.550
to the hormone binding domain
of the glucocorticoid receptor.

00:42:52.550 --> 00:42:56.070
And this translocates to a
glucocorticoid responsive

00:42:56.070 --> 00:42:56.820
promoter.

00:42:56.820 --> 00:42:58.080
That's its whole thing.

00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:02.070
So now you have gotten
a transposable event.

00:43:02.070 --> 00:43:07.030
And what you've done
instead is plunked down

00:43:07.030 --> 00:43:11.365
the hormone binding domain
from the progesterone receptor.

00:43:11.365 --> 00:43:13.950
So suddenly you've
got an if/then clause

00:43:13.950 --> 00:43:17.010
that's novel, instead of,
if they are glucocorticoids

00:43:17.010 --> 00:43:19.040
around, suppress immunity.

00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:21.680
Now instead you've got,
if there's progesterone

00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:24.210
around, suppress immunity.

00:43:24.210 --> 00:43:27.280
What do you think
you've just invented?

00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:29.570
Any uses for that?

00:43:29.570 --> 00:43:33.660
If you happen to know what
progesterone is about and where

00:43:33.660 --> 00:43:36.430
that might have been a great
invention to come up with.

00:43:36.430 --> 00:43:37.804
Any speculation?

00:43:37.804 --> 00:43:39.160
During pregnancy?

00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:40.730
During pregnancy.

00:43:40.730 --> 00:43:44.520
Progesterone, which
is progestational--

00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:48.190
so you suppress your immune
system during pregnancy.

00:43:48.190 --> 00:43:49.050
How come?

00:43:49.050 --> 00:43:51.185
Why is that a
clever thing to do?

00:43:51.185 --> 00:43:53.742
So your body doesn't
eat your baby.

00:43:53.742 --> 00:43:55.430
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:55.430 --> 00:43:58.176
Did you just say so your
body doesn't eat your baby?

00:43:58.176 --> 00:44:00.710
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:00.710 --> 00:44:03.970
Well, there you go.

00:44:03.970 --> 00:44:07.310
I don't know what your family
is like, but I won't speculate.

00:44:07.310 --> 00:44:08.450
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:08.450 --> 00:44:09.000
But, yeah.

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.460
You do that so your body
won't eat your baby.

00:44:11.460 --> 00:44:14.350
So your body doesn't do
that, so that you don't have

00:44:14.350 --> 00:44:16.410
an immune reaction against it.

00:44:16.410 --> 00:44:20.360
And that's a whole world of
having to decide this thing

00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:22.250
belongs here,
instead of this thing

00:44:22.250 --> 00:44:25.000
having invaded my
placenta-- back

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.740
to that word that was used
by gynecologists talking

00:44:27.740 --> 00:44:30.150
about last week--
the imprinted genes.

00:44:30.150 --> 00:44:33.250
Male derived imprinted genes
making for a more potent

00:44:33.250 --> 00:44:35.410
invasion into the placenta.

00:44:35.410 --> 00:44:36.510
All of that.

00:44:36.510 --> 00:44:37.160
Yeah.

00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:40.410
This is a great way to
now do that deal of,

00:44:40.410 --> 00:44:42.710
you suppress immunity
during pregnancy,

00:44:42.710 --> 00:44:45.470
you are less likely to have
some weird immune attack

00:44:45.470 --> 00:44:46.600
on your fetus.

00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:48.930
And that was a great invention.

00:44:48.930 --> 00:44:51.400
That was a wonderful thing
to have come up with.

00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:53.250
There's an interesting
consequence of that,

00:44:53.250 --> 00:44:54.930
though, one that
pops up in medicine

00:44:54.930 --> 00:44:57.440
often, which is--
so you are immune

00:44:57.440 --> 00:45:00.190
suppressed because
you're pregnant

00:45:00.190 --> 00:45:03.900
and then you give birth, and you
stop being immune suppressed.

00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:06.590
The progesterone disappears
for the most part.

00:45:06.590 --> 00:45:09.460
You're off into a very different
endocrine world at that point.

00:45:09.460 --> 00:45:13.490
Your immune system comes back
to where it was before hand.

00:45:13.490 --> 00:45:15.990
But there is a
potential problem,

00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:18.860
which is your immune
system is so wiped out

00:45:18.860 --> 00:45:22.020
and you're so distracted
changing diapers and having

00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:24.624
no sleep whatsoever, and
so your immune system is

00:45:24.624 --> 00:45:25.790
a little bit out of control.

00:45:25.790 --> 00:45:29.700
What if it recovers from this
pregnancy immune suppression

00:45:29.700 --> 00:45:32.250
and, instead of coming back
to where it was before,

00:45:32.250 --> 00:45:34.470
it overshoots a little bit?

00:45:34.470 --> 00:45:36.360
What have you gotten
at that point?

00:45:39.710 --> 00:45:42.880
Your immune system shoots
into being more active than it

00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:44.270
should be at that point.

00:45:44.270 --> 00:45:46.900
What class of diseases
are you set up for now?

00:45:46.900 --> 00:45:47.480
Autoimmune.

00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:48.420
Autoimmune disease.

00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:50.406
Whoa, that's as good
as the lock and key,

00:45:50.406 --> 00:45:51.530
everybody knowing that one.

00:45:51.530 --> 00:45:53.990
You are set up for an
autoimmune disease then.

00:45:53.990 --> 00:45:57.020
There is a whole realm
of autoimmune diseases

00:45:57.020 --> 00:45:59.140
that tend to have
either initial onset

00:45:59.140 --> 00:46:02.810
or flare up in the post
parturition period for women.

00:46:02.810 --> 00:46:04.810
And in fact, there are
some autoimmune diseases,

00:46:04.810 --> 00:46:07.060
a very serious
form, say, of lupus,

00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:09.230
women really should
not get pregnant,

00:46:09.230 --> 00:46:13.390
because they are going to get
such a burst of lupus flare ups

00:46:13.390 --> 00:46:14.170
afterward.

00:46:14.170 --> 00:46:18.290
So this is a clever thing
during pregnancy, as usual.

00:46:18.290 --> 00:46:19.710
You don't want to overdo it.

00:46:19.710 --> 00:46:22.430
Our main point here
though is, by doing

00:46:22.430 --> 00:46:26.110
some transposable event,
moving one exon around

00:46:26.110 --> 00:46:28.170
and sticking it to
another exon that never

00:46:28.170 --> 00:46:32.120
existed before, you've made
up a completely novel if/then

00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:34.060
clause.

00:46:34.060 --> 00:46:35.490
So where have we gotten so far?

00:46:35.490 --> 00:46:39.520
We are worlds away from
the dull, gradualist world

00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:43.870
of micromutational stuff from
the other day of one protein

00:46:43.870 --> 00:46:45.450
working differently.

00:46:45.450 --> 00:46:48.780
You have the capacity to invent
completely novel proteins

00:46:48.780 --> 00:46:52.790
through splicing enzyme changes,
through transposable events.

00:46:52.790 --> 00:46:56.320
You have the opportunity to
make completely novel networks

00:46:56.320 --> 00:46:59.260
with mutations and
promoters, with mutations

00:46:59.260 --> 00:47:00.710
and transcription factors.

00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:04.880
What all of this means is, there
is going to be major changes.

00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:06.790
And thus, after a
five minute break,

00:47:06.790 --> 00:47:08.350
we will come back
to your question

00:47:08.350 --> 00:47:11.420
there of, what are the odds
of these changes actually

00:47:11.420 --> 00:47:13.090
being good for you?

00:47:13.090 --> 00:47:15.470
So a five minute break.

00:47:15.470 --> 00:47:19.060
Sometimes you will find a
gene will be duplicated.

00:47:19.060 --> 00:47:21.440
There will be an extra
copy of the gene.

00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:24.400
There will be two copies,
one after the other.

00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:26.150
Gene duplication.

00:47:26.150 --> 00:47:31.060
Sometimes, you can have even a
larger expansion of the number

00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:32.320
of copies of a gene.

00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:35.710
Or you can have duplication
of a whole stretch of genes.

00:47:35.710 --> 00:47:37.900
And this is falling
into this new area

00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:42.750
that people refer to, calling
it copy number variant.

00:47:42.750 --> 00:47:46.640
And ranging from one
extra copy of one gene

00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:50.600
to massive duplication of
whole stretches of chromosomes.

00:47:50.600 --> 00:47:53.260
And no surprise,
you wind up getting

00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:55.990
interestingly different
things going on at that point.

00:47:55.990 --> 00:47:58.070
What we'll see later
on in the course is,

00:47:58.070 --> 00:48:01.460
there is more and more evidence
that the disease schizophrenia

00:48:01.460 --> 00:48:05.010
involves mutations in
copy number variance.

00:48:05.010 --> 00:48:08.660
And here, this is not a
mutation in one base pair.

00:48:08.660 --> 00:48:11.110
This is not a mutation
in one transcription.

00:48:11.110 --> 00:48:14.400
This is extra copies
of genes sitting there.

00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:17.730
This can have some very
interesting implications.

00:48:17.730 --> 00:48:21.460
In some cases, the second
gene can function as a backup.

00:48:21.460 --> 00:48:23.700
If something goes
wrong in the first one,

00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:25.580
there's a second one
there doing its job.

00:48:25.580 --> 00:48:28.390
And there is some suggestion
that something like that

00:48:28.390 --> 00:48:32.520
is occurring in some subsets
of Alzheimer's disease.

00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:36.740
Or what you can have is the
number of copies of the gene

00:48:36.740 --> 00:48:39.680
you make has something to do
with how much of the protein

00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:40.470
you make.

00:48:40.470 --> 00:48:42.510
And there's recent
studies showing

00:48:42.510 --> 00:48:45.640
that when you compare
Japanese populations

00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:48.520
with Western European
ones, on the average,

00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:52.030
Japanese populations have
more copies of a gene that

00:48:52.030 --> 00:48:54.570
has multiple copies, more
copies of a gene that

00:48:54.570 --> 00:48:58.140
makes an enzyme related
to carbohydrate digestion.

00:48:58.140 --> 00:49:00.810
I have no idea what the
implications would be of that.

00:49:00.810 --> 00:49:05.330
But this is not a populational
difference in a DNA sequence

00:49:05.330 --> 00:49:09.260
or in a-- this is simply the
number of copies of the gene.

00:49:09.260 --> 00:49:12.150
What a second copy,
what a duplication also

00:49:12.150 --> 00:49:15.040
allows you to do in the
most metaphorical sense

00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:17.970
is experiment with
one of the copies.

00:49:17.970 --> 00:49:19.530
Because the other
one is there taking

00:49:19.530 --> 00:49:21.830
care of whatever the
function is that's critical,

00:49:21.830 --> 00:49:26.370
what you'll see is you get
faster evolution going on

00:49:26.370 --> 00:49:29.510
with genes that you have
duplicated, where one of them

00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:32.020
is the one that, in
a sense, is freed

00:49:32.020 --> 00:49:33.670
to have more dramatic movement.

00:49:33.670 --> 00:49:35.820
And what you then
see is it's more

00:49:35.820 --> 00:49:39.330
likely to stumble
into some great use

00:49:39.330 --> 00:49:42.580
without sacrificing the
initial use in the process.

00:49:42.580 --> 00:49:44.050
And there's a guy
at the University

00:49:44.050 --> 00:49:45.680
of Oregon named
Joe Thornton who's

00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:49.660
done really interesting work
on the evolution of genes

00:49:49.660 --> 00:49:51.600
for steroid receptors.

00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:54.020
And what he has shown
from ancestral genes

00:49:54.020 --> 00:49:56.380
is that's exactly
what's occurred.

00:49:56.380 --> 00:49:59.720
A lot of what are now two
different genes for two

00:49:59.720 --> 00:50:02.380
different types of
steroids receptors

00:50:02.380 --> 00:50:05.030
were once duplicates
of the same gene.

00:50:05.030 --> 00:50:08.250
And one was allowed to
float and eventually,

00:50:08.250 --> 00:50:11.100
in at least some cases,
stumbled into something useful,

00:50:11.100 --> 00:50:13.880
while the other one
held into place.

00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:16.800
In passing, what
that phenomenon does

00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:20.670
is help explain one of
the endless, frustrating,

00:50:20.670 --> 00:50:24.110
exasperating, irritating
things that people

00:50:24.110 --> 00:50:26.750
who attack the notion
of evolution bring up,

00:50:26.750 --> 00:50:33.550
which is the famed sound bite
that they have of the problem

00:50:33.550 --> 00:50:35.510
irreducible complexity.

00:50:35.510 --> 00:50:37.010
It always runs the
same way, which

00:50:37.010 --> 00:50:38.920
is saying that
evolution can't possibly

00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:43.620
exist because is what
good is half of an eye?

00:50:43.620 --> 00:50:45.510
You've got to have those
intermediate forms.

00:50:45.510 --> 00:50:47.980
And what good is it-- you
couldn't have invented.

00:50:47.980 --> 00:50:49.960
Evolution could not
have produced an eye

00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:52.967
in one mutation, one
generation, and thus it

00:50:52.967 --> 00:50:54.550
would have to be in
a series of steps.

00:50:54.550 --> 00:50:56.360
And what good are
the series of steps?

00:50:56.360 --> 00:50:57.110
They can't exist.

00:50:57.110 --> 00:51:00.260
There can't be anything
such as evolution.

00:51:00.260 --> 00:51:00.890
Off you go.

00:51:00.890 --> 00:51:01.840
Hallelujah.

00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:04.540
So what you get
here in these cases

00:51:04.540 --> 00:51:07.400
is a demonstration,
instead, by having

00:51:07.400 --> 00:51:12.440
extra copies of genes, one of
which is freed to be evolving.

00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:15.640
You don't have to have a
rapid transition from one

00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:16.510
to the other.

00:51:16.510 --> 00:51:19.690
You can have this thing
moving along, stumbling along,

00:51:19.690 --> 00:51:24.970
until it just happens to come up
with a shape of a receptor that

00:51:24.970 --> 00:51:29.070
just happens to be able to
bind a hormone that stumbled

00:51:29.070 --> 00:51:32.740
its own way into existence
10,000 generations earlier,

00:51:32.740 --> 00:51:35.940
which because it was duplicated,
it didn't matter that one

00:51:35.940 --> 00:51:39.800
copy was now of a form where
there was no receptor on earth

00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:43.020
for it until it happened
to stumble into that.

00:51:43.020 --> 00:51:44.650
And there is more
and more evidence

00:51:44.650 --> 00:51:48.360
that duplicated genes
have a way of describing

00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:51.990
these intermediate states
where you don't necessarily

00:51:51.990 --> 00:51:54.390
have half an eye,
but instead you

00:51:54.390 --> 00:51:56.520
have the pieces
ready in place there

00:51:56.520 --> 00:51:58.690
for when one thing
suddenly pops up,

00:51:58.690 --> 00:52:00.270
which completes the picture.

00:52:00.270 --> 00:52:03.210
In fact, you can have, as
it turns out, sort of half.

00:52:03.210 --> 00:52:05.430
Russ Fernald in the
biology department

00:52:05.430 --> 00:52:08.520
has done really cool research
on the evolution of eyes.

00:52:08.520 --> 00:52:10.690
And you should read
about it some time

00:52:10.690 --> 00:52:13.280
to read basically
how eyes evolved

00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:15.980
from a single layer of
cells on the surface

00:52:15.980 --> 00:52:18.440
of some ancient proto something.

00:52:18.440 --> 00:52:20.880
And you sure can
have half an eye

00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:22.720
and a zillion
intermediate forms.

00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:25.890
None the less, this
business of multiple copies

00:52:25.890 --> 00:52:30.650
allowing you the freedom to have
loser evolving of single genes

00:52:30.650 --> 00:52:33.970
of a time-- critical mechanism.

00:52:33.970 --> 00:52:37.310
So now we've got all of our
pieces in place-- changes

00:52:37.310 --> 00:52:40.640
in splicing enzymes and
promoters and transcription

00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:42.910
factors and transportable
elements and number

00:52:42.910 --> 00:52:45.290
of copies of genes,
number of copies

00:52:45.290 --> 00:52:46.800
of whole stretches of genes.

00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:49.550
What wind up being the
consequences of this?

00:52:49.550 --> 00:52:52.200
Back to the question
brought up before.

00:52:52.200 --> 00:52:56.180
So what we saw the other day is
some time futz around with one

00:52:56.180 --> 00:52:58.802
single base pair,
one single gene,

00:52:58.802 --> 00:53:00.510
and you've got somebody
who's going to be

00:53:00.510 --> 00:53:02.260
dead at three months of age.

00:53:02.260 --> 00:53:04.570
PKU, phenylketonuria.

00:53:04.570 --> 00:53:08.120
One single gene could be
a total, utter disaster.

00:53:08.120 --> 00:53:09.230
My god.

00:53:09.230 --> 00:53:13.410
Instead now, thanks to these
macro evolutionary changes,

00:53:13.410 --> 00:53:16.650
you change one single
base pair and as a result

00:53:16.650 --> 00:53:20.590
you change-- one, two,
three-- seven different genes.

00:53:20.590 --> 00:53:21.460
No, not seven.

00:53:21.460 --> 00:53:23.720
But you change
more than one gene,

00:53:23.720 --> 00:53:26.400
you have one single
base pair change,

00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:28.320
and if it's an exon
that's used in a lot

00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:30.200
of different
combinatorial ways, you've

00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:32.920
now produced mutated
versions of a whole bunch

00:53:32.920 --> 00:53:33.860
of different proteins.

00:53:33.860 --> 00:53:37.460
One single change in the
transcription factor and you've

00:53:37.460 --> 00:53:41.040
invented an entirely new
network of expression.

00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:44.340
What are the odds of
stumbling into something there

00:53:44.340 --> 00:53:48.410
that is going to suddenly be
great and wonderful in all

00:53:48.410 --> 00:53:50.130
those different
areas of consequence?

00:53:50.130 --> 00:53:52.350
It's really unlikely.

00:53:52.350 --> 00:53:54.560
What have we just seen here?

00:53:54.560 --> 00:54:00.280
This is a very stabilizing
mechanism for equilibrium.

00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:03.050
Equilibrium, long
periods of stasis.

00:54:03.050 --> 00:54:06.040
What we've got is,
if a single base pair

00:54:06.040 --> 00:54:10.000
change is going to affect half
a dozen different proteins

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:12.210
or affect, through a
transcription factor,

00:54:12.210 --> 00:54:16.200
entire networks, the odds are
pretty lousy that you are just

00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:18.730
going to happen to
stumble into one that

00:54:18.730 --> 00:54:20.960
works in all those
domains, or at least

00:54:20.960 --> 00:54:24.130
works in enough of them that
it doesn't do you in in others.

00:54:24.130 --> 00:54:26.950
Most of these macro
mutational changes

00:54:26.950 --> 00:54:28.990
are going to be bad news.

00:54:28.990 --> 00:54:31.130
Most of the time,
in other words,

00:54:31.130 --> 00:54:34.400
there is stabilizing
selection against

00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:36.320
macro mutational changes.

00:54:36.320 --> 00:54:37.930
So what have we just gotten?

00:54:37.930 --> 00:54:41.240
We've just gotten
a straight line.

00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:44.010
We've just gotten long
periods of stasis.

00:54:44.010 --> 00:54:46.300
So when do the changes come?

00:54:46.300 --> 00:54:49.510
When you have some circumstance
that is extreme enough

00:54:49.510 --> 00:54:52.400
that it doesn't matter
that if this mutation--

00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:55.700
you have made elevendy
new types of proteins.

00:54:55.700 --> 00:54:59.340
And elevendy minus one of
them are not great news.

00:54:59.340 --> 00:55:01.090
And the final one
used to kill you.

00:55:01.090 --> 00:55:03.360
If the final one now
is the trait that

00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:05.570
is going to save
you, it is going

00:55:05.570 --> 00:55:08.730
to carry the weight of all
the other proteins that

00:55:08.730 --> 00:55:09.620
are changed.

00:55:09.620 --> 00:55:13.550
If you get what is called
an evolutionary bottleneck,

00:55:13.550 --> 00:55:19.040
if you get a circumstance of
such severe selection for such

00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:23.307
a tiny subset of traits,
that basically the rule is

00:55:23.307 --> 00:55:25.890
it doesn't matter-- if you have
that trait-- it doesn't matter

00:55:25.890 --> 00:55:27.825
how much of a network
you've changed,

00:55:27.825 --> 00:55:29.950
you're going to be one of
the ones who come through

00:55:29.950 --> 00:55:32.210
and everybody else does not.

00:55:32.210 --> 00:55:34.760
And the evolutionary
record is full of all sorts

00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:38.080
of circumstances where there
have been selective bottlenecks

00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:42.800
where 1% of a population comes
out the other end of it because

00:55:42.800 --> 00:55:46.810
of some rare trait that they
had which carries all the macro

00:55:46.810 --> 00:55:48.170
consequences of that.

00:55:48.170 --> 00:55:50.530
For example, there
was clearly some sort

00:55:50.530 --> 00:55:54.241
of bottleneck of selection that
went on with cheetahs about--

00:55:54.241 --> 00:55:56.240
I don't know, a couple
thousand years ago or so.

00:55:56.240 --> 00:55:58.620
People have estimated
more accurately.

00:55:58.620 --> 00:56:01.720
Because all the cheetahs
are so genetically

00:56:01.720 --> 00:56:05.390
similar to each other that
you can transplant tissue,

00:56:05.390 --> 00:56:08.470
you can graft tissue
from any cheetah on earth

00:56:08.470 --> 00:56:11.440
onto another one and there
will not be rejection.

00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:15.370
All of the cheetah on earth
are closely related descendants

00:56:15.370 --> 00:56:19.670
of what had to have been fairly
recently, a couple of thousand,

00:56:19.670 --> 00:56:24.480
a tidy, remnant population
that now is highly inbred

00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:27.710
and you had some sort
of selective bottleneck

00:56:27.710 --> 00:56:29.840
that went on at that time.

00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:32.940
Similarly, I can't remember
when in hominid history,

00:56:32.940 --> 00:56:35.730
but the suggestion was at
at least a couple of points

00:56:35.730 --> 00:56:37.700
in hominid evolution,
there have been

00:56:37.700 --> 00:56:43.960
points of selective bottlenecks
where glaciers or comets

00:56:43.960 --> 00:56:48.270
or knows what, where only a
small subset of individuals

00:56:48.270 --> 00:56:52.560
with some traits that have
been, up until then, neutral

00:56:52.560 --> 00:56:55.140
or are unlikely to be useful
because of these big macro

00:56:55.140 --> 00:56:58.310
consequences, suddenly
only the folks who had it

00:56:58.310 --> 00:56:59.810
came out the other end.

00:56:59.810 --> 00:57:02.030
What are we beginning
to describe here?

00:57:02.030 --> 00:57:05.360
Circumstances of rapid change.

00:57:05.360 --> 00:57:08.760
Circumstances of
punctuated radical change.

00:57:08.760 --> 00:57:11.300
There are circumstances
that begin

00:57:11.300 --> 00:57:14.790
to make conceivable
punctuated equilibrium.

00:57:14.790 --> 00:57:18.370
It's so intrinsic in
this huge complexity

00:57:18.370 --> 00:57:23.290
of macroevolutionary change in
DNA because of the structure

00:57:23.290 --> 00:57:26.230
intrinsic in it are
two critical things.

00:57:26.230 --> 00:57:28.750
One is the vast
majority of the time,

00:57:28.750 --> 00:57:31.810
make a change which
changes some whole network

00:57:31.810 --> 00:57:33.780
and it's going,
to be a disaster.

00:57:33.780 --> 00:57:36.760
The majority of the time,
there's going to be stasis.

00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:40.120
And also intrinsic in
that is the ability

00:57:40.120 --> 00:57:44.090
to have massive macro
changes, any of these examples

00:57:44.090 --> 00:57:45.970
we've had here,
where, in periods

00:57:45.970 --> 00:57:49.340
of selective bottlenecks,
you're going to get something

00:57:49.340 --> 00:57:51.390
like that happening.

00:57:51.390 --> 00:57:54.540
So Gould and friends
are absolutely right.

00:57:54.540 --> 00:57:55.640
All of that.

00:57:55.640 --> 00:57:56.940
Not necessarily.

00:57:56.940 --> 00:58:01.480
Because again, this radical
rapid change period, that's

00:58:01.480 --> 00:58:03.850
for paleontologists,
for biologists.

00:58:03.850 --> 00:58:06.990
That's thousands of
generations, in some cases.

00:58:06.990 --> 00:58:09.470
Again, what counts
as very rapid in one

00:58:09.470 --> 00:58:12.690
scientific discipline may not
be the same for the biologist

00:58:12.690 --> 00:58:13.530
at the other end.

00:58:13.530 --> 00:58:16.060
Nonetheless, this winds
up being a mechanism

00:58:16.060 --> 00:58:22.070
for long periods of spaces
and very rapid change.

00:58:22.070 --> 00:58:24.940
So that suggests that, where
we have these mechanisms.

00:58:24.940 --> 00:58:29.210
So how does one begin to resolve
the microevolutionary picture

00:58:29.210 --> 00:58:32.010
of gradualist social
biology from last week

00:58:32.010 --> 00:58:35.110
and the macro picture of
punctuated equilibrium

00:58:35.110 --> 00:58:36.340
drama, all of that?

00:58:36.340 --> 00:58:39.000
How do you begin to put
the pieces together?

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:40.820
A number of ways that
it could be done.

00:58:40.820 --> 00:58:43.550
Let me just see here.

00:58:43.550 --> 00:58:44.140
Yes.

00:58:44.140 --> 00:58:46.150
A number of ways
it could be done.

00:58:46.150 --> 00:58:50.210
One is thinking again about
micro mutational changes

00:58:50.210 --> 00:58:54.130
or about changes in the function
of preexisting proteins.

00:58:54.130 --> 00:58:57.260
And macro mutational changes
are about the invention

00:58:57.260 --> 00:59:01.160
of new proteins, new networks,
new, if/then clauses,

00:59:01.160 --> 00:59:04.010
all of that serving
different functions.

00:59:04.010 --> 00:59:05.870
Back to the difference
in the genome

00:59:05.870 --> 00:59:07.700
between humans and chimps.

00:59:07.700 --> 00:59:11.420
When you look at the micro
versus the macro differences,

00:59:11.420 --> 00:59:15.000
for example, in the domain
of the immune system,

00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:17.370
most of the differences
between humans and chimps

00:59:17.370 --> 00:59:21.450
genetically have to do with
microevolutionary differences.

00:59:21.450 --> 00:59:23.740
And that comes down
to clinical pictures

00:59:23.740 --> 00:59:27.850
that you see humans are much
more resistant to tuberculosis

00:59:27.850 --> 00:59:29.620
than chimps are.

00:59:29.620 --> 00:59:33.780
Chimps are much more resistant
to malaria than humans are.

00:59:33.780 --> 00:59:37.240
Nonetheless, it's the basic nuts
and bolts of the immune system

00:59:37.240 --> 00:59:37.850
there.

00:59:37.850 --> 00:59:40.200
One of these guys has a
little bit better of this,

00:59:40.200 --> 00:59:41.560
one has worse of that.

00:59:41.560 --> 00:59:44.290
This is within a realm
of gradualist change.

00:59:44.290 --> 00:59:46.740
The genetic differences
that explain that

00:59:46.740 --> 00:59:48.680
are microevolutionary ones.

00:59:48.680 --> 00:59:52.090
Where are the macro evolutionary
differences between humans

00:59:52.090 --> 00:59:53.420
and chimp genomes?

00:59:53.420 --> 00:59:56.610
Those are the ones that
have to do with development.

00:59:56.610 --> 01:00:00.540
And those are the ones that
amplify differences big time.

01:00:00.540 --> 01:00:02.800
You have one tiny little
difference and you

01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:06.550
get an organism that's going to
look as different from a chimp

01:00:06.550 --> 01:00:07.430
as a human does.

01:00:07.430 --> 01:00:10.750
The other way around, some
systems, their evolution

01:00:10.750 --> 01:00:14.170
is much more built driven by
micro changes, some much more

01:00:14.170 --> 01:00:14.780
than macro.

01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:17.220
Some of the most
interesting macro stuff

01:00:17.220 --> 01:00:19.760
is going to be
developmental blueprints,

01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:22.470
developmental trajectories.

01:00:22.470 --> 01:00:23.210
What else?

01:00:23.210 --> 01:00:25.160
What else in terms
of resolution?

01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:27.740
There are plenty
of fossil histories

01:00:27.740 --> 01:00:30.910
by now for some line that are
complete enough that it is

01:00:30.910 --> 01:00:33.570
very clear they look like this.

01:00:33.570 --> 01:00:35.900
And the majority
of fossil pedigrees

01:00:35.900 --> 01:00:40.140
that are that detailed enough
support a punctuated model.

01:00:40.140 --> 01:00:41.940
Nonetheless, there
are plenty that

01:00:41.940 --> 01:00:45.210
are understood with as many
time points in here that

01:00:45.210 --> 01:00:46.980
follow gradualist models.

01:00:46.980 --> 01:00:49.020
So evidence for both.

01:00:49.020 --> 01:00:52.320
Nonetheless mostly
punctuated evidence.

01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:55.220
The biggest problem though
in debating all of this

01:00:55.220 --> 01:00:57.940
is it is impossible
for the most part

01:00:57.940 --> 01:01:02.780
to see gradualism going
on, because it's gradual,

01:01:02.780 --> 01:01:05.120
because it's hard to spot that.

01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:08.390
It's hard to show whether
changes are incremental

01:01:08.390 --> 01:01:09.970
or changes are rapid.

01:01:09.970 --> 01:01:12.770
But by now, there
are a few examples

01:01:12.770 --> 01:01:15.790
where people have actually
been able to observe

01:01:15.790 --> 01:01:18.720
evolutionary changes
in organisms and ones

01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:21.050
that can count as fairly rapid.

01:01:21.050 --> 01:01:25.270
One first example-- for reasons
I cannot begin to understand,

01:01:25.270 --> 01:01:28.880
people in Chicago-- I don't know
if it's in the Chicago Field

01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:31.400
Museum or the mayor's
office or something--

01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:34.370
have all sorts of carcasses
around from rats killed

01:01:34.370 --> 01:01:37.670
in Chicago in the 1880s.

01:01:37.670 --> 01:01:40.330
Key to the city,
souvenirs, who knows what?

01:01:40.330 --> 01:01:41.570
Chicago's centennial.

01:01:41.570 --> 01:01:43.320
But those around
stored someplace.

01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:45.070
And a few years ago,
researchers were

01:01:45.070 --> 01:01:47.960
able to look at the
genomes of those beasts

01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:50.490
compared to rats
that are being taken

01:01:50.490 --> 01:01:53.340
these days off the streets
of Chicago, current ones,

01:01:53.340 --> 01:01:57.470
and showing over the course of
a century, a lot of the genome

01:01:57.470 --> 01:01:58.330
has evolved.

01:01:58.330 --> 01:02:00.390
There are a lot of differences.

01:02:00.390 --> 01:02:04.185
Over the course of a century--
I don't know, what is that?

01:02:04.185 --> 01:02:07.160
Maybe 500, 1,000
generations or so.

01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:10.170
There has been significant
change over that time.

01:02:10.170 --> 01:02:12.570
Darwin's finches,
for those of you

01:02:12.570 --> 01:02:15.810
Darwin history fans, that
started the whole thing.

01:02:15.810 --> 01:02:17.300
All sorts of different species.

01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:19.400
The finches found in
the Galapagos Islands

01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:21.520
and people have
been studying them

01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:24.220
for half a century,
three-quarters of a century.

01:02:24.220 --> 01:02:27.960
Gene distributions are
changing-- gene distributions

01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:30.570
for traits, like the
size of your bill

01:02:30.570 --> 01:02:33.470
and thus what kind of
food you could break into,

01:02:33.470 --> 01:02:36.120
in response to environmental
shifting there.

01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:37.700
That is being documented.

01:02:37.700 --> 01:02:39.300
That's going on.

01:02:39.300 --> 01:02:40.220
What else?

01:02:40.220 --> 01:02:43.130
Another one that is
really interesting

01:02:43.130 --> 01:02:45.340
and important and
critical for lots

01:02:45.340 --> 01:02:50.400
of us, which is the evolution
of resistance to diabetes.

01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:52.580
This is a very
interesting phenomenon.

01:02:52.580 --> 01:02:54.330
Diabetes comes in two forms.

01:02:54.330 --> 01:02:57.650
Juvenile onset diabetes-- that's
the one where you need insulin.

01:02:57.650 --> 01:03:00.180
The diabetes that's instead
becoming an epidemic

01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:03.150
is adult onset
diabetes, which is

01:03:03.150 --> 01:03:06.890
when you have a body
which is all built out

01:03:06.890 --> 01:03:10.860
of lean hominid history to
store away lots of calories

01:03:10.860 --> 01:03:13.880
and all of that, and you
throw in a westernized diet

01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:17.500
and you get the increasing
westernized problem of obesity.

01:03:17.500 --> 01:03:20.375
And you then wind
up getting diabetes.

01:03:20.375 --> 01:03:22.250
For our purposes right
now, it doesn't matter

01:03:22.250 --> 01:03:23.650
what diabetes looks like.

01:03:23.650 --> 01:03:26.360
The main thing is,
it is driven by food

01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:29.370
excesses in westernized diets.

01:03:29.370 --> 01:03:30.880
So there's been a
whole literature

01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:33.900
by now of people
studying populations

01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:38.020
that have had rapid shifts
from traditional diets

01:03:38.020 --> 01:03:39.560
to westernized diets.

01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:42.460
A lot of Pacific Islanders
have been studied.

01:03:42.460 --> 01:03:44.210
All sorts of other populations.

01:03:44.210 --> 01:03:47.270
The group that is the
iconic one to study

01:03:47.270 --> 01:03:49.910
is Native American
group in Arizona

01:03:49.910 --> 01:03:51.770
called the Pima Indians.

01:03:51.770 --> 01:03:54.600
And what's very convenient
about them is about half

01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:56.930
of them live in the United
States and about half

01:03:56.930 --> 01:03:57.800
in Mexico.

01:03:57.800 --> 01:04:01.100
And there has been very
rapid changes in diet

01:04:01.100 --> 01:04:04.240
in the American side, less so
in the Mexican one-- far more

01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:04.890
traditional.

01:04:04.890 --> 01:04:07.340
And one of the things
that soon emerged

01:04:07.340 --> 01:04:10.440
once westernized sort of
typical processed food

01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:13.960
became the predominant food
eaten by people in the Arizona

01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:20.380
side is 90% diabetes rates by
the time you're 30 years old.

01:04:20.380 --> 01:04:23.210
The exact same thing in
some of the Pacific Islands

01:04:23.210 --> 01:04:26.630
that have been studied,
in the Naru and Samoa

01:04:26.630 --> 01:04:28.190
and some of these other places.

01:04:28.190 --> 01:04:30.950
Astronomically high
rates of diabetes.

01:04:30.950 --> 01:04:33.110
Another population
where it's been studied

01:04:33.110 --> 01:04:36.510
are populations of Jews
who were living in Yemen

01:04:36.510 --> 01:04:39.210
and who-- I think in
the '60s or '70s--

01:04:39.210 --> 01:04:42.520
moved to Israel, switching
from a very traditional diet

01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:44.240
to a very westernized one.

01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:46.990
Diabetes rates absolutely
through the roof.

01:04:46.990 --> 01:04:50.480
What that's doing very
quickly was killing off

01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:54.400
all sorts of folks very early in
their reproductive life history

01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:55.160
periods.

01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:56.730
Suddenly you've
got the people who

01:04:56.730 --> 01:05:00.490
are most vulnerable to
diabetes when suddenly given

01:05:00.490 --> 01:05:02.300
a westernized diet,
they're leaving

01:05:02.300 --> 01:05:04.350
fewer copies of their genes.

01:05:04.350 --> 01:05:06.570
And it's been in the
last decade or so,

01:05:06.570 --> 01:05:08.730
some of the Pacific
island populations

01:05:08.730 --> 01:05:11.430
that have been studied,
the diabetes rates

01:05:11.430 --> 01:05:13.620
are beginning to go down.

01:05:13.620 --> 01:05:16.190
In other words, there has
been this selection that

01:05:16.190 --> 01:05:18.230
went into Western
European populations,

01:05:18.230 --> 01:05:21.310
I don't know, a
century or so, which

01:05:21.310 --> 01:05:24.520
is the folks who have the
most efficient metabolisms

01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:28.750
and can store away all of
those dozens of Hershey bars

01:05:28.750 --> 01:05:29.820
effortlessly.

01:05:29.820 --> 01:05:30.930
They're dead.

01:05:30.930 --> 01:05:33.460
And they died before they
left copies of their genes.

01:05:33.460 --> 01:05:36.600
You are now selecting
for human populations

01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:38.880
that have sloppier metabolisms.

01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:42.440
And this is within the
course of a century.

01:05:42.440 --> 01:05:43.430
Another example.

01:05:43.430 --> 01:05:46.720
Here's a totally, totally
cool, irresistible one.

01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:50.368
This is one of the
great genetics stories.

01:05:57.600 --> 01:06:04.200
As you can see, or not,
this pure white screen

01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:07.691
tells you that this is research
that went on in Siberia.

01:06:07.691 --> 01:06:08.540
[LAUGHTER]

01:06:08.540 --> 01:06:13.420
Actually, these were Siberian--
so this was a famous study done

01:06:13.420 --> 01:06:16.800
by this Soviet
geneticists starting,

01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:18.480
I don't know, about
50 years or so,

01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:21.390
where you have these
Siberian silver foxes.

01:06:21.390 --> 01:06:22.790
And that's what they look like.

01:06:22.790 --> 01:06:25.710
And for all sorts of
reasons, who knows what,

01:06:25.710 --> 01:06:28.350
it is highly valued
to have clothing made

01:06:28.350 --> 01:06:33.249
out of their bodies, and thus
highly valuable wild animals,

01:06:33.249 --> 01:06:33.790
tough to get.

01:06:33.790 --> 01:06:36.550
And this guy decided,
well, what we need to do

01:06:36.550 --> 01:06:40.650
is start some Siberian silver
fox domestication farming

01:06:40.650 --> 01:06:41.320
stuff.

01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:43.710
So he did a very logical thing.

01:06:43.710 --> 01:06:48.650
He started selectively
breeding them for tameness.

01:06:48.650 --> 01:06:52.260
He would have a bunch of captive
foxes that were wild born

01:06:52.260 --> 01:06:55.120
and most of them totally
feral and crazed.

01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:59.520
And he would see, is there
a subset, 5%, 10% of them,

01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:03.100
that I could get relatively
closer to that were calmer

01:07:03.100 --> 01:07:05.030
in the human's proximity?

01:07:05.030 --> 01:07:07.180
Only let those ones breed.

01:07:07.180 --> 01:07:11.100
Now take their offspring
and only take the 10% or so

01:07:11.100 --> 01:07:14.340
that are most calm,
most easily tamed.

01:07:14.340 --> 01:07:19.160
And it took about 35
generations or so to get foxes

01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:22.920
that were as tame as dogs are.

01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:25.910
Something else totally amazing.

01:07:25.910 --> 01:07:30.830
So he's breeding them for only
one trait-- a behavioral trait,

01:07:30.830 --> 01:07:34.000
which is the ability
to get close to them

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:37.140
if you're a human,
calmness on their part,

01:07:37.140 --> 01:07:38.930
whatever you might
describe it as.

01:07:38.930 --> 01:07:42.660
Breeding entirely
based on that trait.

01:07:42.660 --> 01:07:45.860
And when you spend 35
generations breeding

01:07:45.860 --> 01:07:48.720
a wild animal like
a fox so that it's

01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:51.700
the ones who are
most able to function

01:07:51.700 --> 01:07:54.050
in the role of
domesticated animals,

01:07:54.050 --> 01:07:56.560
it's not just the
behavior that changes.

01:07:56.560 --> 01:08:00.996
This is what the adults look
like 35 generations later.

01:08:00.996 --> 01:08:02.394
Aw!

01:08:02.394 --> 01:08:03.326
[LAUGHTER]

01:08:03.326 --> 01:08:06.020
Oh, give me one.

01:08:06.020 --> 01:08:06.810
Give me 100.

01:08:06.810 --> 01:08:09.920
I want-- yes.

01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:11.070
They're adorable.

01:08:11.070 --> 01:08:13.110
Can you believe how
great they look?

01:08:13.110 --> 01:08:14.960
What's going on here?

01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:17.569
They were selecting
for a behavioral trait,

01:08:17.569 --> 01:08:19.840
and they are fox puppies.

01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:22.700
They've got a big roundy
ears and these cute

01:08:22.700 --> 01:08:24.729
little short muzzle things.

01:08:24.729 --> 01:08:28.135
And they wag their tails
when humans show up.

01:08:28.135 --> 01:08:30.520
And these are not dog
descent into wolves.

01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:34.310
This was 35 generations to
turn something on to left

01:08:34.310 --> 01:08:36.060
into something
looking at the right.

01:08:36.060 --> 01:08:38.960
Very interesting thing we
will come to in the ethology

01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:39.710
lectures.

01:08:39.710 --> 01:08:42.170
Basically, what you're
breeding for when you're

01:08:42.170 --> 01:08:44.770
breeding a wild animal
to be tame-able,

01:08:44.770 --> 01:08:46.670
your breeding for
the ones that behave

01:08:46.670 --> 01:08:49.890
more childishly, the
ones who are acting more

01:08:49.890 --> 01:08:52.340
like developing
animals who are more

01:08:52.340 --> 01:08:54.270
dependent on other individuals.

01:08:54.270 --> 01:08:57.279
You're breeding them
for infantile traits.

01:08:57.279 --> 01:08:59.979
This is what a baby
fox looks like.

01:08:59.979 --> 01:09:03.270
This is what these
domesticated foxes look like.

01:09:03.270 --> 01:09:06.270
Totally amazing
that this happened.

01:09:06.270 --> 01:09:07.979
Ironic ending
department-- you will

01:09:07.979 --> 01:09:11.990
notice that the coat has changed
from the ones on the left

01:09:11.990 --> 01:09:14.529
to these wonderful
coats that you just

01:09:14.529 --> 01:09:17.779
want to have made into
underwear and hats and all

01:09:17.779 --> 01:09:19.069
of that sort of thing.

01:09:19.069 --> 01:09:23.350
And on the right, they
look like Spot and Rover

01:09:23.350 --> 01:09:24.819
and all those guys.

01:09:24.819 --> 01:09:28.069
It is called a piebald
coloration pattern.

01:09:28.069 --> 01:09:31.029
Somehow also, you can't
get the domestication

01:09:31.029 --> 01:09:32.270
without that happening.

01:09:32.270 --> 01:09:34.279
Ironic ending--
nobody wants to wear

01:09:34.279 --> 01:09:35.920
clothes that look like that.

01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:38.000
They would've been killing
Dalmatians for years

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:39.370
if that were desirable.

01:09:39.370 --> 01:09:41.410
In the process of
breeding them, they

01:09:41.410 --> 01:09:43.250
became useless economically.

01:09:43.250 --> 01:09:48.240
Nonetheless, totally
amazing demonstration.

01:09:48.240 --> 01:09:51.000
35 generations and
you turn something

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:52.580
on to left into
something looking

01:09:52.580 --> 01:09:55.270
like that on the right, who
will wag its tail like you would

01:09:55.270 --> 01:09:58.760
lick your face and bring your
chewed up slippers back to you.

01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:01.500
This is a very rapid change.

01:10:01.500 --> 01:10:02.870
Final example.

01:10:02.870 --> 01:10:07.040
This is one that is also
quite consequential,

01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:09.730
and one possibly even
more so than diabetes,

01:10:09.730 --> 01:10:11.880
which is if this
type of evolution

01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:15.050
keeps occurring at the rate
that it's happening, all of us

01:10:15.050 --> 01:10:17.440
are going to have
dramatically shortened life

01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:22.330
expectancies-- antibiotic
resistance in various bacteria.

01:10:22.330 --> 01:10:24.040
Evolution going on there.

01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:26.620
What we see in all
sorts of cases is,

01:10:26.620 --> 01:10:29.550
evolution is not just
occurring over the course

01:10:29.550 --> 01:10:32.000
of glacial lengths of time.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.530
It can be occurring
very rapidly.

01:10:34.530 --> 01:10:37.620
And what we see here
also is, in some cases,

01:10:37.620 --> 01:10:40.190
it's going to leave a
different sort of skeleton,

01:10:40.190 --> 01:10:43.830
changing how good your kidneys
and pancreases are dealing

01:10:43.830 --> 01:10:46.140
with westernized
food, that's not going

01:10:46.140 --> 01:10:47.800
to make for a different fossil.

01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:50.221
Breeding for antibiotic
resistance in bacteria

01:10:50.221 --> 01:10:52.220
is not going to make for
a different-- actually,

01:10:52.220 --> 01:10:55.080
can bacteria even make fossils?

01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:55.865
Does anybody know?

01:10:55.865 --> 01:10:56.365
Yes.

01:10:56.365 --> 01:10:57.210
Yes.

01:10:57.210 --> 01:11:00.110
So it's going to make bacterial
fossils that look exactly--

01:11:00.110 --> 01:11:03.570
all of this interesting
amazing stuff going on,

01:11:03.570 --> 01:11:08.490
and it's stuff that no
punctuated radical dogmatic

01:11:08.490 --> 01:11:12.310
paleontology type would
ever be able to pick up.

01:11:12.310 --> 01:11:13.930
So what are we heading to here?

01:11:13.930 --> 01:11:18.110
We're heading to a wonderful
heart-warming resolution

01:11:18.110 --> 01:11:20.940
of these different
schools of thought, which

01:11:20.940 --> 01:11:23.250
is, can't we all get along?

01:11:23.250 --> 01:11:25.400
And can't we all
have means of having

01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:29.010
different types of
evolution happening?

01:11:29.010 --> 01:11:32.780
So almost certainly harking
back to what mentioned before,

01:11:32.780 --> 01:11:36.040
microevolutionary
changes-- the immune system

01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:37.420
in chimps versus humans.

01:11:37.420 --> 01:11:39.780
Macroevolutionary
changes development.

01:11:39.780 --> 01:11:42.540
You don't have to choose
vanilla or chocolate.

01:11:42.540 --> 01:11:44.660
They could be going
on at the same time.

01:11:44.660 --> 01:11:46.540
And they could be going
on at the same time

01:11:46.540 --> 01:11:50.280
in a very important
resolving way, which

01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:55.180
is-- so you've got evidence
for a punctuated change

01:11:55.180 --> 01:11:56.360
of some trait.

01:11:56.360 --> 01:11:59.780
And single traits
don't evolve at a time.

01:11:59.780 --> 01:12:02.380
They come in whole
packages, packages

01:12:02.380 --> 01:12:04.430
making you wag
your tail and such.

01:12:04.430 --> 01:12:07.492
So there is some other
punctuated thing going on.

01:12:07.492 --> 01:12:10.200
And that's its pattern
happening there.

01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:12.900
And then meanwhile, you've
got some other trait moving,

01:12:12.900 --> 01:12:15.590
evolving in a punctuated manner.

01:12:15.590 --> 01:12:17.810
I guess it doesn't go down.

01:12:17.810 --> 01:12:19.930
And you put enough
of these together

01:12:19.930 --> 01:12:22.500
and have enough punctuated
events happening,

01:12:22.500 --> 01:12:25.660
and on a whole
population level, you've

01:12:25.660 --> 01:12:27.690
just invented gradualism.

01:12:27.690 --> 01:12:29.350
You don't have to choose.

01:12:29.350 --> 01:12:30.660
You can have it all.

01:12:30.660 --> 01:12:31.760
You can have it all.

01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:33.560
So a resolution there.

01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:35.890
Both are almost
certainly happening.

01:12:35.890 --> 01:12:37.680
So what does this
set us up for now?

01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:39.800
Now that we have
finished this bucket,

01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:43.630
we are now ready on
Friday-- what is today?

01:12:43.630 --> 01:12:44.130
Wednesday.

01:12:44.130 --> 01:12:46.920
We are now ready on Friday to
move to the next bucket, which

01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:50.380
is a very different world
of trying to make sense

01:12:50.380 --> 01:12:52.130
of the genetics of behavior.

01:12:52.130 --> 01:12:54.790
Last week's version,
you make up stories

01:12:54.790 --> 01:12:56.640
built around
individual selection,

01:12:56.640 --> 01:12:58.920
kin selection, group
selection, and come up

01:12:58.920 --> 01:13:00.662
with the best story
around to show

01:13:00.662 --> 01:13:01.870
me something more predictive.

01:13:01.870 --> 01:13:02.860
And you win.

01:13:02.860 --> 01:13:06.670
This week's version, showing
actual genetic changes

01:13:06.670 --> 01:13:08.020
over the course of time.

01:13:08.020 --> 01:13:10.770
What patterns of
evolutionary change

01:13:10.770 --> 01:13:13.200
will those code for
with what consequences

01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:17.150
for understanding the evolution
of behavior, competition,

01:13:17.150 --> 01:13:19.090
reproductive
strategies, all of that?

01:13:19.090 --> 01:13:21.050
By the end of this
week, switching over

01:13:21.050 --> 01:13:24.290
instead to the world of
behavior geneticists, where

01:13:24.290 --> 01:13:27.070
they try to understand
what's going on by looking

01:13:27.070 --> 01:13:30.200
at-- so somebody gets adopted.

01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:33.290
Do they share a trait more
with their adoptive parents

01:13:33.290 --> 01:13:35.340
or their biological parents?

01:13:35.340 --> 01:13:38.870
You look at identical twins
versus non-identical ones.

01:13:38.870 --> 01:13:41.600
You look at identical
twins who were adopted

01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:44.790
into different families right at
birth, put them back together.

01:13:44.790 --> 01:13:47.280
A whole world of trying
to make sense that way.

01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:49.190
And what we'll see
is the same deal

01:13:49.190 --> 01:13:52.410
is with this-- what counts
as finishing, coming up

01:13:52.410 --> 01:13:55.010
with an explanation--
last week's social biology

01:13:55.010 --> 01:13:56.900
approaches-- this
version of this

01:13:56.900 --> 01:13:59.620
is the starting point
for the next discipline.

01:13:59.620 --> 01:14:02.400
So we'll pick up
on that on Friday.

01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:02.990
Oh, my god.

01:14:02.990 --> 01:14:04.600
He let us out--

01:14:04.600 --> 01:14:07.850
