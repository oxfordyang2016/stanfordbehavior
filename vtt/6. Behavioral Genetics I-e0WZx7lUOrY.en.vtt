[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:05.941
Stanford University.

00:00:08.647 --> 00:00:10.928
[SIDE CONVERSATIONS]

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.230
OK, let's get going.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:19.260
Let's see.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.690
First off, apologies for Friday.

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.440
Sometimes, what seems
like a flawless set

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.130
of connecting flights on paper
turn out not to be in reality.

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.130
So hopefully, people made
good use of the time.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:32.900
OK.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.120
We are ready for our next
bucket, our next bucket,

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.780
our third one in this
series, just in time

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.520
to convince you that we
just keep jumping these.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.330
As soon as you get accustomed
to one approach, here

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.260
we are, yet another
one, where we

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.041
are going to trash everything
that's come before us.

00:00:49.041 --> 00:00:49.540
OK.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.690
What have been the two
broad approaches so far?

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.060
The first one, the
sociobiological/evolutionary

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.100
psychology one--
behavior evolves

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.740
exactly under the same sort
of wind tunnel of selection

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.550
as does the heart of
a giraffe, blah, blah,

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:06.710
that whole song and dance.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.550
Following certain
rules, you could

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.140
generate fairly
structured predictions

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.860
about social behavior.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.710
And then, the we-win
version of using that is,

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:17.940
here's what we predict.

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.460
Here is the way we explain
this complex system

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.170
of social behavior,
using these rules which

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.940
assume certain degrees of
heritability of behavior,

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.740
following certain
rules of evolution.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.840
And until you come up
with a better explanation

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.970
for how this goes on, we win.

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.070
This is how behavior works.

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.410
Then we shifted over
to the molecular end.

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:42.940
And what we saw was, on a
certain sort of trendy level,

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.430
molecular biology is the
answer to the people who

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.310
would sit around to
the sociobiologists

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.230
and say, show me the genes.

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:50.920
Show me the genes
for what you keep

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.720
talking about inferentially.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.500
And what we saw was how
evolutionary change works out

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:57.590
in the DNA level.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.420
Very importantly,
the common mechanisms

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.830
for microevolutionary
change and how that supports

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.500
the picture of gradualism.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.889
And then seeing all of these
relatively new, unexpected ways

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:12.230
in which you are getting
big time changes in DNA,

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.840
all these amplifying
effects of macroevolution,

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.880
and suddenly support for
punctuated equilibrium

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.180
in two ways.

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.900
The first one being,
as soon as you

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.320
get one, little, tiny mutation
affecting transcription

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.570
factors, affecting
splicing enzymes,

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.840
affecting entire
networks, it is going

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.780
to be real rare
that you don't get

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.850
a mutation that's a disaster.

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.440
Stabilizing.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.070
Stasis, that's the
long-term feature

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:40.950
of the punctuated equilibrium.

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.420
The equilibrium part
and the punctuated

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.450
seeing how, under circumstances
of extreme selection,

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.130
something that is come up with
is wildly adaptive, wildly

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.100
advantageous, quickly
fixates in the society.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.731
And thus, we have
step functions.

00:02:56.731 --> 00:02:57.230
OK.

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.100
So what we do today--
and Wednesday is now

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.880
shift to another field--
thinking about behavior

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.530
in a genetic context,
in a heritable context,

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.610
this whole field of
behavior genetics.

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.510
And what you'll see is,
depending on your stripe,

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.480
either these are a bunch of
really powerful approaches

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.570
for being able to infer some
sort of genetic components

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.470
to behavior, often getting
a whole lot of insight

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.080
into what's going on,
and in some cases,

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.450
a more negative view,
more critical one,

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.900
the entire field is gibberish.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.230
And a way to summarize the
view of it as being gibberish

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.280
was this great cartoon
I saw a while back.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.100
OK, two scientists are
standing around the lab.

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:41.720
And they've got
their lab coats on,

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.850
and their test tubes, and going
about doing science stuff.

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.750
And one of them is
saying to the other one,

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.910
you know how sometimes you're
on the phone with someone,

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:51.860
and you've been talking
for a long time,

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.160
and it seems like they
decide they want to get off,

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.160
but they don't want to
say they want to get off,

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.537
so they say, I probably
shouldn't keep you any longer,

00:03:58.537 --> 00:04:00.620
even though you're not the
one wanting to get off,

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.494
because they're the one
who wants to get off?

00:04:02.494 --> 00:04:05.178
Well, I think I found
the gene for that.

00:04:05.178 --> 00:04:06.126
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:06.126 --> 00:04:09.420
And that winds up being one of
the criticisms of the behavior

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:10.000
genetics.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.330
Once again, this world of
inferring genetic bases

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:19.390
to behavior in often the most
deterministic possible way

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:23.490
and using techniques which
are often complete nonsense.

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.280
And what we'll see are the
tools of behavior geneticists,

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.030
and all the criticisms,
and why this winds up

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:30.890
being a very contentious field.

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:31.410
OK.

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.930
So this being another version
of getting at, how do you

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.530
know when a behavior
has a genetic component.

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.200
And we're immediately
allowing ourselves

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.720
to be a little more subtle
here, not determined by genes,

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.020
not determined purely by nature.

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.960
All of that merely to
have a genetic component,

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.130
a genetic influence, how
do you begin to do that?

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.890
And this is a world where
people, the scientists,

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:58.960
don't sit around coming up
with evolutionary models.

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.710
They don't sit around trying
to find mutations in genes.

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.550
They have a very different
sort of strategy.

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.190
They look for patterns
of shared traits

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.390
among the individuals who
have differing degrees

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:16.470
of shared genes and
infer, related to this,

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:19.360
and infer genetic
influences from that.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.490
OK, what's the simplest most
mindless version of doing this?

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:25.960
The basic initial
rules, centuries ago,

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.440
when behavior genetics
started , was the notion,

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.090
if you see a trait that
is universal in a species,

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:33.910
obviously, it's genetic.

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:35.500
Obviously, it's hard-wired.

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.250
Obviously, it's instinctual.

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:40.270
Obviously, that's an
extremely limited approach.

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:41.070
Yes, indeed.

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:43.910
You will see some
species, like flies,

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:46.520
in which certain behavioral
traits are determined

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:50.060
by relatively small numbers
of genes and are universal.

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:51.940
This is obviously
going to fall apart

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.910
when you get to something
more interesting than a fly.

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:57.090
So what's a much more
the starting point

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:00.820
for the whole field
is to say, ooh, look.

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:05.490
Here's some behavioral
traits that run in families.

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:07.140
Genes run in families.

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:09.100
Therefore, we may have
just found evidence

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:11.550
for a genetic influence
on these traits.

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:13.190
And of course, it
takes about an eighth

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:16.400
of a second to come up with the
retort to that, which is, yes,

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:20.010
genes run in families, but
environment runs in families

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:21.380
as well.

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.240
So the standard
response is to now

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.480
put a little bit more
strictures on it,

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:29.070
to say, OK, it's not just
that genes run in families,

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:32.930
but as we know, from a few weeks
ago, the more closely related

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:35.630
you are, the more genes
you share in common.

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:38.320
Our Mendelian rule
of half the genes

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:39.960
with full sibling, et cetera.

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:44.450
Following thus, the logic that,
if you have a behavioral trait

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:47.970
that becomes more common
the more closely related two

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:51.170
individuals are, now
you're inferring something

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:52.620
about genetics.

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:55.570
And of course, the
problem there is not only,

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:58.690
as you become more closely
related to somebody,

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:01.450
do you share a greater
percentage of your genes,

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:03.420
you share environment more.

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:06.850
Obviously, you are sharing
environment on the average,

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:09.550
in most cases, much
more with a sibling than

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:12.030
with a first cousin, than
with an eighth cousin.

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:15.440
The trouble is shared genes
and shared environment

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:17.370
tend to co-variant families.

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:21.380
So that greatly weakens what
was the initial classic approach

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:24.080
to the field 70, 80 years ago.

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:24.740
OK.

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:26.740
So you've got to come up
with something fancier,

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:29.220
something more informative,
something more subtle.

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:31.550
And what you wind
up doing then is,

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:33.870
let's control for environment.

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:35.630
Yes, obviously,
the eighth cousin

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:38.220
is living in a different
world than your full sibling.

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:41.560
Let's control for environment
under circumstances

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:44.020
where you examine
relatives where

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:46.550
they have the same
environment, and they

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:49.980
differ in terms of the
amount of genes they share.

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:52.300
And what is this
classic approach?

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:57.200
Look at identical twins
versus fraternal twins,

00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:03.020
monozygotic twins, from one
zygote, monozygotic, identical

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:06.840
twins versus dizygotic.

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:10.540
And the general notion there
is, OK, identical twins

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:13.090
share 100% of their genes.

00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:17.140
Fraternal twins share
50% of their genes.

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:22.960
So if identical twins are raised
in the exact same environment,

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:27.000
and fraternal twins are raised
in the exact same environment,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.120
they all have
environments shared.

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:31.520
What's the only
difference then to explain

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:33.909
any behavioral
differences, if you

00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:36.799
see a trait that is
shared to a greater

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:41.539
extent in a pair of identical
twins, than in fraternal twins?

00:08:41.539 --> 00:08:42.669
What's the only difference?

00:08:42.669 --> 00:08:44.870
They all grow up with
identical environments.

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:48.030
It's because the identical
twins have twice the amount

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:50.390
of genes in common, 100%.

00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:55.010
You could thus infer a genetic
influence on that trait,

00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:57.410
because it's the
identical environment.

00:08:57.410 --> 00:08:59.720
Twins get raised
absolutely the same.

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:01.850
And the only difference
is the degree

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:04.380
of relatedness, the
degree of shared

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:08.200
genes between monozygotic
and dizygotic twins.

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:11.620
That one should take about
2/8 of a second to demolish,

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:13.770
for the simple
starting point that,

00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:16.940
oh, yeah, sometimes fraternal
twins, dizygotic twins,

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:18.850
are different sexes.

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:19.350
OK.

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:20.570
So that complicates things.

00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:23.200
So you come back and you're a
little bit more rigorous now.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:26.490
And you restrict your
comparisons of monozygotic

00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:31.050
to dizygotic, to
same-sex dizygotic pairs.

00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:33.060
And then you
institute this rule,

00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:36.980
OK, same-sex twins, whether
identical or fraternal,

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:39.450
are raised essentially
in the same environment.

00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:40.540
The same environment.

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:43.950
So if you see a greater
sharing of traits

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:47.100
among the monozygotic
twins than the dizygotic,

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:50.590
the only place that greater
sharing could be attributed to

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:53.940
is the fact that they
have more genes in common.

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:54.440
Ah.

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:57.450
We have just identified
a behavior that

00:09:57.450 --> 00:10:00.250
has a strong genetic component.

00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:02.060
So the big problem
with that approach

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:05.830
is-- anyone-- who's
a twin in here?

00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:06.594
Whoa.

00:10:06.594 --> 00:10:07.510
That's a lot of hands.

00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:10.290
Identical twins?

00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:13.280
Dizygotic twins?

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:13.880
Any triplets?

00:10:16.891 --> 00:10:17.390
OK.

00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:20.250
Just to extend that,
armadillos always

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:23.652
give birth to four
identical offspring at once.

00:10:23.652 --> 00:10:26.351
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:26.351 --> 00:10:26.850
OK.

00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:27.410
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:31.160
So that having been prompted,
what we then move on to

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:34.300
is the obvious problem
with this entire approach.

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:35.120
Hurray.

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:39.290
Monozygotic twins get raised in
virtually the same environment.

00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:41.720
Dizygotic twins
of the same gender

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:43.880
get raised in virtually
the same environment.

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:46.010
That's not true
in the slightest.

00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:48.830
There is far more
differentiation of environment

00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:52.610
for dizygotic twins than
for monozygotic twins.

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:55.950
They are treated
differently, as pairs.

00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:58.480
Thus, if behavioral
traits are more in

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:02.080
common between monozygotic
twins than between dizygotic,

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:05.250
it could be because these guys
share more genes in common,

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:08.920
and/or because they share
more environment, a completely

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:11.400
flawed approach in that regard.

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:13.370
The next complication.

00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:16.750
It turns out, monozygotic
twins don't always

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:18.860
have the exact same environment.

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:19.640
Well, yes.

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:22.720
Obviously, one of them gets
sneezed on at a higher rate

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:24.730
by a kid sister, or something.

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:28.040
And that's going to produce just
decades worth of consequences.

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:31.460
But even in other
domains, monozygotic twins

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:35.610
don't get treated exactly the
same, in some circumstances.

00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:40.511
And here is what it looks
like, if I had drawn it.

00:11:40.511 --> 00:11:41.010
OK.

00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:45.580
So you've got your twins.

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:47.410
And this is during fetal life.

00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:51.280
And there are fetuses in there.

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:56.590
And OK, there's one with
a little thing of hair.

00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:58.960
And there's the other.

00:11:58.960 --> 00:11:59.900
OK.

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:04.230
And what you have
is a placenta forms.

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:05.260
And here's the deal.

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:11.470
With monozygotic twins, if they
split during the first five

00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:14.260
days after conception,
they wind up,

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.930
each one, with
their own placenta.

00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:20.560
On the other hand, if the
split occurs between days five

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:24.710
and 10, there's already
commitment to one placenta,

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:26.730
which they then share.

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:33.280
So monochorionic
pregnancy, or bichorionic.

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:35.390
And what does that
wind up meaning?

00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:38.380
In the monochorionic,
the two fetuses

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:41.410
share a blood stream,
to a greater extent,

00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:44.110
than in the bichorionic
circumstance.

00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:48.120
In these cases, it's
separate blood flow from mom.

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:50.220
OK, it's still the same
mom, and it's still

00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:52.530
ultimately the same
blood, but it's

00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:55.370
going to be subtle differences
in the levels of stuff

00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:56.480
in the bloodstream.

00:12:56.480 --> 00:13:01.160
With the monochorionic, the
environment for these fetuses

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:03.570
are much more similar,
in terms of whatever

00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:05.390
is carried in the bloodstream.

00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:06.500
OK, great.

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:08.050
That's a great factoid.

00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:10.930
And that's like interesting,
things about identical twins.

00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:13.520
But like different
levels of nutrients,

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:16.220
whether it's coming off
of a blood vessel here,

00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:18.930
versus there, OK, maybe
that makes a difference.

00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:21.120
But these are going to
be minuscule differences.

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:22.310
Nothing interesting.

00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:27.380
As one example of it,
monochorionic identical twins

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:32.930
have more similar IQs than do
bichorionic identical twins.

00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:36.490
Just one demonstration that
this could make a difference.

00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:38.120
This is relevant.

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:40.430
The IQs are more similar.

00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:44.080
And this has been one reason
why marmoset monkeys-- marmoset

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:46.630
monkeys, pair
bonding, so you know

00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:48.830
what they're all about--
among other things,

00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:51.570
marmoset monkey mothers
always give birth

00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:54.430
to twins, because there is
two parents around to take

00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:55.130
care of them.

00:13:55.130 --> 00:13:58.680
And it's got a completely
screwy circulatory system

00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:01.300
for the twins that are
unlike either of these.

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:03.100
And there's all sorts
of people who've

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:05.540
been interested in
marmosets over the years--

00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:08.470
the ones who couldn't afford
to by themselves armadillos--

00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:13.240
interested in terms of looking
at the differences in blood

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:16.190
flow during fetal
life there of twins.

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:16.690
OK.

00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:20.180
So we start off here that,
just because you see something

00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:21.770
more in common in
monozygotic twins

00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:23.920
than dizygotic, that
doesn't tell you

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:26.470
the first thing about
whether it's genes involved.

00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:28.660
They share our
environment much more.

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:30.400
Then even trying to
make sense of what's

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:32.570
going on in monozygotic.

00:14:32.570 --> 00:14:35.220
What you've got there
are fundamental potential

00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:37.530
differences,
environment, starting

00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:40.610
at a very important
early state of life.

00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:43.870
So monochorionic
versus bichorionic.

00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:45.320
What else then?

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:51.450
How about another one where you
can look at a behavioral trait,

00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:53.980
looking at traits and
traits differences,

00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:56.920
according to some
genetic trait and where

00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:58.730
environment is the same?

00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:01.090
How about gender differences?

00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:02.030
Whoa.

00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:02.540
OK.

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:04.890
So genes have something
to do with producing

00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:06.147
what your gender is.

00:15:06.147 --> 00:15:09.200
And environment being
the same, if you

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:11.340
see differences between
females and males,

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:14.410
that's attributable to
the different genetics.

00:15:14.410 --> 00:15:15.150
OK.

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:18.120
And you should be able to nuke
that one within seconds, as

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:20.960
well, which is the
notion of shared

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:23.780
environment, the notion
of identical environmental

00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:24.770
experience.

00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:26.850
To give you a sense
of how subtle this

00:15:26.850 --> 00:15:32.030
is, at one hour of life, on the
average, the level of activity,

00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:35.270
the rate of movement, the
amount of movement of limbs,

00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:38.520
on the average, is
greater among newborn boys

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:40.560
than newborn girls.

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:41.540
Whoa.

00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:46.940
That's there like within
an hour of getting born.

00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:48.870
That's not a whole lot
of time for environment

00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:49.950
having gone on there.

00:15:49.950 --> 00:15:52.680
Maybe you're seeing a
strong genetic effect.

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:55.980
What other studies have shown
is, from the first moments

00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:59.360
of post-natal life,
mothers are already

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:03.430
interacting differently with
baby girls than with baby boys.

00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:07.130
From the first interaction, from
the very first holding of them,

00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:09.780
there's differences in
how long they are held.

00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:12.400
There are differences in
proximity to the body,

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:13.460
to the face.

00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:14.690
So Whoa.

00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:17.170
Sex differences in
behavior at one hour.

00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:20.550
Sex differences in environment
within mere moments

00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:22.240
after being born.

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:24.200
So that weakens that one.

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:26.740
And this came through
in another realm.

00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:29.390
This was a study that was
done in the '80s, that

00:16:29.390 --> 00:16:34.150
was enormously influential, by
a pair of scientists at Johns

00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:36.720
Hopkins, Benbow and Stanley.

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:39.800
And it had to do with a program
that I'd bet a lot of you

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:41.900
guys had something or
other to do with back

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:47.190
when, which is the Johns
Hopkins Gifted Youth Program

00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:49.870
thing, which I bet
all sorts of you

00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:51.940
guys qualified for
at various points

00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:55.290
and got the Johns Hopkins
blue ribbons pasted

00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:56.340
to your forehead.

00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:59.150
And that was part of
this massive study that's

00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:02.670
been going on for decades
and decades of kids who

00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:05.067
are very gifted,
academically, and in a number

00:17:05.067 --> 00:17:05.900
of different realms.

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:08.849
And Benbow and Stanley were
some of the senior researchers

00:17:08.849 --> 00:17:09.880
on this.

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:12.520
And this was a study
they did when they had

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:15.200
40,000 kids in their database.

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:17.359
And they asked a
very simple question,

00:17:17.359 --> 00:17:21.099
which was, well, what
does IQ distribution

00:17:21.099 --> 00:17:25.940
look like in this population as
a function of what sex you are?

00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:29.940
And back came a very
interesting finding,

00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:33.710
which was a highly, highly,
highly significant difference

00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:37.510
in the average IQ
between girls and boys,

00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:41.350
in the direction of
boys having a higher IQ.

00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:45.520
Moreover, when you looked at
the tail of the distribution,

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:48.540
the highest IQ
range, what you saw

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:54.650
there was approximately a 13:1
ratio, way out at this extreme.

00:17:54.650 --> 00:17:57.900
They then followed up and did
the exact same thing-- no,

00:17:57.900 --> 00:17:59.320
they didn't do IQ.

00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:00.320
What am I talking about?

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:02.430
They did math.

00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:03.150
Ignore that.

00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:04.010
Erase all of that.

00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:05.130
OK, let's start over.

00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:05.630
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:10.660
So lots of you probably got the
Benbow and Stanley sweatshirts

00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:12.180
when you were part
of that program.

00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:16.010
So they were looking at math
skills, yes, junior high school

00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:18.930
kids who were taking the
math part of the SATs.

00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:22.880
That's part of getting
into this Hopkins program.

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:26.530
So they took the math SATs and
they looked at those 40,000

00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:29.560
scores and saw that
there was a gender

00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:32.800
difference in the average
score on the math SATs,

00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:34.630
with boys scoring higher.

00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:36.710
Not only that, but
when they looked out

00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:39.800
at the tail here-- OK, I'm back
on track-- when they looked out

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:42.250
at the tail here at the
highest math achievement,

00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:46.220
there was a ratio of
13:1, boys to girls

00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:48.800
OK, so that was pretty striking.

00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:51.560
And in their paper, which
was published in Science,

00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:54.080
was a very, very
critical phrase.

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:57.320
Their rationale for
doing this study on kids

00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:59.450
that age was the
fact that-- at least,

00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:01.620
at the time in most
schools, middle school,

00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:05.680
junior high school-- kids have
not differentiated classes yet.

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:07.110
They're not yet
at the point where

00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:10.560
you could choose to take
extra math classes, to choose

00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:12.220
to take the absolute minimum.

00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:15.370
This was still the stage where
most kids in this country

00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:17.650
are getting the exact
same math classes.

00:19:17.650 --> 00:19:19.840
Everyone is still
getting the same.

00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:23.360
And thus, at that point, they
could include in their paper

00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:27.460
a phrase along the lines of,
since all the children had

00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:31.800
essentially identical
educational environments,

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:35.600
any gender differences
seen in it are reflecting--

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:37.800
and they used the
word, "biological"--

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:40.760
are reflecting
biological differences.

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:44.500
This was one hell
of a famous study.

00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:47.950
This was front page
all over the place.

00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:52.960
This wound up being shown in
a very large article in Time,

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:55.680
and in Newsweek, the
Reader's Digest--

00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:58.150
which I know, sort of,
everyone is supposed

00:19:58.150 --> 00:20:00.750
to make fun of-- but the
Reader's Digest, at least--

00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:02.150
does it still exist?

00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:02.650
Yes.

00:20:02.650 --> 00:20:03.450
Yes, it does.

00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:03.950
OK.

00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:06.330
Throughout the 1980s,
the Reader's Digest

00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:08.340
was the most widely
read magazine

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:10.590
in this country,
which is astonishing,

00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:13.240
showing what percentage of
people read in the bathroom,

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:15.890
so having to go with the
Reader's Digest there.

00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:20.660
And the Reader's Digest covered
this and used the phrase,

00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:24.200
"The math gene,"
and discussing how

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:27.760
this was the definitive study
showing that more boys have

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:30.150
the "math gene."

00:20:30.150 --> 00:20:32.610
Like, you already know
that's like nonsense

00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:34.780
on so many different levels.

00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:36.430
But this was all over the place.

00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:38.690
This was the study
that definitively

00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:43.470
showed genetic differences
in math skills by sex,

00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:47.600
and definitively showed that
this was manifest at a stage

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:50.500
before there were different
educational environments,

00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:51.950
in terms of math.

00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:54.530
And what, of course,
completely rips apart

00:20:54.530 --> 00:20:57.630
that study-- and it was shameful
that thing was ever published,

00:20:57.630 --> 00:20:59.420
let alone got as
much attention as it

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:02.930
did-- is the fact that the
environment was not exactly

00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:03.570
the same.

00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:06.570
Endless number of studies
have shown, beginning

00:21:06.570 --> 00:21:09.470
by first grade, if
it is a simple math

00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:12.280
problem at that stage for
the same hands put up,

00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:15.640
a boy is more likely to
be called on than a girl.

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:18.430
Studies showing that, for
the same correct answer,

00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:20.330
boys in elementary
schools are more

00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:23.840
likely to be praised for the
correct answer than are girls.

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:27.100
By the time junior high
school is coming around,

00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:29.740
guidance counselors are
already differentially,

00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:33.080
by sex, advising, once
you get into high school,

00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:35.160
to take more elective math.

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:38.670
Tremendous, massive
differences in environment.

00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:41.760
And this study, using
this whole argument of,

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:43.990
if there's an
identical environment,

00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:47.060
and you see differences,
it's due to genes.

00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:49.340
And predicated on
that, if that's not

00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:52.550
true in our afterlife,
it was ludicrous

00:21:52.550 --> 00:21:55.370
that they were making this
argument about 13-year-olds.

00:21:55.370 --> 00:21:58.700
So this was a paper
with enormous influence

00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:01.420
in every major newspaper
in the country.

00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:05.220
Scientists have discovered
the "math gene."

00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:08.300
And boys have them
more than girls.

00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:11.010
We will come back to
that study later on,

00:22:11.010 --> 00:22:14.080
because something much, much
more interesting was going on.

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:14.720
OK.

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:18.660
So those were the limits in
the sex difference end of it.

00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:20.490
So what can you do next?

00:22:20.490 --> 00:22:22.840
There's a flip side,
another approach,

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:25.110
that the behavior
geneticists use, which

00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:26.850
is basically the converse.

00:22:26.850 --> 00:22:29.440
Now, you look at
individuals getting

00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:35.370
raised in the same environment
who don't share genes.

00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:38.240
Same environment,
different genes.

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:40.370
Rather than just now
the different genes,

00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:43.520
same environment nonsense
about gender differences,

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:46.500
even down to monozygotic
twins, all of that,

00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:48.915
but now the flip
side, same environment

00:22:48.915 --> 00:22:50.950
and different genes.

00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:53.150
What was the paradigm for this?

00:22:53.150 --> 00:22:55.800
The one that is used over,
and over, and over again,

00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:58.100
the standard approach in
this part of the field

00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:00.860
is adoption studies.

00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:04.580
You take someone who
is adopted as a child,

00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:08.280
and they are now raised
in a household of people

00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:11.990
who they are not related to,
their adoptive, non-biological

00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:12.900
parents.

00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:14.580
And what you now
begin to look at

00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:17.110
are patterns of shared traits.

00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:19.790
Specifically, what
is looked at is,

00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:23.360
when you see a trait in
someone who was adopted,

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:26.510
who are they more likely
to share that trait with?

00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:30.220
Their biological
parents, or parent?

00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:33.270
Or with an adoptive parent?

00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:35.900
Now, the logic of this is
completely straightforward.

00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:38.860
And this has been sort of the
standard paradigm in animal

00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:41.870
studies of the genetics
of behavior for centuries,

00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:43.950
something called
cross-fostering.

00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:48.710
You take a newborn litter
and another newborn litter,

00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:51.750
and you switch them
between moms so that they

00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:53.105
were raised by different moms.

00:23:53.105 --> 00:23:57.140
And they're raised with, thus,
someone they're not related to,

00:23:57.140 --> 00:24:01.280
but someone who they now have
environmental shared with them.

00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:03.700
Or in the litter
cross-fostering studies,

00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:05.930
you will take half of
a litter and switch it

00:24:05.930 --> 00:24:10.310
to another mother, half-- so
you see how the iterations there

00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:10.870
go.

00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:12.920
So that was essentially
the rationale

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:15.060
for how this would
be done in humans.

00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:18.560
And this was the
basis of one study

00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:21.410
in the late '60s,
early '70s, which

00:24:21.410 --> 00:24:26.910
was the landmark study
in genetic psychiatry,

00:24:26.910 --> 00:24:29.900
in behavioral genetics as a
whole, a study carried out

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:33.390
by a guy at Harvard,
named Seymour Kety.

00:24:33.390 --> 00:24:38.620
And this was a phenomenal study
and phenomenally important.

00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:40.130
Here's what Kety did.

00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:44.740
Kety was dealing with the
notion at the time of making

00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:46.370
sense of schizophrenia.

00:24:46.370 --> 00:24:49.290
And as we will see when we get
to the schizophrenia lecture,

00:24:49.290 --> 00:24:51.930
the number of nutty
ideas out there as

00:24:51.930 --> 00:24:55.430
to what the cause of this
disease is is just staggering.

00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:57.350
But what he was
interested in was

00:24:57.350 --> 00:25:01.130
getting at the notion that
was kind of floating around

00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:03.570
in some corners of the
field at the time, which

00:25:03.570 --> 00:25:06.950
is schizophrenia has a
biological component,

00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:08.750
a genetic component.

00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:12.470
And what that was was
viewed as very unlikely.

00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:15.850
But what Kety did was
try to go and test this.

00:25:15.850 --> 00:25:17.590
So what's he going to do?

00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:20.850
He's going to look at
adopted individuals who

00:25:20.850 --> 00:25:23.160
are schizophrenic
and see are they

00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:26.170
more likely to share that
trait with a biological parent

00:25:26.170 --> 00:25:27.100
or adoptive parent.

00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:28.730
You see the logic already.

00:25:28.730 --> 00:25:31.730
OK, how many
schizophrenic adoptees

00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:33.970
are you going to find
out there where you also

00:25:33.970 --> 00:25:36.760
were able to figure out who
the biological parents were.

00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:38.530
This was not an easy task.

00:25:38.530 --> 00:25:41.270
And Kety's insight,
his intuition,

00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:44.620
was to go to one of the places
on Earth where that was most

00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:47.590
easily done, which
is Scandinavia,

00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:51.390
where all the Scandinavian
countries keep records like you

00:25:51.390 --> 00:25:54.190
cannot believe about
everything on Earth.

00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:56.230
People understanding,
for example,

00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:59.310
how the age of
puberty onset in girls

00:25:59.310 --> 00:26:01.420
have been decreasing
for centuries.

00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:03.790
They're always using
Scandinavian data,

00:26:03.790 --> 00:26:06.720
because every single thing
that could possibly be recorded

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:09.200
has been written down and
stored someplace there

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:11.120
in moth-proof vaults.

00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:14.730
And what he was able to do in
ways that no human subjects

00:26:14.730 --> 00:26:16.880
committee on earth would
approve these days,

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:21.970
is go through the entire
database of adoptees in Denmark

00:26:21.970 --> 00:26:26.930
and identify all of the cases
where somebody adopted had

00:26:26.930 --> 00:26:29.450
wound up with
schizophrenia, and then

00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:32.760
able to go back and see
who the biological parents

00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:34.630
and the adoptive parents were.

00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:37.360
Was a staggeringly large study.

00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:41.670
He and a team of psychiatrists
spent years in Denmark

00:26:41.670 --> 00:26:44.050
doing this, because one
of the things they did

00:26:44.050 --> 00:26:45.770
was they then did follow-ups.

00:26:45.770 --> 00:26:48.670
And they themselves
interviewed all

00:26:48.670 --> 00:26:51.470
of the potentially
schizophrenic individuals

00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:52.990
on there, so that
they would have

00:26:52.990 --> 00:26:56.760
the same diagnostic standards
all across the board.

00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:58.650
As we'll see in the
schizophrenia lecture,

00:26:58.650 --> 00:27:01.230
it's a very squishy diagnosis.

00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:04.740
So having the same
psychiatrists interviewing

00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:08.590
every possible person,
hugely important control.

00:27:08.590 --> 00:27:10.790
This is part of what took
them years and years.

00:27:10.790 --> 00:27:13.180
And then they finally
were able to say

00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:16.100
what the patterns
of similarity were.

00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:18.160
And here's what they
wound up saying.

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:21.320
You take any random
person on the street who

00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:25.010
is schizophrenic, and you
take any other random person

00:27:25.010 --> 00:27:27.630
off the street, and you
ask what are the odds

00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:29.980
that the second person
shares this trait

00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:31.420
with the first person?

00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:33.500
About 1% likelihood.

00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:35.610
What's that another
way of stating?

00:27:35.610 --> 00:27:37.280
In the population
as a whole, there's

00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:41.180
about a 1% incidence
of schizophrenia.

00:27:41.180 --> 00:27:43.570
So you start with
the circumstance

00:27:43.570 --> 00:27:47.310
where the biological
parents, neither of them

00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:51.790
had schizophrenia, and neither
of the adoptive parents do.

00:27:51.790 --> 00:27:54.880
And what's the incidence in
this population among adoptees?

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:57.220
A 1% schizophrenia rate.

00:27:57.220 --> 00:27:59.880
That's just average
people off the street.

00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:03.890
That's the usual rate across
Western European population.

00:28:03.890 --> 00:28:05.470
So 1% rate.

00:28:05.470 --> 00:28:09.380
Now, let's have the
person growing up

00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:11.120
in a different
sort of household.

00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:14.710
This is a person who
has no biological legacy

00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:16.930
of schizophrenia,
but was brought up

00:28:16.930 --> 00:28:21.700
in an adoptive household
with a schizophrenic parent.

00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:25.340
And what you saw
then was a 3% chance,

00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:27.630
which, with this
enormous sample size,

00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:30.910
was a highly significant,
reliable number.

00:28:30.910 --> 00:28:35.230
So in a rough kind of way,
being raised in a household

00:28:35.230 --> 00:28:37.740
with an adoptive parent
who is schizophrenic

00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:42.450
approximately triples your risk
of a schizophrenia diagnosis.

00:28:42.450 --> 00:28:46.020
But then, the really
critical one, which is you

00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:48.610
were raised in a household
where neither parent,

00:28:48.610 --> 00:28:50.710
adoptive parent,
is schizophrenic,

00:28:50.710 --> 00:28:55.260
but you have a biological legacy
among your biological parents

00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:56.400
of schizophrenia.

00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:57.960
What do you see?

00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:01.090
A 9% incidence.

00:29:01.090 --> 00:29:05.260
Approximately a three-fold
increase above that, almost

00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:07.830
a 10-fold difference
now over what you

00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:09.780
see in the general population.

00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:13.670
This one number was what
roared through the field.

00:29:13.670 --> 00:29:15.900
This was viewed as
the clearest evidence

00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:20.680
to date for a genetic component
to a psychiatric disorder.

00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:23.730
Regular old person off
the street, 1% rate.

00:29:23.730 --> 00:29:26.350
Have a biological parent
with schizophrenia

00:29:26.350 --> 00:29:29.460
and share no environment with
them, because you got adopted

00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:33.740
away, and almost 10-fold higher
chance of getting the disease.

00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:37.900
Then, final thing, looking at
the incredibly rare people who

00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:40.760
got screwed on more different
fronts than you can imagine,

00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:44.680
who had a biological parent
with schizophrenia, and phew,

00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:47.114
got out of there, and landed
in an adoptive household

00:29:47.114 --> 00:29:48.280
with a schizophrenic parent.

00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:48.780
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:50.760
So you get the
double whammy there.

00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:54.330
And what you saw
was a 17% incidence.

00:29:54.330 --> 00:29:57.280
What's interesting
about that number?

00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:00.670
OK, what this cell does,
what this number does,

00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:03.500
is reflect the
increased risk by having

00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:05.710
a biological legacy
of schizophrenia,

00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:07.610
plus the increased
risk of having

00:30:07.610 --> 00:30:10.479
an adoptive environmental
legacy of schizophrenia.

00:30:10.479 --> 00:30:11.020
So let's see.

00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:13.074
What's the difference
between 1 and 3?

00:30:13.074 --> 00:30:14.060
That's 2.

00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:16.430
So the difference between
1 and 9, that's 8.

00:30:16.430 --> 00:30:20.270
So thus, it should be
about 10 percentage points.

00:30:20.270 --> 00:30:22.420
It should be about a 10% rate.

00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:23.830
What are you seeing here?

00:30:23.830 --> 00:30:25.440
A synergism.

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:29.150
Get yourself a biological
legacy and get yourself

00:30:29.150 --> 00:30:31.700
a schizophrenia
household to grow up in,

00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:36.030
and it is not just adding
the two degrees of risk.

00:30:36.030 --> 00:30:39.470
There was a synergism, a
non-additive synergism.

00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:42.660
That is an important hint
for us of stuff to come.

00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:45.080
So this was this landmark study.

00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:48.310
This was phenomenally
difficult to have pulled off.

00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:51.700
It got Kety a number of
Nobel Prize nominations.

00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:56.040
This was the study that showed
the first definitive modern

00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:59.220
science evidence for
a heritable basis

00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:01.060
to a psychiatric disorder.

00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:03.680
And this became
the gold standard

00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:06.520
for how to do behavioral
genetic studies.

00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:08.650
And in the aftermath
of that, people

00:31:08.650 --> 00:31:12.500
began to do adoptive
studies on heritability

00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:14.930
between biological and
adoptive households,

00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:20.220
heritability of depression,
heritability of alcoholism,

00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:22.940
heritability of criminality.

00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:25.270
And you can see heading
off in all sorts

00:31:25.270 --> 00:31:28.270
of interesting directions
from there all sorts

00:31:28.270 --> 00:31:30.800
of interesting ones, and
them always producing

00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:34.910
a number that would be higher
in this cell of the matrix

00:31:34.910 --> 00:31:37.650
than that cell, and always
producing the notion

00:31:37.650 --> 00:31:41.840
that one has just shown a
strong genetic component

00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:43.620
to whatever that trait is.

00:31:43.620 --> 00:31:46.130
That trait-- IQ.

00:31:46.130 --> 00:31:48.310
That trait-- criminal behavior.

00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:50.200
That trait-- alcoholism.

00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:52.970
These were some
very loaded studies,

00:31:52.970 --> 00:31:55.280
in terms of the implications.

00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:58.890
So what is the problem
with that approach?

00:31:58.890 --> 00:32:00.250
A number of problems.

00:32:00.250 --> 00:32:04.310
The first one is that, under
the best of circumstances--

00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:07.370
best of circumstances, best
of circumstances for people

00:32:07.370 --> 00:32:09.140
trying to publish
papers out of this--

00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:11.580
under the cleanest
of circumstances,

00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:14.620
the individuals in the
study were adopted away,

00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:17.960
were taken from the biological
parents, a quarter of a second

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:19.420
after being born.

00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:22.550
No postnatal shared
environment whatsoever.

00:32:22.550 --> 00:32:24.590
What one knows, of
course, is that's not

00:32:24.590 --> 00:32:26.170
the case with adoption.

00:32:26.170 --> 00:32:29.620
And there's varying amounts
of lag time before it occurs.

00:32:29.620 --> 00:32:33.260
And they were never able to
factor that into the analyses.

00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:36.720
OK, so environment-- so
you've got two and a half days

00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:39.320
worth of environment with
your biological parents

00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:40.790
at the beginning there.

00:32:40.790 --> 00:32:43.700
OK, so that's a confound
"give me a break, though."

00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:46.170
Just a couple of days, that's
going to explain differences

00:32:46.170 --> 00:32:47.130
like these?

00:32:47.130 --> 00:32:49.670
What, of course, is
also linking around

00:32:49.670 --> 00:32:53.080
in there is the
huge, whopping topic

00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:59.290
of prenatal affects, prenatal
environment shared with mom.

00:32:59.290 --> 00:33:01.350
And we're about to
see in a little while

00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:04.260
some absolutely
astonishing realms

00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:08.620
in which prenatal environment
has very long-term effects.

00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:10.870
OK, so that's a huge confound.

00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:13.380
So how could you
control for that?

00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:17.530
You see a trait that an
individual shares in common

00:33:17.530 --> 00:33:21.760
with a biological parent,
despite being adopted away

00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:23.670
a second after
birth, all of that.

00:33:23.670 --> 00:33:25.840
And thus, you can infer
there's a biological,

00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:28.310
there's a genetic
component to this trait.

00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:28.820
Uh-oh.

00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:29.412
Wait a second.

00:33:29.412 --> 00:33:30.870
Shared environment
with the mother,

00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:34.000
that may explain some
of the shared traits.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.970
How do you get by that then?

00:33:35.970 --> 00:33:40.430
The difference in the likelihood
of sharing a biological trait,

00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:42.690
a trait with a
biological mother,

00:33:42.690 --> 00:33:46.080
versus a biological
father, is the measure

00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:48.170
then of the prenatal effect.

00:33:48.170 --> 00:33:53.670
If a trait is shared 10% with
the biological father and 17%

00:33:53.670 --> 00:33:56.100
with the biological
mother, the 7%

00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:58.760
is attributable to
prenatal effects.

00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:01.120
That was the general
conclusion that the field

00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:04.780
made at that point for dealing
with this irksome little

00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:08.710
problem, this pesky little thing
of prenatal environment, which

00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:11.270
is going to come back big
time in a few minutes.

00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:13.800
That was how they
were distinguished.

00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:16.639
So some more problems
with that approach.

00:34:16.639 --> 00:34:21.750
One is one that absolutely
tortures behavior geneticists

00:34:21.750 --> 00:34:24.570
the world over, one
which makes them just

00:34:24.570 --> 00:34:27.350
want to have people
being inbred strains

00:34:27.350 --> 00:34:30.929
where they could keep them in
cages and keep track of them.

00:34:30.929 --> 00:34:35.805
The problem being that, often,
the guy saying he's the father

00:34:35.805 --> 00:34:38.370
ain't actually the father.

00:34:38.370 --> 00:34:41.320
Oh, issues of
paternity uncertainty.

00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:43.740
That sure screws up
your genetic studies,

00:34:43.740 --> 00:34:46.239
if you're trying to attribute
stuff to someone who turns out

00:34:46.239 --> 00:34:47.610
not to be related.

00:34:47.610 --> 00:34:51.460
Very much higher rates than
the people at Reader's Digest

00:34:51.460 --> 00:34:54.639
would have you believe, the rate
at which the person claiming

00:34:54.639 --> 00:34:57.710
to be the father is not
actually the biological father.

00:34:57.710 --> 00:34:59.110
OK, that's a bummer.

00:34:59.110 --> 00:35:01.090
That makes things
more complicated.

00:35:01.090 --> 00:35:05.190
One other big confound
in the adoption approach.

00:35:05.190 --> 00:35:07.840
And this was something that
was emphasized by a guy

00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:10.870
at Princeton, Leon Kamin,
a psychologist there,

00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:15.100
doing a very good job of
showing that adoptive family

00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:18.370
placements were non-random.

00:35:18.370 --> 00:35:21.440
When a child is adopted,
you don't sit there

00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:23.570
and close your eyes
and spin the globe

00:35:23.570 --> 00:35:25.510
and put your finger
down in some place,

00:35:25.510 --> 00:35:28.600
and two minutes later this kid
born in, like, Shaker Heights,

00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:31.830
is running around with some
camel herders in Rajasthan.

00:35:31.830 --> 00:35:33.360
This is not done.

00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:35.830
It is not random placement.

00:35:35.830 --> 00:35:40.060
Instead, what is a policy in
virtually every adoptive agency

00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:42.680
in this country
is to try to match

00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:45.640
the kids, as much as
possible, along a number

00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:47.120
of different domains.

00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:52.380
In other words, you are also
sharing a lot of biology

00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:53.980
with the adoptive parents.

00:35:53.980 --> 00:35:57.170
And that completely
screws up the analyses.

00:35:57.170 --> 00:36:00.630
Adoption is non-random,
how it is done.

00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:02.810
One does not just
spin the globe.

00:36:02.810 --> 00:36:06.280
And instead, there are
very intentional attempts

00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:09.750
to try to match for certain
traits, traits which have

00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:12.090
genetic influences on them.

00:36:12.090 --> 00:36:12.780
OK.

00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:14.680
So that's a big problem.

00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:18.110
So the adoptive approach
had tons and tons

00:36:18.110 --> 00:36:20.810
of interesting findings,
enormously influential.

00:36:20.810 --> 00:36:23.990
But over the years, people
have realized, more and more,

00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:27.190
prenatal effects,
paternity uncertainty.

00:36:27.190 --> 00:36:31.070
And from day one, being pointed
out that adoptive parents

00:36:31.070 --> 00:36:36.150
have higher than random rates of
shared genes with the adoptees,

00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:39.000
in most cases, in this country.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:39.710
OK.

00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:41.850
So what becomes
the next approach?

00:36:41.850 --> 00:36:45.690
And this one wound up
being the gold standard,

00:36:45.690 --> 00:36:49.300
the high watermark, of how
to do behavior genetics.

00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:52.810
Behavior geneticists who are
able to do this sort of study,

00:36:52.810 --> 00:36:54.640
the rest of the
behavior geneticists

00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:58.090
hate them, because they've
got the best toys out there

00:36:58.090 --> 00:36:59.060
to play with.

00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:00.951
And they've got the
coolest things going.

00:37:00.951 --> 00:37:02.700
And they're always
snotty, because they've

00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:05.940
got the best possible
circumstance, the most perfect

00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:11.170
thing you can imagine, which
is identical twins separated

00:37:11.170 --> 00:37:13.440
at birth.

00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:14.010
Whoa.

00:37:14.010 --> 00:37:16.430
That must be one hell of an
experiment to have pulled off,

00:37:16.430 --> 00:37:18.440
identical twins
separated at birth.

00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:22.330
It turns out, every now and
then, a pair of identical twins

00:37:22.330 --> 00:37:24.795
are adopted very
soon after birth

00:37:24.795 --> 00:37:28.710
where each one is adopted
into a different household.

00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:30.250
Perfect.

00:37:30.250 --> 00:37:31.230
Perfect.

00:37:31.230 --> 00:37:33.260
Different environments,
different households,

00:37:33.260 --> 00:37:36.790
identical genes, you could
not possibly ask for something

00:37:36.790 --> 00:37:37.960
better than that.

00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:41.150
People, like, wet their pants
when the identical twins

00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:44.400
separated at birth paradigm
burst on the scene.

00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:46.220
This was so wonderful.

00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:48.680
People wrote poems
about identical twins

00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:50.750
separated at birth, sonnets.

00:37:50.750 --> 00:37:51.810
It was the best.

00:37:51.810 --> 00:37:53.980
It was so informative,
because look

00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:55.750
at the power of this approach.

00:37:55.750 --> 00:37:58.560
This is an incredibly
powerful approach.

00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:01.800
The two individuals are raised
in different environments,

00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:05.390
but they've got the
exact same genes.

00:38:05.390 --> 00:38:07.850
So the question
becomes, where are you

00:38:07.850 --> 00:38:10.730
going to find identical
twins separated at birth?

00:38:10.730 --> 00:38:12.960
And there's one obsessive
geneticist, behavior

00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:16.210
geneticist, University of
Minnesota, Tom Bouchard,

00:38:16.210 --> 00:38:19.610
has done an entire career not
only studying these folks,

00:38:19.610 --> 00:38:22.180
but God knows how he
finds these people.

00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:24.330
But he first started
publishing when

00:38:24.330 --> 00:38:27.960
he had 40 pairs of identical
twins separated at birth

00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:30.010
re-united in adulthood.

00:38:30.010 --> 00:38:32.680
And that made for some
incredible, bizarre,

00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:35.060
heartwarming stories
of discovering

00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:39.170
your long-lost identical sibling
and produced a mountain's worth

00:38:39.170 --> 00:38:40.890
of data.

00:38:40.890 --> 00:38:44.270
It was a bizarre
literature from day one.

00:38:44.270 --> 00:38:48.020
First one being, that you would
get the perfect case there.

00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:50.740
And what these guys would be
reporting in the literature

00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:52.760
was totally nutty stuff.

00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:55.680
OK, so you've got one of these
pairs of identical twins.

00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:56.970
And they're born.

00:38:56.970 --> 00:39:03.820
And Wolfie winds up being
raised in Uruguay by neo-Nazis.

00:39:03.820 --> 00:39:07.466
And Shmuel gets raised in
Israel by his highly orthodox

00:39:07.466 --> 00:39:07.965
whatevers.

00:39:07.965 --> 00:39:08.464
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:08.464 --> 00:39:12.880
And then, as a result of
a game show quirk of fate,

00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:14.880
they're suddenly
brought back together.

00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:18.740
And there is Wolfie and Shmuel,
who are identical twins.

00:39:18.740 --> 00:39:20.310
And what do they report?

00:39:20.310 --> 00:39:23.240
The most amazing thing
they have in common,

00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:25.850
they both flush the toilet
both before and after they

00:39:25.850 --> 00:39:26.790
go to the toilet.

00:39:26.790 --> 00:39:27.410
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:27.410 --> 00:39:29.300
You think I'm being facetious.

00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:31.910
Go back to that literature
when that first came out

00:39:31.910 --> 00:39:33.420
and the coverage in the press.

00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:37.710
And it would be things like,
Wolfie and Shmuel, they both

00:39:37.710 --> 00:39:42.660
have, like, a
poodle named Fluffy.

00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:45.760
And the flushing the toilet
before and after going

00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:49.640
to the bathroom, that was one
of the landmark early findings

00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:50.680
of these studies.

00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:52.660
They would find twins
that would do that.

00:39:52.660 --> 00:39:55.590
They would find twins who
were both married to somebody

00:39:55.590 --> 00:39:59.337
named Congolia, or something.

00:39:59.337 --> 00:39:59.836
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:59.836 --> 00:40:02.540
And they'd, oh, my god.

00:40:02.540 --> 00:40:04.300
This is totally amazing.

00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:07.720
That was what hit
the pages, initially,

00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:10.960
these obscure, little,
bizarre similarities

00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:13.370
within a backdrop
of, well, what's

00:40:13.370 --> 00:40:15.080
the data actually showing?

00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:18.690
And what's by now a twin
registry of probably a couple

00:40:18.690 --> 00:40:20.440
of hundreds sets
of these twins--

00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:24.390
and this has become the cottage
industry of the best behavior

00:40:24.390 --> 00:40:27.790
genetics around-- what has
come out of that literature is

00:40:27.790 --> 00:40:32.450
the most solid, reliable
findings is about 50%

00:40:32.450 --> 00:40:35.830
heritability of IQ.

00:40:35.830 --> 00:40:39.480
About 50% heritability
of where you

00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:44.650
are on the introversion,
extroversion scale, and about

00:40:44.650 --> 00:40:49.410
50% heritability for
degree of aggression.

00:40:49.410 --> 00:40:51.290
That's kind of interesting.

00:40:51.290 --> 00:40:54.700
And what we will see is
there's all sorts of problems

00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:56.340
with this approach as well.

00:40:56.340 --> 00:40:58.660
First one being,
starting right off,

00:40:58.660 --> 00:41:01.170
back to that Kamin
guy from Princeton,

00:41:01.170 --> 00:41:02.810
his critique-- turns
out there were not

00:41:02.810 --> 00:41:05.090
a whole lot of
Wolfies and Shmuels.

00:41:05.090 --> 00:41:07.580
Even though they got adopted
into different families,

00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:11.310
there again was the non-random
placement in families,

00:41:11.310 --> 00:41:13.660
more similar environments
than one would have

00:41:13.660 --> 00:41:16.080
anticipated purely by chance.

00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:18.130
So that is a confound.

00:41:18.130 --> 00:41:20.710
OK, so what's the
solution for that one?

00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:21.510
I know.

00:41:21.510 --> 00:41:24.760
Let's look at monozygotic
twins separated at birth

00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:27.910
and reunited on Oprah
at age 50, and then

00:41:27.910 --> 00:41:30.720
look at dizygotic twins
separated at birth

00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:33.390
and reunited after the
commercial break on Oprah,

00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:35.530
and see what similarities are.

00:41:35.530 --> 00:41:39.440
And if you see more things in
common with the monozygotics,

00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:41.010
rather than the
dizygotics, you've

00:41:41.010 --> 00:41:44.020
just controlled for the
non-random placement

00:41:44.020 --> 00:41:45.520
in the adoptive homes.

00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:47.710
The extent to which
the monozygotics

00:41:47.710 --> 00:41:51.900
have traits more in common
than the dizygotics, that

00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:53.990
reflects the identical genes.

00:41:53.990 --> 00:41:55.840
That was the interpretation.

00:41:55.840 --> 00:41:59.370
That was a very powerful
sort of analysis,

00:41:59.370 --> 00:42:02.890
one that, nonetheless,
winds up being very limited.

00:42:02.890 --> 00:42:06.270
Because in this case,
because of tiny sample size,

00:42:06.270 --> 00:42:09.480
it's really hard to
have done those studies.

00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:12.340
What's another feature of
the whole behavior genetics

00:42:12.340 --> 00:42:13.170
approach?

00:42:13.170 --> 00:42:14.340
Here's another one.

00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:18.110
If you see traits that
occur, behavioral traits,

00:42:18.110 --> 00:42:21.910
in the absence of any
learning, in the absence

00:42:21.910 --> 00:42:26.700
of any environmental experience,
in the absence of anything that

00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:31.170
can count as being
non-genetic, if you see that,

00:42:31.170 --> 00:42:33.440
you're looking at a
genetic influence.

00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:36.150
And what are the examples
that are always given?

00:42:36.150 --> 00:42:39.430
The fact that all babies
all over the universe

00:42:39.430 --> 00:42:43.450
start smiling, and they use
the exact same set of muscles.

00:42:43.450 --> 00:42:46.190
And they always start smiling
socially around, roughly,

00:42:46.190 --> 00:42:47.470
the same age.

00:42:47.470 --> 00:42:50.450
And what you also
see-- I don't want

00:42:50.450 --> 00:42:53.820
to know how these were done--
but these classic photographs

00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:57.580
that you can get filming
of kids in utero--

00:42:57.580 --> 00:43:00.690
I don't know what fiber
optic something or other

00:43:00.690 --> 00:43:02.920
was doing that-- but
the demonstration

00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:04.740
that fetuses smile.

00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:07.220
Fetuses smile during
the third trimester.

00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:11.590
This is a motoric pattern that
is shared among all humans.

00:43:11.590 --> 00:43:12.090
OK.

00:43:12.090 --> 00:43:16.460
Well, social smiling,
you see the flaw there,

00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:20.680
which is that is very subject
to shaping of behavior.

00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:22.660
You are three months
old, and you're

00:43:22.660 --> 00:43:25.880
watching all this social smiling
going on around you, and how

00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:28.410
the mannequins they have
at home are nowhere near as

00:43:28.410 --> 00:43:30.700
interesting as the
animated faces there.

00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:32.520
And you sort of try
it out yourself.

00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:36.090
What you see it's the exact
same developmental time

00:43:36.090 --> 00:43:40.560
course for smiling among
congenitally blind babies,

00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:43.640
babies who never
see anybody smiling.

00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:46.500
So you see the
motor pattern here

00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:51.010
being something that is
arguably fairly universal

00:43:51.010 --> 00:43:54.280
and occurring in the absence
of any sort of training,

00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:56.180
how you go about smiling.

00:43:56.180 --> 00:43:58.140
The other example
that's always used

00:43:58.140 --> 00:44:00.910
is with congenitally
deaf babies.

00:44:00.910 --> 00:44:04.720
And what you get there is
another universal, which

00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:08.180
is beginning to babble
at the exact same age

00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:10.540
that hearing kids
begin to babble,

00:44:10.540 --> 00:44:13.670
and the same argument
being made there.

00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:18.560
Of course, you have a very
uphill task there of ruling out

00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:20.770
any environmental similarities.

00:44:20.770 --> 00:44:23.640
Because once again,
once again, an area

00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:25.990
that has been utterly
under-appreciated

00:44:25.990 --> 00:44:28.190
in this whole field
is the whole world

00:44:28.190 --> 00:44:31.050
of prenatal
environmental effects.

00:44:31.050 --> 00:44:34.570
And the theme that's going to
come out of that is environment

00:44:34.570 --> 00:44:36.280
does not begin at birth.

00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:39.120
And some environmental
effects prenatally

00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:42.800
are enormously
influential forever after.

00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:45.520
And if you showed up
on the scene one second

00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:48.100
after that individual
was born, all

00:44:48.100 --> 00:44:50.550
of the tools of modern
behavior genetics

00:44:50.550 --> 00:44:52.070
would tell you that
you were looking

00:44:52.070 --> 00:44:54.650
at a genetic trait,
where it is one instead

00:44:54.650 --> 00:44:57.640
that was brought about by
the prenatal environment.

00:44:57.640 --> 00:44:59.200
OK, let's take a
five-minute break,

00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:01.710
and then we will
pick up on that.

00:45:01.710 --> 00:45:02.390
--good ones.

00:45:02.390 --> 00:45:04.860
First one being going back
to that gender difference

00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:07.910
business, the assumption
running through the field

00:45:07.910 --> 00:45:11.770
that, OK, boys and girls are
raised in the same environment

00:45:11.770 --> 00:45:12.770
by their parents.

00:45:12.770 --> 00:45:15.480
And the only thing that
differs is the genes.

00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:18.070
Like even those people,
behavior geneticists,

00:45:18.070 --> 00:45:19.700
believe that could be the case.

00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:22.900
No, they recognized this
was a very limited approach,

00:45:22.900 --> 00:45:25.280
and thus would limit
themselves to circumstances

00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:28.580
like the first hour of
post-natal life, which

00:45:28.580 --> 00:45:30.880
we already saw is a
flawed assumption,

00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:33.560
or under circumstances
where everybody's

00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:36.870
had the same number
of math problems

00:45:36.870 --> 00:45:39.620
to take in their first
12 years of life.

00:45:39.620 --> 00:45:41.290
And we see the
problem with that.

00:45:41.290 --> 00:45:43.040
Nonetheless, there
was the recognition

00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:45.510
that that was a very
limited set of tools

00:45:45.510 --> 00:45:46.790
for getting at these issues.

00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:48.670
The other useful thing
that was brought up

00:45:48.670 --> 00:45:52.340
was somebody pointing out
that, in the extended notes

00:45:52.340 --> 00:45:56.702
for behavior genetics, in the
second paragraph, somewhere

00:45:56.702 --> 00:45:58.410
in there, about the
fourth or fifth line,

00:45:58.410 --> 00:46:02.520
is the very clearly
typed out word, "unable."

00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:05.480
And pointing out that,
actually, the word

00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:06.750
was supposed to be "able."

00:46:06.750 --> 00:46:08.750
So you might want to
take a look at that

00:46:08.750 --> 00:46:11.060
and kind of keep
that one in mind.

00:46:11.060 --> 00:46:13.150
OK, perhaps I should
take a look at it also.

00:46:13.150 --> 00:46:13.920
Moving on.

00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:17.170
Moving on now to this
business, all of the approaches

00:46:17.170 --> 00:46:18.880
we've been seeing
about comparing

00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:20.520
monozygotic with dizygotic.

00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:24.130
By the way, with the
identical twins, 2/3 of them

00:46:24.130 --> 00:46:25.700
have monochorionic.

00:46:25.700 --> 00:46:28.070
1/3 are split.

00:46:28.070 --> 00:46:31.030
And how many of you who are
identical twins absolutely

00:46:31.030 --> 00:46:33.380
know in your heart of
heart right now whether you

00:46:33.380 --> 00:46:38.310
were a monochorionic
or bichorionic twin?

00:46:38.310 --> 00:46:38.830
OK.

00:46:38.830 --> 00:46:41.200
Well, that didn't
work very well.

00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:42.150
OK.

00:46:42.150 --> 00:46:43.730
So pushing on.

00:46:43.730 --> 00:46:46.650
What we see here is, with
all of these approaches,

00:46:46.650 --> 00:46:50.120
the adoption, the twins
separated at birth,

00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:52.830
the twins, mono versus
dizygotic, et cetera,

00:46:52.830 --> 00:46:55.100
et cetera, all of
those were predicated

00:46:55.100 --> 00:46:57.650
on one simple
assumption, which is,

00:46:57.650 --> 00:47:00.230
environment begins at birth.

00:47:00.230 --> 00:47:03.030
And that has been
completely destroyed

00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:06.920
in some incredibly interesting
ways in recent years.

00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:09.700
We have very vibrant
literature at this point.

00:47:09.700 --> 00:47:12.050
First way that it
can go down, which

00:47:12.050 --> 00:47:14.110
is your prenatal environment.

00:47:14.110 --> 00:47:16.750
What are you having as
a prenatal environment?

00:47:16.750 --> 00:47:18.920
Who are you sharing
environment with?

00:47:18.920 --> 00:47:20.730
Obviously, with your mother.

00:47:20.730 --> 00:47:22.620
You are sharing blood.

00:47:22.620 --> 00:47:25.780
You are sharing blood,
and thus the things

00:47:25.780 --> 00:47:29.320
that she is experiencing in
the world around her that

00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:32.410
make for a different environment
than the person standing

00:47:32.410 --> 00:47:36.610
next to her gets translated
into effects on the fetus.

00:47:36.610 --> 00:47:39.670
First domain, hormonal ones.

00:47:39.670 --> 00:47:43.790
Here's one example of something
that you will wind up seeing.

00:47:43.790 --> 00:47:46.720
This was worked on by a
guy named, Fred Vom Saal,

00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:49.800
at University of Missouri.

00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:52.070
And what he did was
look at the fact

00:47:52.070 --> 00:47:55.350
that rats give birth to
litters of about a dozen kids

00:47:55.350 --> 00:47:56.230
at a time.

00:47:56.230 --> 00:47:59.440
And there's some
circulatory system thing.

00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:03.060
They look like a whole
necklace of fetuses there.

00:48:03.060 --> 00:48:05.620
And the circulatory
system is such

00:48:05.620 --> 00:48:07.900
that everybody's getting
blood, but you're

00:48:07.900 --> 00:48:10.650
getting preferentially
the blood that

00:48:10.650 --> 00:48:13.150
is from the siblings
right around you.

00:48:13.150 --> 00:48:14.910
There's some sort
of looping thing

00:48:14.910 --> 00:48:17.340
that occurs with the blood
system that looks just

00:48:17.340 --> 00:48:17.980
like that.

00:48:17.980 --> 00:48:22.070
And what you wind up getting is
you have a particularly shared

00:48:22.070 --> 00:48:25.960
blood environment with the
siblings on either side of you.

00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:28.230
And what he asked was
something very simple.

00:48:28.230 --> 00:48:30.830
You are a female rat fetus.

00:48:30.830 --> 00:48:33.280
And in one case,
you're sitting there

00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:36.360
with brothers on each side.

00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:38.940
In another case,
one brother and one

00:48:38.940 --> 00:48:42.810
sister, or in the final case,
obviously, with two sisters

00:48:42.810 --> 00:48:43.800
on either side.

00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:46.670
And what you wind up getting
is a different hormonal

00:48:46.670 --> 00:48:47.680
environment.

00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:49.830
How does that
translate out later?

00:48:49.830 --> 00:48:53.590
The more male siblings you
have around you as a fetus,

00:48:53.590 --> 00:48:56.350
the later you're going
to reach puberty.

00:48:56.350 --> 00:49:01.010
That's interesting, suggesting
that very local endocrine

00:49:01.010 --> 00:49:04.380
effects here play out
in something like that.

00:49:04.380 --> 00:49:07.610
Also, it predicts how
estrogen levels are going

00:49:07.610 --> 00:49:09.630
to drop in you later in life.

00:49:09.630 --> 00:49:12.620
So this winds up being
one very interesting

00:49:12.620 --> 00:49:14.460
prenatal environment.

00:49:14.460 --> 00:49:15.860
Here's another one.

00:49:15.860 --> 00:49:20.690
Here we have, in humans,
the age of one's mother

00:49:20.690 --> 00:49:24.270
when she gave birth-- and
extrapolating a little bit here

00:49:24.270 --> 00:49:27.690
at both ends, but just assume
this is kind of the age range.

00:49:27.690 --> 00:49:31.540
And what we see here is
the age of puberty onset

00:49:31.540 --> 00:49:33.050
in the offspring.

00:49:33.050 --> 00:49:37.510
And what is seen is very young
mothers and very old mothers

00:49:37.510 --> 00:49:41.350
have offspring who reach
puberty later than women

00:49:41.350 --> 00:49:43.400
in a more intermediate age.

00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:45.650
What does that
appear to be due to?

00:49:45.650 --> 00:49:47.730
Differing estrogen levels.

00:49:47.730 --> 00:49:50.930
Higher levels of estrogen
at this point in life--

00:49:50.930 --> 00:49:52.290
it's actually not symmetrical.

00:49:52.290 --> 00:49:54.080
It's skewed a little
bit this way--

00:49:54.080 --> 00:49:57.101
and that seems to be
the driving force on it.

00:49:57.101 --> 00:49:57.600
Whoa.

00:49:57.600 --> 00:50:00.110
The age at which
you reach puberty

00:50:00.110 --> 00:50:04.570
has to do with how old the
fetal sack was that you hung out

00:50:04.570 --> 00:50:05.760
for nine months?

00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:07.400
That has an influence?

00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:08.480
Absolutely.

00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:10.690
So prenatal effects.

00:50:10.690 --> 00:50:11.300
More.

00:50:11.300 --> 00:50:12.870
Another version of it.

00:50:12.870 --> 00:50:15.090
Suppose now the
hormone you're getting

00:50:15.090 --> 00:50:16.740
inundated with through
the bloodstream

00:50:16.740 --> 00:50:18.810
is a stress hormone.

00:50:18.810 --> 00:50:21.140
A stress hormone--
glucocorticoids,

00:50:21.140 --> 00:50:23.710
we will learn all about
those down the line--

00:50:23.710 --> 00:50:26.740
a stress hormone,
because mom is stressed.

00:50:26.740 --> 00:50:29.250
What are some of
the consequences?

00:50:29.250 --> 00:50:32.350
For the same prenatal
stress, as an adult,

00:50:32.350 --> 00:50:35.930
you will have a smaller
brain-- if you're a rat.

00:50:35.930 --> 00:50:38.180
You will have a thinner cortex.

00:50:38.180 --> 00:50:40.220
You will have less
learning abilities.

00:50:40.220 --> 00:50:42.470
You will be more
prone towards anxiety.

00:50:42.470 --> 00:50:46.180
You will have fewer of those
benzodiazepine receptors

00:50:46.180 --> 00:50:48.170
that we heard about
the other day.

00:50:48.170 --> 00:50:50.260
You will have more of
a cognitive decline

00:50:50.260 --> 00:50:52.230
when you are a
doddering old rat.

00:50:52.230 --> 00:50:54.840
All sorts of stuff
will go differently

00:50:54.840 --> 00:50:57.060
throughout your entire life.

00:50:57.060 --> 00:50:58.520
But get this.

00:50:58.520 --> 00:51:00.710
OK, look at this mechanism.

00:51:00.710 --> 00:51:02.390
So you are a rat.

00:51:02.390 --> 00:51:04.230
And your mother
was stressed when

00:51:04.230 --> 00:51:05.770
you were a fetus back when.

00:51:05.770 --> 00:51:08.180
And you were marinated
in those glucocorticoids

00:51:08.180 --> 00:51:09.570
when you were a fetus.

00:51:09.570 --> 00:51:12.980
Your brain, overall,
will be smaller.

00:51:12.980 --> 00:51:15.081
There's one particular
brain region,

00:51:15.081 --> 00:51:17.080
which I won't mention
right now because it's not

00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:19.110
really critical,
there's one brain region

00:51:19.110 --> 00:51:21.300
that's particularly hard hit.

00:51:21.300 --> 00:51:23.810
What does that brain region do?

00:51:23.810 --> 00:51:30.730
Among other things, it helps to
turn off the stress response.

00:51:30.730 --> 00:51:34.340
So if that part of
the brain is smaller,

00:51:34.340 --> 00:51:38.850
you're not as good at blocking
glucocorticoid secretion

00:51:38.850 --> 00:51:40.890
at the end of stress.

00:51:40.890 --> 00:51:43.980
And somebody with a normal-sized
whatever, something stressful

00:51:43.980 --> 00:51:45.550
occurs, and they recover.

00:51:45.550 --> 00:51:49.240
And you do this instead.

00:51:49.240 --> 00:51:52.610
Because this mysterious part
of the brain is smaller,

00:51:52.610 --> 00:51:56.200
is not giving as much of a
negative feedback signal.

00:51:56.200 --> 00:51:58.430
And for people new to
endocrinology, that's something

00:51:58.430 --> 00:52:00.010
you'll be getting
in a couple weeks.

00:52:00.010 --> 00:52:03.630
The net result is, if this
part of the brain is smaller,

00:52:03.630 --> 00:52:09.410
you will have more lifetime
exposure to glucocorticoids.

00:52:09.410 --> 00:52:11.340
So what happens next?

00:52:11.340 --> 00:52:14.970
What happens next, in
addition, baseline is also

00:52:14.970 --> 00:52:17.050
elevated in these individuals.

00:52:17.050 --> 00:52:21.510
So the net result is a lot
more cumulative exposure.

00:52:21.510 --> 00:52:23.630
So you are a female rat.

00:52:23.630 --> 00:52:27.160
And you were in a mother
who was stressed prenatally

00:52:27.160 --> 00:52:28.160
when you were a fetus.

00:52:28.160 --> 00:52:31.220
And as a result, in addition
to all the other problems

00:52:31.220 --> 00:52:34.210
that you've got lifelong,
you secrete higher

00:52:34.210 --> 00:52:36.600
than expected
glucocorticoid levels.

00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:39.350
And eventually,
you get pregnant.

00:52:39.350 --> 00:52:42.300
And thus, your fetus
is going to be exposed

00:52:42.300 --> 00:52:44.320
to elevated
glucocorticoid levels

00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:48.330
and will be born with a
somewhat smaller brain, thinner

00:52:48.330 --> 00:52:50.250
cortex, et cetera, et cetera.

00:52:50.250 --> 00:52:52.150
What have we just shown?

00:52:52.150 --> 00:52:55.890
An environmental manipulation
on a pregnant female

00:52:55.890 --> 00:52:59.190
manifesting itself
two generations later

00:52:59.190 --> 00:53:00.760
in the grandchildren.

00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:03.200
And when this was first
described in the early '60s,

00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:05.590
this was called the
grandmother effect.

00:53:05.590 --> 00:53:08.180
And eventually, it
was shown to go out

00:53:08.180 --> 00:53:09.870
about four or five generations.

00:53:09.870 --> 00:53:12.310
The magnitude the
effect would get smaller

00:53:12.310 --> 00:53:14.520
with each generation,
before it disappeared.

00:53:14.520 --> 00:53:16.580
But look at what this is about.

00:53:16.580 --> 00:53:20.500
This is inheriting a
trait that is not genetic.

00:53:20.500 --> 00:53:23.590
And this wound up being the
first example of what is now

00:53:23.590 --> 00:53:27.020
called, non-Mendelian
inheritance

00:53:27.020 --> 00:53:31.270
of traits, non-genetic
inheritance of traits.

00:53:31.270 --> 00:53:35.220
And all you've got going
here is prenatal environment.

00:53:35.220 --> 00:53:38.140
Extremely powerful observation.

00:53:38.140 --> 00:53:41.680
And what you also then have
is, your some researcher,

00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:44.320
and again, you come
along one second

00:53:44.320 --> 00:53:47.360
after the animal is born.

00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:49.700
And you wind up studying,
saying oh, look at this.

00:53:49.700 --> 00:53:53.160
This rat tends to have elevated
glucocorticoid levels, just

00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:53.820
like mom.

00:53:53.820 --> 00:53:56.880
And this rat tends to have a
thinner cortex, just like mom.

00:53:56.880 --> 00:53:58.480
And this rat-- and
if you've never

00:53:58.480 --> 00:54:01.060
heard of prenatal
environmental effects, what's

00:54:01.060 --> 00:54:02.990
the only conclusion
you could make?

00:54:02.990 --> 00:54:06.210
There are genetic
influences on these traits.

00:54:06.210 --> 00:54:09.990
So these non-Mendelian,
non-genetic transmission

00:54:09.990 --> 00:54:13.500
of traits are really,
really important.

00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:14.280
Next thing.

00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:16.730
What else is floating around
in mom's bloodstream that

00:54:16.730 --> 00:54:18.540
gets shared, besides hormones?

00:54:18.540 --> 00:54:19.970
Nutrients.

00:54:19.970 --> 00:54:20.770
Nutrients.

00:54:20.770 --> 00:54:23.800
And this winds up producing
something extremely interesting

00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:24.530
as well.

00:54:24.530 --> 00:54:25.990
OK, it's all a blur by now.

00:54:25.990 --> 00:54:28.460
Have we already talked
about Dutch Hunger Winter?

00:54:28.460 --> 00:54:31.060
It was in the video we
watched while you were gone.

00:54:31.060 --> 00:54:33.793
Oh.

00:54:33.793 --> 00:54:35.198
[BLOWS RASPBERRY] OK.

00:54:35.198 --> 00:54:36.870
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:36.870 --> 00:54:40.067
Well, now that you all know
about-- what did I say?

00:54:40.067 --> 00:54:41.650
That was only like
100 people, though.

00:54:41.650 --> 00:54:42.520
OK.

00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:45.770
OK, for those of you who
didn't-- Dutch Hunger Winter,

00:54:45.770 --> 00:54:47.720
here's the deal.

00:54:47.720 --> 00:54:52.660
If you were a fetus in Holland
during the winter of 1944,

00:54:52.660 --> 00:54:54.870
something very interesting
happened with you.

00:54:54.870 --> 00:54:58.130
1944, Holland is still
occupied by the Nazis.

00:54:58.130 --> 00:55:00.420
Nazis are being
pressured on all fronts.

00:55:00.420 --> 00:55:03.360
In the process of losing,
they're falling back.

00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:05.980
They're losing a lot of
the land they've occupied.

00:55:05.980 --> 00:55:08.080
And what they decide
to do that winter

00:55:08.080 --> 00:55:11.070
is, because they need some
food and because they wanted

00:55:11.070 --> 00:55:14.000
to punish the Dutch for
beginning to be more openly

00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:16.290
in the resistance, what
they did was, that winter,

00:55:16.290 --> 00:55:19.990
they diverted all of the
food in Holland to Germany.

00:55:19.990 --> 00:55:23.320
And historically known as
the Dutch Hunger Winter.

00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:27.080
Essentially, people went
from a perfectly fine,

00:55:27.080 --> 00:55:29.940
healthy-- amid the
context of a war--

00:55:29.940 --> 00:55:32.520
Western-European diet,
down to something

00:55:32.520 --> 00:55:34.520
like that from out of nowhere.

00:55:34.520 --> 00:55:38.290
40,000 people starved to death
during the Dutch Hunger Winter.

00:55:38.290 --> 00:55:40.950
Something very
interesting occurred,

00:55:40.950 --> 00:55:45.070
if you were a third-trimester
fetus, during the Dutch Hunger

00:55:45.070 --> 00:55:47.680
Winter, because it only
lasted for the winter.

00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:51.020
The Allies came in,
liberated Holland after that.

00:55:51.020 --> 00:55:53.520
And it went to something
like this, something

00:55:53.520 --> 00:55:56.340
resembling a step
function of starvation

00:55:56.340 --> 00:55:58.440
for about three months.

00:55:58.440 --> 00:56:01.940
If you were third-trimester
fetus during the Dutch Hunger

00:56:01.940 --> 00:56:05.790
Winter, your body learned
something important,

00:56:05.790 --> 00:56:09.380
which is here is not a whole
lot of calories out there.

00:56:09.380 --> 00:56:12.840
During third trimester,
fetuses are in some way--

00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:17.620
and this is metaphorical--
deciding, learning how much,

00:56:17.620 --> 00:56:19.450
in the way of
nutrients out there

00:56:19.450 --> 00:56:22.440
in the world, how readily
do calories come in?

00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:24.220
How is the fetus finding out?

00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:26.350
By way of mom's circulation.

00:56:26.350 --> 00:56:27.720
Mom is starving.

00:56:27.720 --> 00:56:30.850
And thus, much lower levels of
nutrients in the bloodstream.

00:56:30.850 --> 00:56:33.720
And the fetus, at that
point in development,

00:56:33.720 --> 00:56:36.170
is saying, metaphorically,
well, what's

00:56:36.170 --> 00:56:38.220
it like out there in
this place I'm going

00:56:38.220 --> 00:56:39.890
to be heading to rather soon?

00:56:39.890 --> 00:56:42.490
What's the nutritional
profile like?

00:56:42.490 --> 00:56:45.760
There's not much in the
way of food out there.

00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:49.760
And as a result, the fetus
has-- and the term used now

00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:52.110
is "metabolic programming."

00:56:52.110 --> 00:56:56.380
There is metabolic programming,
or metabolic imprinting--

00:56:56.380 --> 00:56:58.110
notice the word
"imprinting" here being

00:56:58.110 --> 00:56:59.960
used in a completely
different sense

00:56:59.960 --> 00:57:03.250
than we've heard about
already-- metabolic programming

00:57:03.250 --> 00:57:07.950
to produce what is called
a thrifty phenotype.

00:57:07.950 --> 00:57:11.030
The fetus, realizing
there is nothing out there

00:57:11.030 --> 00:57:13.440
in the way of plentiful
food, what it does

00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:16.810
is it programs its
pancreas to function in

00:57:16.810 --> 00:57:18.810
a certain way forever after.

00:57:18.810 --> 00:57:20.500
What does the pancreas do?

00:57:20.500 --> 00:57:24.010
The smallest smidgen of
food hits the bloodstream,

00:57:24.010 --> 00:57:26.690
and the pancreas is
pumping out insulin,

00:57:26.690 --> 00:57:29.970
which helps store all that
stuff and quickly scarf up

00:57:29.970 --> 00:57:32.250
every bit of nutrient
in the bloodstream

00:57:32.250 --> 00:57:34.150
and store it away,
because you've got

00:57:34.150 --> 00:57:36.440
to be as efficient as possible.

00:57:36.440 --> 00:57:39.930
And you've metabolically
programmed your kidneys,

00:57:39.930 --> 00:57:42.960
so that your kidneys are
incredibly good at retaining

00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:45.060
salt. Because along
with starvation,

00:57:45.060 --> 00:57:46.710
there's going to
be salt shortages.

00:57:46.710 --> 00:57:49.780
So really hold on to salt.
And you are born with a body

00:57:49.780 --> 00:57:54.770
with a thrifty metabolism,
very good at retaining salt,

00:57:54.770 --> 00:57:58.590
and spectacular at storing
away every bit of nutrients

00:57:58.590 --> 00:58:00.560
that hits the bloodstream.

00:58:00.560 --> 00:58:04.450
So at that point, you go
back to this sort of diet.

00:58:04.450 --> 00:58:06.320
And you have that for
the rest of your life.

00:58:06.320 --> 00:58:09.270
And what has now been shown
with the Dutch Hunger Winter

00:58:09.270 --> 00:58:13.260
individuals, the ones who were
third-trimester fetuses then,

00:58:13.260 --> 00:58:17.850
as adults, they have a
19-fold increased incidence

00:58:17.850 --> 00:58:22.520
of obesity, hypertension,
diabetes, and what's

00:58:22.520 --> 00:58:25.580
called metabolic syndrome.

00:58:25.580 --> 00:58:26.990
What's that about?

00:58:26.990 --> 00:58:30.090
Their body has programmed
to be extremely

00:58:30.090 --> 00:58:31.720
thrifty with metabolism.

00:58:31.720 --> 00:58:34.620
And as such, it is
forever after storing

00:58:34.620 --> 00:58:37.970
away every of the
grotesque Westernized diets

00:58:37.970 --> 00:58:39.610
that we all wallow in.

00:58:39.610 --> 00:58:43.150
And what you've got then
is setting individuals

00:58:43.150 --> 00:58:48.610
up for a much, much higher risk
of these metabolic disorders.

00:58:48.610 --> 00:58:52.150
If you were a newborn at
the time, it didn't happen.

00:58:52.150 --> 00:58:54.180
A newborn during
here, the metabolic

00:58:54.180 --> 00:58:55.850
programming is
already over by then.

00:58:55.850 --> 00:58:59.130
If you were a first-trimester
fetus, didn't happen.

00:58:59.130 --> 00:59:01.500
The metabolic programming
hasn't started yet.

00:59:01.500 --> 00:59:04.960
Second, the later part or
second to third trimester

00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:07.600
is when the programming goes on.

00:59:07.600 --> 00:59:10.430
And this was a
landmark observation.

00:59:10.430 --> 00:59:11.980
This was really important.

00:59:11.980 --> 00:59:13.880
Among other things,
you get the people

00:59:13.880 --> 00:59:16.850
who do not like the notion
of these subtle effects.

00:59:16.850 --> 00:59:18.310
And they're saying, OK, sure.

00:59:18.310 --> 00:59:20.520
This can happen,
but this is subtle.

00:59:20.520 --> 00:59:22.980
19-fold is not subtle.

00:59:22.980 --> 00:59:25.930
And this was the
landmark study that

00:59:25.930 --> 00:59:30.800
ushered in what is now called
a whole field of fetal origins

00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:33.080
of adult disease.

00:59:33.080 --> 00:59:35.200
Fetal origins of
adult disease, which

00:59:35.200 --> 00:59:37.850
a lot of realms
of medicine think

00:59:37.850 --> 00:59:40.820
is outrageous and couldn't
possibly work this way.

00:59:40.820 --> 00:59:44.030
And it is popping up in
more and more domains.

00:59:44.030 --> 00:59:47.360
Elevated levels of stress
hormones during fetal life,

00:59:47.360 --> 00:59:50.040
increased likelihood
of anxiety disorders

00:59:50.040 --> 00:59:53.470
as an adult, independent
of post-natal environment.

00:59:53.470 --> 00:59:58.030
Other examples like that, all of
these being ones of programming

00:59:58.030 --> 00:59:59.780
around that time.

00:59:59.780 --> 01:00:03.990
And the Dutch Hunger Winter
one is the iconic example.

01:00:03.990 --> 01:00:06.790
You know, what we're all
accustomed to is yeah,

01:00:06.790 --> 01:00:09.609
you study something
in, like, a planaria.

01:00:09.609 --> 01:00:10.900
And then you study it in a rat.

01:00:10.900 --> 01:00:12.108
And you study it in a monkey.

01:00:12.108 --> 01:00:14.100
And then you study it
in a college freshman.

01:00:14.100 --> 01:00:17.160
And finally, when it's-- now,
you can conclude something

01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:18.860
maybe, maybe about humans.

01:00:18.860 --> 01:00:22.620
This was first discovered in
this population of humans.

01:00:22.620 --> 01:00:25.400
This was no, is this
relevant to humans.

01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:28.220
Interestingly, there
was another population

01:00:28.220 --> 01:00:30.430
at the time that went
through something or other

01:00:30.430 --> 01:00:34.170
like that, which was people
in the city of Stalingrad

01:00:34.170 --> 01:00:36.260
who were under
siege by the Nazis

01:00:36.260 --> 01:00:40.050
and had essentially years
worth of severe starvation.

01:00:40.050 --> 01:00:43.190
They didn't get a Dutch
Hunger Winter phenomenon,

01:00:43.190 --> 01:00:46.360
because the food
coasted off like this.

01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:48.400
And afterward, it
took years for it

01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:50.720
to reach a
Western-European average.

01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:53.070
You don't get it under
those circumstances.

01:00:53.070 --> 01:00:55.960
It's a step function like this.

01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:56.460
OK.

01:00:56.460 --> 01:00:57.910
So think about this now.

01:00:57.910 --> 01:01:00.520
So you were a Dutch
Hunger Winter fetus.

01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:03.400
And as a result, you have
a very thrifty metabolism.

01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:07.370
And 30 years later,
you've gotten pregnant.

01:01:07.370 --> 01:01:09.780
You're having a
perfectly normal diet,

01:01:09.780 --> 01:01:11.690
normal intake of calories.

01:01:11.690 --> 01:01:14.250
But you've got this
thrifty metabolism.

01:01:14.250 --> 01:01:17.510
And as a result,
your body is really

01:01:17.510 --> 01:01:20.480
good at pulling nutrients
out of the bloodstream,

01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:24.310
because you secrete more
insulin than most people would.

01:01:24.310 --> 01:01:26.940
With your thrifty
metabolism, you

01:01:26.940 --> 01:01:30.600
are pulling a disproportionate
share of the calories out

01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:31.590
of the bloodstream.

01:01:31.590 --> 01:01:36.230
And thus, your fetus is getting
a disproportionately smaller

01:01:36.230 --> 01:01:37.800
amount of calories.

01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:41.570
And thus, your fetus is
born with a milder version

01:01:41.570 --> 01:01:44.600
of the Dutch Hunger
Winter phenomenon.

01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:47.510
And this has now been
shown in the grandchildren

01:01:47.510 --> 01:01:49.580
of Dutch Hunger Winter fetuses.

01:01:49.580 --> 01:01:51.920
This is that exact same deal.

01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:55.940
This is non-Mendelian,
non-genetic transmission

01:01:55.940 --> 01:01:58.740
of traits, multigenerationally.

01:01:58.740 --> 01:02:01.510
Absolutely astonishing
that this could work.

01:02:01.510 --> 01:02:04.250
And the biology is
all in place for it.

01:02:04.250 --> 01:02:07.580
What we will see in a little
while is what the mechanism is,

01:02:07.580 --> 01:02:11.170
and it's been identified down
to the molecular level of what

01:02:11.170 --> 01:02:14.700
went on in these Dutch Hunger
Winter-- OK, I'll give it away.

01:02:14.700 --> 01:02:18.110
Remember that epigenetic
business the other day?

01:02:18.110 --> 01:02:22.030
There are epigenetic
changes in the gene's coding

01:02:22.030 --> 01:02:27.370
for things related to insulin in
the Dutch Hunger Winter babies.

01:02:27.370 --> 01:02:29.440
So enormous effect.

01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:32.650
Another example of it,
another dietary one,

01:02:32.650 --> 01:02:35.660
which is, if you are
female-- and female human,

01:02:35.660 --> 01:02:38.540
among other species, this
has been shown in-- there's

01:02:38.540 --> 01:02:42.320
an issue of how much estrogen
does your mother consume

01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:43.950
when you were a fetus.

01:02:43.950 --> 01:02:46.950
Where's estrogen coming
from in the diet?

01:02:46.950 --> 01:02:51.220
From a lot of different types
of plants, phytoestrogens.

01:02:51.220 --> 01:02:54.990
And what the studies show
is that increased exposure

01:02:54.990 --> 01:02:57.580
to estrogen derived
from phytoestrogens

01:02:57.580 --> 01:03:01.230
during fetal life, and there
is a small but consistent

01:03:01.230 --> 01:03:03.650
increased risk of
estrogen-dependent breast

01:03:03.650 --> 01:03:07.910
cancer, 20 years
later, 90 years later.

01:03:07.910 --> 01:03:12.020
Again, very subtle prenatal
environmental effects

01:03:12.020 --> 01:03:17.170
playing out forever, even unto
the generations after you.

01:03:17.170 --> 01:03:20.770
Another realm of prenatal
effects, learning.

01:03:20.770 --> 01:03:23.500
OK, this sounds ludicrous
right off the bat,

01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:26.210
that you can have
learning prenatally.

01:03:26.210 --> 01:03:27.960
You have learning prenatally.

01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:30.790
You can show this first in rats.

01:03:30.790 --> 01:03:32.040
Here's what you do.

01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:36.780
You take a rat fetus, and
you can inject into it

01:03:36.780 --> 01:03:41.260
a particular flavor of
water along with sucrose.

01:03:41.260 --> 01:03:43.220
And the fetus absorbs it.

01:03:43.220 --> 01:03:46.050
The fetus actually drinks
amniotic fluid, which

01:03:46.050 --> 01:03:47.770
I find to be deeply creepy.

01:03:47.770 --> 01:03:50.140
But nonetheless, you
inject this stuff in there.

01:03:50.140 --> 01:03:52.340
And you are doing this a
number of days running.

01:03:52.340 --> 01:03:55.440
And this fetus is now
drinking this flavor that

01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:57.970
has a lot of sucrose in it.

01:03:57.970 --> 01:03:59.450
It tastes good.

01:03:59.450 --> 01:04:00.100
It tastes good?

01:04:00.100 --> 01:04:00.870
You're a fetus.

01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:02.700
What do you mean,
it tastes good?

01:04:02.700 --> 01:04:04.660
The fetus learns about it.

01:04:04.660 --> 01:04:06.960
Because after birth,
given a choice

01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:09.770
between two neutral
flavors, it will

01:04:09.770 --> 01:04:12.740
prefer the flavor it was
exposed to that it was

01:04:12.740 --> 01:04:14.990
drinking when it was a fetus.

01:04:14.990 --> 01:04:17.520
How weird is that?

01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:19.770
More ones-- more ones?

01:04:19.770 --> 01:04:21.030
OK, that was good grammar.

01:04:21.030 --> 01:04:21.720
More ones.

01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:23.130
Here's one from humans.

01:04:23.130 --> 01:04:27.000
And this was a study,
which is as strange

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.090
as you can get,
looking at the fact

01:04:29.090 --> 01:04:32.690
that the diaphragm is
a very good resonating

01:04:32.690 --> 01:04:34.660
membrane, something or other.

01:04:34.660 --> 01:04:39.360
Mother's voices are heard in
the fetal sack quite readily.

01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:42.210
And if I don't know how they
got the fiber-optic camera

01:04:42.210 --> 01:04:44.510
in there, I have no idea
how they got the microphones

01:04:44.510 --> 01:04:45.990
in there for recording that.

01:04:45.990 --> 01:04:49.990
But it is a very resonant
chamber, the diaphragm

01:04:49.990 --> 01:04:51.630
and the amniotic fluid.

01:04:51.630 --> 01:04:55.380
Fetuses hear a lot of
what's going on out there,

01:04:55.380 --> 01:04:57.910
most notably mom's voice.

01:04:57.910 --> 01:05:01.220
So this was a study, a
totally inspired one.

01:05:01.220 --> 01:05:03.990
And what you had
was, in this one,

01:05:03.990 --> 01:05:06.770
pregnant women spent
their last trimester

01:05:06.770 --> 01:05:10.130
loudly reading either
The Cat in the Hat

01:05:10.130 --> 01:05:12.480
over and over, like
four times a day

01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:15.530
or something, until they
went mad, absolutely mad--

01:05:15.530 --> 01:05:17.310
and that's before the
kid was even born--

01:05:17.310 --> 01:05:21.400
or reading some random
collection of sentences that

01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:24.690
controlled for word length,
that controlled for rhythmicity,

01:05:24.690 --> 01:05:26.310
all of that.

01:05:26.310 --> 01:05:29.880
Then, you get the
newborn some time later,

01:05:29.880 --> 01:05:35.530
and you give them a test of
which they prefer to listen to.

01:05:35.530 --> 01:05:37.960
How do you do that
with a newborn?

01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:41.650
Something you can do is,
when newborns like something,

01:05:41.650 --> 01:05:44.860
they make more sucking
motions with their mouth.

01:05:44.860 --> 01:05:49.490
So you've got a sucko-meter
thing in there measuring it.

01:05:49.490 --> 01:05:53.760
And the newborns prefer
hearing The Cat in the Hat.

01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:55.570
They learned it.

01:05:55.570 --> 01:05:57.640
Not a huge effect,
but nonetheless,

01:05:57.640 --> 01:05:59.170
what is up with that?

01:05:59.170 --> 01:06:01.670
Of course, a follow-up question
that maybe half the people

01:06:01.670 --> 01:06:04.430
in here would be wondering is,
well, what about the fathers?

01:06:04.430 --> 01:06:07.580
And they have the study with the
fathers reading Cat In The Hat

01:06:07.580 --> 01:06:11.690
and, you know, like a megaphone
on mom's belly and reading.

01:06:11.690 --> 01:06:13.250
And it doesn't work.

01:06:13.250 --> 01:06:15.340
It doesn't resonate
enough that side.

01:06:15.340 --> 01:06:17.590
Sounds from the mother.

01:06:17.590 --> 01:06:22.060
OK, so what we see here is this
whole world of stuff going on

01:06:22.060 --> 01:06:25.300
before behavior geneticists
show up and say,

01:06:25.300 --> 01:06:26.960
environment is just started.

01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:30.070
All these prenatal
effects of hormones,

01:06:30.070 --> 01:06:34.430
nutrition, sensory stimulation,
amazing, in some cases,

01:06:34.430 --> 01:06:35.510
multigenerational.

01:06:35.510 --> 01:06:36.102
Yeah?

01:06:36.102 --> 01:06:37.935
Did they catch up with
those children later,

01:06:37.935 --> 01:06:39.768
The Cat in the Hat
children, and see if they

01:06:39.768 --> 01:06:41.710
had a tendency to rhyme more?

01:06:41.710 --> 01:06:43.700
[LAUGHTER]

01:06:43.700 --> 01:06:45.310
Where are they now?

01:06:45.310 --> 01:06:49.406
Remarkably, all of them are
heads of states of countries.

01:06:49.406 --> 01:06:50.672
[LAUGHTER]

01:06:50.672 --> 01:06:52.630
People are still trying
to understand that one.

01:06:52.630 --> 01:06:55.310
But very good
follow-ups on that.

01:06:55.310 --> 01:06:58.610
So we've got this punch
line here, over and over,

01:06:58.610 --> 01:07:01.580
showing the power
of prenatal effects.

01:07:01.580 --> 01:07:02.730
One final study.

01:07:02.730 --> 01:07:05.670
And this was one carried out by
a scientist at Berkeley named,

01:07:05.670 --> 01:07:10.110
Darlene Francis, which took
some amazing surgical skills.

01:07:10.110 --> 01:07:13.210
So there are different
strains of rats

01:07:13.210 --> 01:07:17.190
that have been bred for
different levels of anxiety.

01:07:17.190 --> 01:07:20.250
And we've already heard about
one possibility for that.

01:07:20.250 --> 01:07:22.270
It turns out some
genetic differences

01:07:22.270 --> 01:07:25.780
in the promoter to the gene for
the benzodiazepine receptor.

01:07:25.780 --> 01:07:27.160
There's all sorts
of strains that

01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:29.710
have been bred for high,
low levels of anxiety

01:07:29.710 --> 01:07:31.100
that people have studied.

01:07:31.100 --> 01:07:32.610
They've been bred.

01:07:32.610 --> 01:07:34.950
These are transmissible traits.

01:07:34.950 --> 01:07:37.810
These are heritable,
these are genetic traits.

01:07:37.810 --> 01:07:40.870
Here's what Darlene
Francis did, which

01:07:40.870 --> 01:07:42.810
was she did an adoption study.

01:07:42.810 --> 01:07:45.400
What's the adoption paradigm
we've heard already?

01:07:45.400 --> 01:07:48.250
Right after birth, you
cross-foster the rats,

01:07:48.250 --> 01:07:50.040
or the kids get adopted.

01:07:50.040 --> 01:07:52.400
That's not the
adoption study she did.

01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:55.030
She transferred fetuses.

01:07:55.030 --> 01:07:57.480
She figured out how
to do the surgery

01:07:57.480 --> 01:08:00.890
to remove a fetus early on
in development from one rat

01:08:00.890 --> 01:08:04.240
mom to another rat mom where
they developed perfectly

01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:06.390
normally, once she
had this surgery down.

01:08:06.390 --> 01:08:08.850
And you know what turns
out to be the case?

01:08:08.850 --> 01:08:11.120
It's not a genetic trait.

01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:12.670
It was not a genetic trait.

01:08:12.670 --> 01:08:15.620
You grew up with
the anxiety levels

01:08:15.620 --> 01:08:18.120
matching the strain
of your mother,

01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:22.500
even if the strain of the
individual whose body you

01:08:22.500 --> 01:08:26.359
fetally developed in-- you take
a mom from the high anxiety

01:08:26.359 --> 01:08:29.689
strain, and you take a mom
from the low anxiety strain.

01:08:29.689 --> 01:08:32.370
And you take fetuses from
the high anxiety mom,

01:08:32.370 --> 01:08:35.359
and they go through gestation
in the low anxiety mom.

01:08:35.359 --> 01:08:38.200
And as adults, they
are low anxiety.

01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:42.200
It was not a genetic trait,
it was a prenatal one

01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:46.569
having to do with another one
of those multigenerational

01:08:46.569 --> 01:08:50.700
begatting by having early
experience influencing

01:08:50.700 --> 01:08:53.080
the nature of the pregnancy
you would eventually have,

01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:55.189
and thus, influencing
your fetus,

01:08:55.189 --> 01:08:58.100
producing a different pregnancy
for them down the line.

01:08:58.100 --> 01:09:00.819
This demonstration
of cross-fostering,

01:09:00.819 --> 01:09:04.220
of adopting, as early
as you possibly could,

01:09:04.220 --> 01:09:05.930
enormously important study.

01:09:05.930 --> 01:09:08.189
One really difficult one.

01:09:08.189 --> 01:09:11.380
Yet another wave pounding
on this point, environment

01:09:11.380 --> 01:09:13.180
does not begin at birth.

01:09:13.180 --> 01:09:15.300
And some of the most
important environment

01:09:15.300 --> 01:09:18.020
is not occurring
starting at birth.

01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:20.590
And everything about
behavior genetics,

01:09:20.590 --> 01:09:23.840
classically, was
predicated on there's

01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:25.609
no environment before that.

01:09:25.609 --> 01:09:27.430
OK, so what do they
come back with?

01:09:27.430 --> 01:09:28.620
What's the response?

01:09:28.620 --> 01:09:30.399
We've already seen
a possible way

01:09:30.399 --> 01:09:35.260
of controlling for that, which
is, if you see traits shared

01:09:35.260 --> 01:09:38.590
in common with the
biological father,

01:09:38.590 --> 01:09:40.580
and then you see
more traits shared

01:09:40.580 --> 01:09:43.520
in common with the biological
mother, the increased

01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:48.060
degree of sharedness with the
mom reflects, not the genes,

01:09:48.060 --> 01:09:50.810
because you're getting
the same amount of genes

01:09:50.810 --> 01:09:51.779
from each parent.

01:09:51.779 --> 01:09:54.260
It reflects the
prenatal environment.

01:09:54.260 --> 01:09:57.830
That would be the control that
would be used in these studies.

01:09:57.830 --> 01:09:59.750
The extent to which
a trait is more

01:09:59.750 --> 01:10:03.890
shared with a biological mother
than with a biological father

01:10:03.890 --> 01:10:06.780
is a reflection of
prenatal effects,

01:10:06.780 --> 01:10:10.920
because you get the same amount
of genes from each parent.

01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:15.320
Naturally, this turns out to
be vastly messier than this.

01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:17.080
Because there's a
whole world in which

01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:20.190
you're getting more genetic
influences from your mother

01:10:20.190 --> 01:10:21.910
than from your father.

01:10:21.910 --> 01:10:22.770
OK.

01:10:22.770 --> 01:10:24.926
First one is, once
again, if it turns out

01:10:24.926 --> 01:10:27.300
the person who's claiming to
be the father isn't actually

01:10:27.300 --> 01:10:30.120
the father, that kind of
changes the whole map.

01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:32.120
And once again,
that is a problem

01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:35.300
running through all of human
behavior genetics literature.

01:10:35.300 --> 01:10:38.010
But here, here's the next one.

01:10:38.010 --> 01:10:41.230
Here, we have-- just make sure
we've got our cliche in place

01:10:41.230 --> 01:10:43.330
here-- what is this?

01:10:43.330 --> 01:10:44.547
This is the--

01:10:47.290 --> 01:10:49.990
OK, which is the
what of the cell?

01:10:49.990 --> 01:10:50.720
Powerhouse,

01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:51.540
The powerhouse.

01:10:51.540 --> 01:10:55.010
OK, here we have the powerhouse
of the cell, mitochondria.

01:10:55.010 --> 01:10:58.210
And in this rather odd cell,
there's one mitochondrion,

01:10:58.210 --> 01:11:01.220
but it is standing in for
all of the powerhouses.

01:11:01.220 --> 01:11:03.020
And we've got mitochondria.

01:11:03.020 --> 01:11:05.420
Something that, when you
first learn about this,

01:11:05.420 --> 01:11:08.380
is just flabbergasting,
which is, here

01:11:08.380 --> 01:11:11.650
you've got a cell with
its DNA, and its nucleus,

01:11:11.650 --> 01:11:14.300
and its double helix
thingy happening there.

01:11:14.300 --> 01:11:16.530
And it turns out
that mitochondria

01:11:16.530 --> 01:11:19.440
have their own DNA.

01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:21.660
And this is part
of explaining one

01:11:21.660 --> 01:11:26.930
of the, like, truly amazing,
adventurous, nutty ideas

01:11:26.930 --> 01:11:28.470
that have turned out to be true.

01:11:28.470 --> 01:11:31.790
Scientist, named Lynn Margulis,
University of Massachusetts,

01:11:31.790 --> 01:11:36.090
30 years ago or so, she
noted that this business

01:11:36.090 --> 01:11:38.850
of mitochondria
having their own DNA,

01:11:38.850 --> 01:11:42.240
and came up with this hypothesis
that mitochondria used

01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:44.410
to be independent organisms.

01:11:44.410 --> 01:11:47.480
That in some symbiotic
whatever, billions of years

01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:51.870
ago, got into cells that had
no mitochrondia at the time,

01:11:51.870 --> 01:11:54.900
and that there's been
a symbiosis ever since.

01:11:54.900 --> 01:11:57.590
Mitochondria have
DNA, which are related

01:11:57.590 --> 01:12:00.010
to mitochondrial function.

01:12:00.010 --> 01:12:02.920
Not a ton of the
stuff, nonetheless, you

01:12:02.920 --> 01:12:06.307
have every gene that is critical
for mitochondrial function.

01:12:06.307 --> 01:12:07.140
No, that's not true.

01:12:07.140 --> 01:12:08.910
A few of them have
wound up in here.

01:12:08.910 --> 01:12:11.060
But all of the genes
in here are pretty

01:12:11.060 --> 01:12:13.610
important for
mitochondrial powerhousing,

01:12:13.610 --> 01:12:14.890
all that sort of thing.

01:12:14.890 --> 01:12:19.950
And these are derived from
a completely different world

01:12:19.950 --> 01:12:22.590
of DNA than these.

01:12:22.590 --> 01:12:24.570
So now consider this.

01:12:24.570 --> 01:12:27.580
This cell is an egg.

01:12:27.580 --> 01:12:30.600
This cell is not an egg.

01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:36.990
This cell is just merely
carrying genetic information

01:12:36.990 --> 01:12:38.430
that looks like that.

01:12:38.430 --> 01:12:42.140
What you've got is sperm,
all they are carrying

01:12:42.140 --> 01:12:46.430
are the DNAs, the
genes, the DNA.

01:12:46.430 --> 01:12:50.560
And they don't have cytoplasm,
the fluid-y environment

01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:51.430
in a cell.

01:12:51.430 --> 01:12:54.240
This is one major
dense packing job.

01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:56.800
Here's the critical implication.

01:12:56.800 --> 01:13:02.520
Eggs have mitochondria,
sperm don't.

01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:05.420
So right at the point
of fertilization,

01:13:05.420 --> 01:13:10.710
you have gotten all of your
mitochondria from your mother.

01:13:10.710 --> 01:13:13.430
And thus, all of
the genes related

01:13:13.430 --> 01:13:15.360
to mitochondrial
function that are

01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:19.160
contained in the mitochondria
you don't get from fathers.

01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:22.220
It is exclusively
inherited from mothers.

01:13:22.220 --> 01:13:26.690
Mitochondrial DNA solely
comes from the mother.

01:13:26.690 --> 01:13:28.730
So what we've just
seen as a first pass

01:13:28.730 --> 01:13:31.650
is it's not an even 50/50 split.

01:13:31.650 --> 01:13:34.380
You get a disproportionate
share of your DNA

01:13:34.380 --> 01:13:36.180
coming from the mother.

01:13:36.180 --> 01:13:37.500
Really important.

01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:39.320
And one that's been
used by all sorts

01:13:39.320 --> 01:13:42.990
of evolutionary geneticists
to trace legacies.

01:13:42.990 --> 01:13:48.410
If these mitochondrial DNA is
only passed along female lines,

01:13:48.410 --> 01:13:51.210
that allows you to figure
out all sorts of stuff

01:13:51.210 --> 01:13:52.420
about evolution.

01:13:52.420 --> 01:13:56.430
It has given rise to the Eve
hypothesis, that somewhere back

01:13:56.430 --> 01:14:00.700
then was a woman, probably
some sort of early hominid,

01:14:00.700 --> 01:14:05.380
who is ultimately the ancestor,
the great, great, great, great,

01:14:05.380 --> 01:14:08.330
great, grandmother of every
single human on Earth.

01:14:08.330 --> 01:14:12.160
And it can be traced through
the mitochondrial DNA.

01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:14.030
So that's an asymmetry.

01:14:14.030 --> 01:14:15.020
Next one.

01:14:15.020 --> 01:14:18.320
Next source of asymmetry
is back to that business

01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:20.290
about imprinted genes.

01:14:20.290 --> 01:14:22.270
From a couple of weeks
ago, you remember

01:14:22.270 --> 01:14:25.140
that one, genes that
are working differently,

01:14:25.140 --> 01:14:28.210
depending on which parent
you are getting them from.

01:14:28.210 --> 01:14:30.970
So that one's a violation
as well of this rule

01:14:30.970 --> 01:14:35.230
that you get all of your DNA in
equal amounts from each parent.

01:14:35.230 --> 01:14:39.050
This is another thing that
possibly skews the ratio.

01:14:39.050 --> 01:14:42.090
Now, here's another
very interesting thing.

01:14:42.090 --> 01:14:44.170
So you've got the egg here.

01:14:44.170 --> 01:14:47.690
And not only does it have this
cytoplasm with mitochondria

01:14:47.690 --> 01:14:51.110
floating around,
but in addition,

01:14:51.110 --> 01:14:53.130
there's other stuff
floating around in there,

01:14:53.130 --> 01:14:56.290
like transcription factors.

01:14:56.290 --> 01:14:59.190
Sperm don't have
transcription factors.

01:14:59.190 --> 01:15:02.480
Sperm, all they're doing is on
this, like, suicide swimming

01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:03.350
mission there.

01:15:03.350 --> 01:15:05.000
And they're not
making any new genes.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.700
All they're doing is
this one, long spurt

01:15:07.700 --> 01:15:09.700
of racing for the end.

01:15:09.700 --> 01:15:12.160
And in the case of
the eggs, though, you

01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:14.000
have transcription factors.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:17.430
You have all sorts of
proteins in the cytoplasm.

01:15:17.430 --> 01:15:20.750
You've got a fully functioning
cell, instead of this, sort of,

01:15:20.750 --> 01:15:23.520
much more streamlined version.

01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:28.430
All the transcription factors
that come in a fertilized egg

01:15:28.430 --> 01:15:31.130
are coming from the mother.

01:15:31.130 --> 01:15:33.542
So what does that
wind up meaning?

01:15:33.542 --> 01:15:36.120
Transcription factors,
those are proteins.

01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:37.580
We're not talking
about genes here.

01:15:37.580 --> 01:15:39.560
We just saw how
you get more genes

01:15:39.560 --> 01:15:41.140
from your mother
than your father,

01:15:41.140 --> 01:15:42.940
these mitochondrial genes.

01:15:42.940 --> 01:15:45.590
OK, but transcription
factors, the father

01:15:45.590 --> 01:15:47.310
has genes for
transcription factors.

01:15:47.310 --> 01:15:49.520
The mother has genes for
transcription factors.

01:15:49.520 --> 01:15:52.840
What's the significance of
getting your transcription

01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:56.850
factors from your mother
in the fertilized egg?

01:15:56.850 --> 01:15:57.630
OK.

01:15:57.630 --> 01:16:01.200
Consider here two genes.

01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:05.950
The first one codes for
transcription factor A.

01:16:05.950 --> 01:16:06.930
We know that already.

01:16:06.930 --> 01:16:08.940
Transcription factors
are typically proteins,

01:16:08.940 --> 01:16:11.070
so they have their own
genes all the way down.

01:16:11.070 --> 01:16:16.600
And this codes for gene
X, whatever that is.

01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:19.120
So here's what you've got.

01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:25.760
There are promoters responsive
to transcription factor A.

01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:29.950
Transcription factor A turns
on the synthesis of the protein

01:16:29.950 --> 01:16:32.550
coded for by gene
X. And in addition,

01:16:32.550 --> 01:16:37.060
transcription factor A turns
on transcription factor A gene.

01:16:37.060 --> 01:16:39.130
It's a positive feedback
loop where it makes

01:16:39.130 --> 01:16:40.720
more and more of the stuff.

01:16:40.720 --> 01:16:43.950
That's the way this particular
transcription factor works.

01:16:43.950 --> 01:16:46.870
So suppose this is
the only thing that

01:16:46.870 --> 01:16:51.570
can activate transcription
of gene X. So

01:16:51.570 --> 01:16:55.210
suppose you've got some
environmental event which,

01:16:55.210 --> 01:16:59.540
as a result of it, knocks out
the activity of transcription

01:16:59.540 --> 01:17:04.220
factor X in an egg.

01:17:04.220 --> 01:17:05.560
The egg is fertilized.

01:17:05.560 --> 01:17:12.540
And as a result of transcription
factor A not being expressed,

01:17:12.540 --> 01:17:13.740
it doesn't express more.

01:17:13.740 --> 01:17:16.090
This is the only thing that
drives more expression.

01:17:16.090 --> 01:17:19.490
And you never make gene X.

01:17:19.490 --> 01:17:22.640
Now, somewhere along
the line in your body,

01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:26.650
you are soon making eggs
which contain these genes,

01:17:26.650 --> 01:17:29.270
of course, but
where you have never

01:17:29.270 --> 01:17:33.620
expressed transcription factor
A, because this was knocked out

01:17:33.620 --> 01:17:34.440
in the egg.

01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:38.540
So because of that, you
never express gene X.

01:17:38.540 --> 01:17:40.230
And that egg gets fertilized.

01:17:40.230 --> 01:17:43.660
And you pass on that
trait to your offspring.

01:17:43.660 --> 01:17:48.880
You pass that on, this
acquired trait of transcription

01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:50.380
factor A not working.

01:17:50.380 --> 01:17:52.890
If this is the
circuitry that you have,

01:17:52.890 --> 01:17:56.520
it doesn't matter which
version of gene X you get,

01:17:56.520 --> 01:17:59.720
you are never going to express
that gene for generations

01:17:59.720 --> 01:18:03.010
and generations, forever,
if this is the loop.

01:18:03.010 --> 01:18:06.830
What's going on here, what a
lot of people think is relevant,

01:18:06.830 --> 01:18:09.710
are some environmental
toxins that

01:18:09.710 --> 01:18:11.920
are known to
disrupt the activity

01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:13.970
of certain
transcription factors.

01:18:13.970 --> 01:18:17.740
And what that does is
induce heritability

01:18:17.740 --> 01:18:21.180
in a non-genetic way of
non-expressing of a gene.

01:18:21.180 --> 01:18:24.020
The gene's being inherited,
but it will never ever

01:18:24.020 --> 01:18:25.000
be expressed.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
What have you just acquired?

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.390
A Lamarckian trait.

01:18:29.390 --> 01:18:30.650
You remember Lamarck.

01:18:30.650 --> 01:18:33.880
Everybody learns about Lamarck,
in order to mock him viciously.

01:18:33.880 --> 01:18:37.430
And Lamarck had the notion that
the way evolutionary change

01:18:37.430 --> 01:18:39.220
works, the way
inheritance works,

01:18:39.220 --> 01:18:41.660
is you experience
something, and it

01:18:41.660 --> 01:18:43.490
causes a change in your body.

01:18:43.490 --> 01:18:46.800
And as a result, you pass
on that acquired trait

01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:48.280
to your offspring.

01:18:48.280 --> 01:18:49.020
Ludicrous.

01:18:49.020 --> 01:18:52.580
Lamarckians have been mocked
and pilloried for centuries,

01:18:52.580 --> 01:18:56.300
except in the Soviet Union in
the 1930s, where it gave rise

01:18:56.300 --> 01:19:00.580
to Lysenkoism, a very horrific
piece of genetic history.

01:19:00.580 --> 01:19:03.120
But what you've got is
this complete trashing

01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:05.810
of the notion of you
acquire some trait

01:19:05.810 --> 01:19:09.620
from the environment, and you
pass it on to your offspring.

01:19:09.620 --> 01:19:12.400
This is Lamarckian inheritance.

01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:15.650
This is an environmental factor
that knocks this transcription

01:19:15.650 --> 01:19:17.210
factor out of action.

01:19:17.210 --> 01:19:20.020
And if this is the
wiring that you've got,

01:19:20.020 --> 01:19:22.360
this gene will
never be expressed.

01:19:22.360 --> 01:19:25.350
And as a result, it will never
be expressed in your offspring,

01:19:25.350 --> 01:19:27.830
in your grandkids, et
cetera, all the way down.

01:19:27.830 --> 01:19:30.670
This is Lamarckian
inheritance of a trait.

01:19:30.670 --> 01:19:33.770
And again, where the best
evidence for this has been

01:19:33.770 --> 01:19:37.040
is with environmental
toxins that knock out,

01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:40.750
that have some of these
mutating effects in eggs.

01:19:40.750 --> 01:19:44.200
They are not mutations
in a classical DNA sense.

01:19:44.200 --> 01:19:46.660
But nonetheless, they
are now heritable.

01:19:46.660 --> 01:19:48.830
So that pops up also.

01:19:48.830 --> 01:19:50.160
So have we got here?

01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:52.370
We have the simple
assumption that,

01:19:52.370 --> 01:19:56.150
if you see more sharing
of a trait with the mother

01:19:56.150 --> 01:19:57.920
than with the father,
that's reflecting

01:19:57.920 --> 01:19:59.420
prenatal environment.

01:19:59.420 --> 01:20:01.250
And what we've seen
here is totally

01:20:01.250 --> 01:20:04.110
messing this up is the
fact that you do not

01:20:04.110 --> 01:20:07.280
get equal genetic
influences from each parent.

01:20:07.280 --> 01:20:09.420
You are getting more
genetic material,

01:20:09.420 --> 01:20:11.660
you are getting more
genes from your mother,

01:20:11.660 --> 01:20:15.090
because the mitochondrial DNA.

01:20:15.090 --> 01:20:17.700
Even if you are getting
equal amounts of DNA,

01:20:17.700 --> 01:20:20.210
expression of them will
have different consequences

01:20:20.210 --> 01:20:23.160
because of imprinted genes.

01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:25.430
Finally, in this
world, having nothing

01:20:25.430 --> 01:20:29.710
to do with the amount of
genes or the actual DNA,

01:20:29.710 --> 01:20:32.160
you can have this
Lamarckian inheritance

01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:35.220
of traits due to
environmental perturbations.

01:20:35.220 --> 01:20:37.220
What we see here
are ways ranging

01:20:37.220 --> 01:20:41.320
from extremely subtle and rare
to some rather substantial ones

01:20:41.320 --> 01:20:44.710
with the mitochondria where
you are not getting equivalent

01:20:44.710 --> 01:20:46.660
inheritance from both parents.

01:20:46.660 --> 01:20:49.300
So that confuses things a lot.

01:20:49.300 --> 01:20:50.210
OK.

01:20:50.210 --> 01:20:53.640
So after all of that,
you do, nonetheless,

01:20:53.640 --> 01:20:57.610
get circumstances where
behavior is influenced by genes.

01:20:57.610 --> 01:21:00.270
And by every rule,
it could be shown.

01:21:00.270 --> 01:21:02.580
And by the most
contemporary of techniques

01:21:02.580 --> 01:21:05.510
where people find
the gene and the DNA,

01:21:05.510 --> 01:21:08.370
and they've traced out the steps
in showing that there really

01:21:08.370 --> 01:21:11.050
are genetic influences
on behavior,

01:21:11.050 --> 01:21:15.170
and ones that withstand every
single one of these criticisms.

01:21:15.170 --> 01:21:15.770
OK.

01:21:15.770 --> 01:21:18.400
So sometimes, you've
got genes regulating

01:21:18.400 --> 01:21:20.750
or genes influencing behavior.

01:21:20.750 --> 01:21:23.670
But now we bring in a
whole other possibility.

01:21:23.670 --> 01:21:25.410
And this is something
that was emphasized

01:21:25.410 --> 01:21:29.390
by a psychologist named, Judith
Rich Harris, a number of years

01:21:29.390 --> 01:21:33.000
ago, in a very important book
of hers, called The Nurture

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:36.420
Assumption, which has a
lot to do with arguing

01:21:36.420 --> 01:21:38.320
the relative importance
of influences

01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:40.000
of peer versus parents.

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:41.930
Nonetheless, she
focused in one section

01:21:41.930 --> 01:21:44.750
of the book on the
genetics of behavior

01:21:44.750 --> 01:21:49.580
and focused on what she calls
indirect genetic effects.

01:21:49.580 --> 01:21:52.560
What would indirect
genetic effects be?

01:21:52.560 --> 01:21:53.450
OK.

01:21:53.450 --> 01:21:55.270
You've got that
trait that I referred

01:21:55.270 --> 01:21:57.560
to before, one of
the most reliable

01:21:57.560 --> 01:22:00.070
of traits in the
identical twins separated

01:22:00.070 --> 01:22:03.590
at birth business, 50%
heritability of where

01:22:03.590 --> 01:22:09.410
you are on the introversion,
extroversion continuum.

01:22:09.410 --> 01:22:10.430
OK.

01:22:10.430 --> 01:22:12.650
So that one has
held up pretty well.

01:22:12.650 --> 01:22:16.450
Amid all the possible complaints
about these various approaches,

01:22:16.450 --> 01:22:18.440
that one appears
to be quite solid.

01:22:18.440 --> 01:22:20.780
And you're immediately
off and running

01:22:20.780 --> 01:22:26.270
with, OK, genes for
extroversion, for sociality,

01:22:26.270 --> 01:22:27.330
for all of that.

01:22:27.330 --> 01:22:31.010
What she shows instead is
something else is happening.

01:22:31.010 --> 01:22:37.180
There's a very, very heritable
trait from parent to offspring,

01:22:37.180 --> 01:22:40.030
one of the most heritable
physical traits out there,

01:22:40.030 --> 01:22:45.440
which is your height and
your appearance in general,

01:22:45.440 --> 01:22:48.300
that those are highly
heritable traits.

01:22:48.300 --> 01:22:51.900
And suddenly, you
have a phenomenon that

01:22:51.900 --> 01:22:54.910
is well-documented,
which is people

01:22:54.910 --> 01:22:58.360
who are taller are treated
better and considered

01:22:58.360 --> 01:23:01.608
more attractive, comma,
he says bitterly.

01:23:01.608 --> 01:23:03.090
[LAUGHTER]

01:23:03.090 --> 01:23:05.940
What you've got is people
are treated differently

01:23:05.940 --> 01:23:07.480
along those lines.

01:23:07.480 --> 01:23:09.980
And what is known
also is, people

01:23:09.980 --> 01:23:13.510
who are treated more
positively during development,

01:23:13.510 --> 01:23:17.170
during childhood,
become more extroverted.

01:23:17.170 --> 01:23:21.330
What we have here is not
heritability of the trait

01:23:21.330 --> 01:23:22.810
where you are in
the introversion,

01:23:22.810 --> 01:23:24.430
extroversion continuum.

01:23:24.430 --> 01:23:28.440
What you have is heritability
of a physical trait, which

01:23:28.440 --> 01:23:30.200
causes you to be
treated differently

01:23:30.200 --> 01:23:34.610
in the world, which then brings
about changes in personality.

01:23:34.610 --> 01:23:37.490
And studies have
since shown that most

01:23:37.490 --> 01:23:40.480
of the heritability of the
introversion, extroversion

01:23:40.480 --> 01:23:44.380
is mediated by physical
traits in between.

01:23:44.380 --> 01:23:47.530
So that's a completely
indirect way in which

01:23:47.530 --> 01:23:49.690
you could have gotten to this.

01:23:49.690 --> 01:23:50.880
More cases.

01:23:50.880 --> 01:23:52.300
More cases of this.

01:23:52.300 --> 01:23:53.720
Let's see.

01:23:53.720 --> 01:24:00.810
OK, you can show, in various
bird, turkey, hen species,

01:24:00.810 --> 01:24:04.390
that there are chicks, that
there is heritability of rank.

01:24:04.390 --> 01:24:06.990
You could be born
to a low-ranking mom

01:24:06.990 --> 01:24:08.890
in the pecking
order, high-ranking,

01:24:08.890 --> 01:24:11.350
all the perfect
studies, and controls,

01:24:11.350 --> 01:24:13.170
and cross-fostering,
all of that,

01:24:13.170 --> 01:24:16.110
and there is
heritability of rank.

01:24:16.110 --> 01:24:18.310
But another indirect
genetic effect

01:24:18.310 --> 01:24:20.950
that was subsequently
demonstrated, which is it's

01:24:20.950 --> 01:24:23.160
not the rank that's
being inherited,

01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:25.160
it's a particular
version of genes

01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:29.560
related to melanism of
your feathers, the color

01:24:29.560 --> 01:24:31.640
and iridescence
of your feathers.

01:24:31.640 --> 01:24:34.930
And it turns out, if you have
a certain color pattern, all

01:24:34.930 --> 01:24:37.160
the other like
roosters, and chicks,

01:24:37.160 --> 01:24:40.690
and hens, and poultry,
peck at you more often.

01:24:40.690 --> 01:24:43.290
And you're reduced
to subordination.

01:24:43.290 --> 01:24:47.100
This is not inheritance
of a social dominant trait

01:24:47.100 --> 01:24:49.080
or a social subordination trait.

01:24:49.080 --> 01:24:50.930
This is inheritance
of a gene having

01:24:50.930 --> 01:24:54.420
to do with the color and
iridescence of your feathers,

01:24:54.420 --> 01:24:57.990
which wind up producing
your social rank.

01:24:57.990 --> 01:24:59.510
Another example.

01:24:59.510 --> 01:25:00.670
Here's another one.

01:25:00.670 --> 01:25:03.660
OK, back to chicks
again, which is chicks

01:25:03.660 --> 01:25:08.220
appear to be intuitively
able to peck at grubs shortly

01:25:08.220 --> 01:25:09.470
after birth.

01:25:09.470 --> 01:25:11.790
That they're able to
peck down and get grubs.

01:25:11.790 --> 01:25:14.240
And by all the rules
of behavior genetics,

01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:16.940
with all the constraints
and criticisms answered,

01:25:16.940 --> 01:25:19.710
this appears to be
a heritable trait.

01:25:19.710 --> 01:25:22.750
But it turns out that this
is not what is heritable.

01:25:22.750 --> 01:25:27.470
What is heritable, bizarrely, is
the tendency of newborn chicks

01:25:27.470 --> 01:25:30.280
to find their toes to
be very interesting

01:25:30.280 --> 01:25:32.170
and to peck at their toes.

01:25:32.170 --> 01:25:35.260
And they quickly learn that this
doesn't feel all that great.

01:25:35.260 --> 01:25:37.744
But if you do it in somewhat
more sloppy of a way,

01:25:37.744 --> 01:25:39.160
you get one of
these things that's

01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:41.300
squirmy that tastes good.

01:25:41.300 --> 01:25:44.190
They start off, what is
genetic is the tendency

01:25:44.190 --> 01:25:47.160
to peck at your feet.

01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:48.050
God knows why.

01:25:48.050 --> 01:25:50.220
If you are a newborn
chick, because

01:25:50.220 --> 01:25:53.360
of extremely elegant
high technology

01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:56.210
studies in which newborn
chicks are put in galoshes

01:25:56.210 --> 01:25:57.850
or something and
they don't pack,

01:25:57.850 --> 01:26:01.490
and they don't show the
seemingly innate ability to

01:26:01.490 --> 01:26:03.020
peck for grubs.

01:26:03.020 --> 01:26:05.100
So here, we have
a behavioral trait

01:26:05.100 --> 01:26:09.820
which, in fact, is indirectly
mediated by something else.

01:26:09.820 --> 01:26:11.210
More examples.

01:26:11.210 --> 01:26:16.250
There is, by now, a literature
showing approximately 70%

01:26:16.250 --> 01:26:19.680
heritability-- and I
keep using this word.

01:26:19.680 --> 01:26:23.070
We are going to dissect the
word, "heritability" big time

01:26:23.070 --> 01:26:25.830
in a short while--
There's about 70%

01:26:25.830 --> 01:26:31.440
heritability of political party
affiliation in this country.

01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:35.590
Sharing that behavioral
trait with your parents.

01:26:35.590 --> 01:26:36.660
Whoa.

01:26:36.660 --> 01:26:38.200
What is that about?

01:26:38.200 --> 01:26:40.190
That's sure disturbing.

01:26:40.190 --> 01:26:42.780
And that sure makes
you want to procreate

01:26:42.780 --> 01:26:45.890
in the name of your political
stances, or whatever.

01:26:45.890 --> 01:26:48.350
And this appears to
hold up pretty well

01:26:48.350 --> 01:26:51.310
to some of the standard
criticisms in the literature.

01:26:51.310 --> 01:26:53.340
And it's got nothing
to do with this.

01:26:53.340 --> 01:26:55.460
What's the mediating variable?

01:26:55.460 --> 01:26:58.030
A large really
interesting literature

01:26:58.030 --> 01:27:01.460
showing, when you compare
political or social

01:27:01.460 --> 01:27:05.610
progressives with political
or social conservatives, one

01:27:05.610 --> 01:27:08.280
of the most reliable
personality differences

01:27:08.280 --> 01:27:12.000
is how they feel
about ambiguity.

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:16.220
Conservatives, on the average
do not like ambiguity.

01:27:16.220 --> 01:27:18.580
They are much more
ambiguity-averse.

01:27:18.580 --> 01:27:20.460
And you can start
it with showing

01:27:20.460 --> 01:27:23.470
ambiguous sensory
stimuli in kids

01:27:23.470 --> 01:27:26.170
and looking at heart
rate responses to it.

01:27:26.170 --> 01:27:29.470
And that tends to be a
stable personality difference

01:27:29.470 --> 01:27:31.460
at political extremes.

01:27:31.460 --> 01:27:33.940
You will see, some
time later on,

01:27:33.940 --> 01:27:37.060
that there's a whole world
of moral development in kids

01:27:37.060 --> 01:27:39.900
where there's various
scales measuring.

01:27:39.900 --> 01:27:42.910
One's Kohlberg's Stage
of Moral Development.

01:27:42.910 --> 01:27:44.760
There was an old
literature suggesting

01:27:44.760 --> 01:27:48.370
political differences as to
how fancy of a Kohlberg stage

01:27:48.370 --> 01:27:48.990
you got to.

01:27:48.990 --> 01:27:51.220
We will see that,
despite what struck me

01:27:51.220 --> 01:27:54.210
as the intuitive sort of
logic of what was found.

01:27:54.210 --> 01:27:55.440
That one hasn't held up.

01:27:55.440 --> 01:27:58.050
But one that does
hold up is difference

01:27:58.050 --> 01:28:00.210
in ambiguity tolerance.

01:28:00.210 --> 01:28:03.250
And that's probably
the mediating trait.

01:28:03.250 --> 01:28:07.340
It is not inheriting a tendency
to like elephants, or donkeys,

01:28:07.340 --> 01:28:08.140
or whatever.

01:28:08.140 --> 01:28:10.780
It is instead having
this intermediate trait.

01:28:10.780 --> 01:28:13.790
Final example of what would
be an intermediate trait.

01:28:13.790 --> 01:28:16.240
There's a whole bunch
of rat and mouse strains

01:28:16.240 --> 01:28:17.900
that have been
developed that have

01:28:17.900 --> 01:28:21.850
differing levels of aggression,
high aggression strains.

01:28:21.850 --> 01:28:23.810
And you do all the
proper controls,

01:28:23.810 --> 01:28:26.010
and you can show that
this is a genetic trait.

01:28:26.010 --> 01:28:28.630
Whoa, heritability
of aggression.

01:28:28.630 --> 01:28:32.600
We're suddenly back to twin
adoption studies and Kety

01:28:32.600 --> 01:28:35.360
with heritability of
criminality, all of that,

01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:38.720
heritability of aggression,
what's actually going on

01:28:38.720 --> 01:28:43.050
in all of the strains identified
to date by spontaneous traits

01:28:43.050 --> 01:28:44.800
coming up and then
breeding for it.

01:28:44.800 --> 01:28:47.040
What you see instead
is the strain

01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:51.330
that is so aggressive, and
so pissy, and so impossible,

01:28:51.330 --> 01:28:55.210
and so constrained by the law
and order of rodent society,

01:28:55.210 --> 01:28:56.070
and all of that.

01:28:56.070 --> 01:28:59.640
They've got a lower threshold
for pain sensitivity.

01:28:59.640 --> 01:29:01.860
Things hurt them more readily.

01:29:01.860 --> 01:29:04.080
And they're more likely
to become aggressive

01:29:04.080 --> 01:29:05.010
at that point.

01:29:05.010 --> 01:29:08.850
It turns out it's genetic
differences in the neurobiology

01:29:08.850 --> 01:29:10.530
of pain sensitivity.

01:29:10.530 --> 01:29:13.030
So what we're seeing
here, over and over is,

01:29:13.030 --> 01:29:16.410
amid the gazillion
of criticisms we've

01:29:16.410 --> 01:29:19.400
had about when does
environment actually start,

01:29:19.400 --> 01:29:21.200
and when do
environmental assumptions

01:29:21.200 --> 01:29:22.950
and being treated
the same go down

01:29:22.950 --> 01:29:25.630
the tubes, and differential
inheritance of genes,

01:29:25.630 --> 01:29:28.310
yeah some traits do appear
to have some fairly strong

01:29:28.310 --> 01:29:29.550
genetic components.

01:29:29.550 --> 01:29:32.940
But even once you get
that far, they very often

01:29:32.940 --> 01:29:36.230
are through some
very indirect routes.

01:29:36.230 --> 01:29:39.320
OK more things here.

01:29:39.320 --> 01:29:39.920
More things?

01:29:39.920 --> 01:29:41.100
We just covered that.

01:29:41.100 --> 01:29:43.430
OK, a little bit
more on epigenetics,

01:29:43.430 --> 01:29:44.830
which is that
whole business, you

01:29:44.830 --> 01:29:46.960
remember, from the
other day, which

01:29:46.960 --> 01:29:50.640
is after you've got
the DNA, and then you

01:29:50.640 --> 01:29:54.460
have that whole world of
protein coatings, which

01:29:54.460 --> 01:29:57.020
I've been very careful not
to give the jargony name for,

01:29:57.020 --> 01:29:58.326
because it's not important.

01:29:58.326 --> 01:29:59.950
But what you've got
is this whole world

01:29:59.950 --> 01:30:04.370
where regulation is not so
much at the level of genes--

01:30:04.370 --> 01:30:07.670
and in 95% of the DNA,
that's the on/off switches--

01:30:07.670 --> 01:30:11.210
but whether the transcription
factors can even get in there,

01:30:11.210 --> 01:30:14.160
and this world of
epigenetic changes

01:30:14.160 --> 01:30:17.030
that will cause lifelong
differences in how

01:30:17.030 --> 01:30:20.380
readily transcription factors
get to something or other.

01:30:20.380 --> 01:30:22.320
What have you got at that point?

01:30:22.320 --> 01:30:26.440
The exact same possibilities
as this one here.

01:30:26.440 --> 01:30:29.370
If instead of, due to
some environmental toxin,

01:30:29.370 --> 01:30:33.390
you knock a transcription factor
out of business in a fertilized

01:30:33.390 --> 01:30:36.830
egg where there's the set up
of genes, if for some reason,

01:30:36.830 --> 01:30:39.340
whatever, you do not
have access to it because

01:30:39.340 --> 01:30:41.140
of an epigenetic
change, it's going

01:30:41.140 --> 01:30:43.410
to be the exact
same consequence,

01:30:43.410 --> 01:30:47.460
multigenerational inheritance
of non-genetic traits

01:30:47.460 --> 01:30:51.240
due to epigenetic, rather
than genetic differences.

01:30:51.240 --> 01:30:54.630
That is turning out to be what
went on in the Dutch Hunger

01:30:54.630 --> 01:30:56.410
Winter people and
the animal models

01:30:56.410 --> 01:31:00.960
of epigenetic differences and
access of transcription factors

01:31:00.960 --> 01:31:03.770
to genes related to
insulin metabolism.

01:31:03.770 --> 01:31:06.120
That turns out to
be a critical one.

01:31:06.120 --> 01:31:09.140
Here is one of the coolest
examples of this to date.

01:31:09.140 --> 01:31:11.900
And this is work done by a guy
at McGill University, named

01:31:11.900 --> 01:31:13.440
Michael Meaney.

01:31:13.440 --> 01:31:17.930
And what he has focused
on is what started off

01:31:17.930 --> 01:31:20.840
as a very artificial
literature, which is,

01:31:20.840 --> 01:31:24.920
take yourself a newborn rat,
and for the first two weeks

01:31:24.920 --> 01:31:26.580
or so of its life,
every day, you

01:31:26.580 --> 01:31:29.730
pick it up for three
minutes and you pet it.

01:31:29.730 --> 01:31:31.210
And now, you put it back.

01:31:31.210 --> 01:31:33.130
And all else being
equal, it will

01:31:33.130 --> 01:31:36.220
have a bigger brain in
adulthood, better learning

01:31:36.220 --> 01:31:38.440
abilities, more resistance
to a whole bunch

01:31:38.440 --> 01:31:42.070
of neurological insults,
lower glucocorticoid levels,

01:31:42.070 --> 01:31:44.010
et cetera, that
whole world of what

01:31:44.010 --> 01:31:47.070
came to be known as
neonatal handling.

01:31:47.070 --> 01:31:49.120
On the other hand,
pick up the rat,

01:31:49.120 --> 01:31:51.720
take it away from mom
for, instead of 3 minutes,

01:31:51.720 --> 01:31:53.140
an hour and a half.

01:31:53.140 --> 01:31:55.190
Then each day, put him back.

01:31:55.190 --> 01:31:57.890
And as an adult, it's going
to have a smaller brain

01:31:57.890 --> 01:31:59.460
and a shorter life expectancy.

01:31:59.460 --> 01:32:01.950
Three minutes away
from mom does wonders.

01:32:01.950 --> 01:32:04.570
An hour and a half of
being petted does not.

01:32:04.570 --> 01:32:07.390
That, in and of itself,
is interesting in terms

01:32:07.390 --> 01:32:10.560
of what counts as stimulation,
what counts as stress.

01:32:10.560 --> 01:32:12.640
OK, so hurray.

01:32:12.640 --> 01:32:15.050
What we've just
learned is just how

01:32:15.050 --> 01:32:18.040
generations of rat-petting
graduate students

01:32:18.040 --> 01:32:22.140
can influence the lineages of
rat brains and all of that.

01:32:22.140 --> 01:32:25.750
And what Meanie started
looking at with this phenomenon

01:32:25.750 --> 01:32:28.380
being one that was around
forever-- first identified

01:32:28.380 --> 01:32:30.850
around 1960 by a
guy named Seymour

01:32:30.850 --> 01:32:32.930
Levine in the Psychiatry
Department here,

01:32:32.930 --> 01:32:35.350
and no longer alive-- but
that started this whole world

01:32:35.350 --> 01:32:36.620
of neonatal handling.

01:32:36.620 --> 01:32:39.710
What Meanie did
was say, well, rats

01:32:39.710 --> 01:32:41.580
did not evolve, whatever
is going on here,

01:32:41.580 --> 01:32:43.460
for the purpose of
doctoral theses,

01:32:43.460 --> 01:32:48.610
what's the natural equivalent
in the world of a rodent?

01:32:48.610 --> 01:32:51.580
And it turns out that what
happens when you pick up

01:32:51.580 --> 01:32:54.080
a rat for three minutes and
do this and put it back,

01:32:54.080 --> 01:32:57.590
mom is all excited and
goes and checks out the pup

01:32:57.590 --> 01:33:03.480
and nestles it, and licks it,
and whatever other stuff there.

01:33:03.480 --> 01:33:05.380
And it has all this attention.

01:33:05.380 --> 01:33:08.110
Whereas, if you take the pup
out for an hour and a half,

01:33:08.110 --> 01:33:10.970
when you put him back
with mom, mom basically

01:33:10.970 --> 01:33:13.840
ignores the pup for
long periods of time.

01:33:13.840 --> 01:33:16.600
You're changing the
mother's behavior.

01:33:16.600 --> 01:33:19.120
OK, so that's an
indirect effect.

01:33:19.120 --> 01:33:21.600
And what he
proceeded to show was

01:33:21.600 --> 01:33:24.110
the critical thing about
the handling was not

01:33:24.110 --> 01:33:26.210
what you're doing to the
rat during that time,

01:33:26.210 --> 01:33:27.810
it's the fact that
you're causing

01:33:27.810 --> 01:33:32.530
dramatic changes in maternal
behavior based on that.

01:33:32.530 --> 01:33:33.670
So that's interesting.

01:33:33.670 --> 01:33:35.420
But that still doesn't
solve the problem

01:33:35.420 --> 01:33:38.590
of why did the system
evolve for grad students

01:33:38.590 --> 01:33:40.690
manipulating maternal behavior.

01:33:40.690 --> 01:33:42.430
And what he then
proceeded to look at

01:33:42.430 --> 01:33:46.700
was normal variation in
rat mothering styles,

01:33:46.700 --> 01:33:49.900
because some rat
mothers are-- OK,

01:33:49.900 --> 01:33:52.210
I know this is a
value judgement--

01:33:52.210 --> 01:33:55.990
but some rat mothers are better
mothers than other mothers.

01:33:55.990 --> 01:33:59.965
Some rat mothers, they
simply are better.

01:33:59.965 --> 01:34:00.590
They're better.

01:34:00.590 --> 01:34:02.100
They're nicer they
have better souls.

01:34:02.100 --> 01:34:02.600
[LAUGHTER]

01:34:02.600 --> 01:34:05.230
And in these rat mothers,
how do you determine that

01:34:05.230 --> 01:34:06.600
by these sorts of measures?

01:34:06.600 --> 01:34:08.030
Licking and grooming.

01:34:08.030 --> 01:34:10.730
How much time do you
spend licking your baby?

01:34:10.730 --> 01:34:13.230
And how much time do you
spend grooming your baby?

01:34:13.230 --> 01:34:15.040
And what Meanie
proceeded to show

01:34:15.040 --> 01:34:19.080
is that's what the neonatal
handling phenomenon was about.

01:34:19.080 --> 01:34:23.500
When you have moms who lick and
groom their kids an awful lot,

01:34:23.500 --> 01:34:27.110
what you do is produce the
same sort of better outcome.

01:34:27.110 --> 01:34:29.690
From the three minutes
of petting deal there,

01:34:29.690 --> 01:34:32.740
you get the kid who is
bigger, and healthier,

01:34:32.740 --> 01:34:34.240
and smarter, that sort of thing.

01:34:34.240 --> 01:34:37.090
Moms who hardly ever lick
and groom their pups,

01:34:37.090 --> 01:34:38.950
they produce pups
that, as adults,

01:34:38.950 --> 01:34:40.500
are like the ones
that were separated

01:34:40.500 --> 01:34:42.200
for an hour and a half a day.

01:34:42.200 --> 01:34:45.580
It is a reflection
of mothering style

01:34:45.580 --> 01:34:48.890
in the rats and the
variability there.

01:34:48.890 --> 01:34:53.920
Next thing he showed was that
this was multigenerational.

01:34:53.920 --> 01:34:58.700
If you lick and groom your
baby rat daughter a whole lot,

01:34:58.700 --> 01:35:02.740
as an adult, she will be
more of a licker and groomer.

01:35:02.740 --> 01:35:05.920
And he's already shown what some
of the neurological mechanisms

01:35:05.920 --> 01:35:06.655
are for that.

01:35:06.655 --> 01:35:08.570
For development,
what have we got?

01:35:08.570 --> 01:35:12.600
Yet again, one of these
non-Mendelian inheritance

01:35:12.600 --> 01:35:14.700
of traits deals going on.

01:35:14.700 --> 01:35:16.790
In this case, not even prenatal.

01:35:16.790 --> 01:35:20.780
Your early experience is going
to cause lifelong changes

01:35:20.780 --> 01:35:22.700
in your brain, which
will make you more

01:35:22.700 --> 01:35:25.610
likely to reproduce the
same early experience

01:35:25.610 --> 01:35:26.650
for your offspring.

01:35:26.650 --> 01:35:27.900
Off you go.

01:35:27.900 --> 01:35:30.030
The final thing he
did, which stands

01:35:30.030 --> 01:35:33.360
as a landmark in the field
of behavioral neurobiology,

01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:37.420
is he figured out what
the epigenetic change is.

01:35:37.420 --> 01:35:39.710
One of them, or
rather two of them

01:35:39.710 --> 01:35:42.980
is identified by now,
what gets changed

01:35:42.980 --> 01:35:46.670
by how mom often or
un-often licks you,

01:35:46.670 --> 01:35:48.150
grooms you, all of that?

01:35:48.150 --> 01:35:51.520
You change the access
of transcription factors

01:35:51.520 --> 01:35:57.420
relevant to activating
genes for making receptors

01:35:57.420 --> 01:36:02.350
for stress hormones, making
receptors for estrogen,

01:36:02.350 --> 01:36:05.570
making receptors for a whole
bunch of different hormones.

01:36:05.570 --> 01:36:08.240
Showing the epigenetic
changes there,

01:36:08.240 --> 01:36:12.340
that's how you go from moms
differing maternal style

01:36:12.340 --> 01:36:15.170
to lifelong differences
in expression

01:36:15.170 --> 01:36:17.840
of all sorts of genes.

01:36:17.840 --> 01:36:19.060
How's this?

01:36:19.060 --> 01:36:23.050
What you wind up seeing there
as this permanent mechanism,

01:36:23.050 --> 01:36:26.350
it is also reversible,
what he has since shown,

01:36:26.350 --> 01:36:28.570
which is you have a
baby rat who spends

01:36:28.570 --> 01:36:31.500
the first half of its
infancy with some totally

01:36:31.500 --> 01:36:35.446
terrible, negligent, distracted
mom who pays no attention

01:36:35.446 --> 01:36:36.570
and doesn't do any licking.

01:36:36.570 --> 01:36:41.110
Now cross-foster the pup
to a more attentive mother,

01:36:41.110 --> 01:36:44.380
and you can change the
epigenetic pattern.

01:36:44.380 --> 01:36:47.560
So all of this has
two themes going on.

01:36:47.560 --> 01:36:51.510
Early experience, causing
really persistent differences

01:36:51.510 --> 01:36:53.770
in how this stuff
works long after,

01:36:53.770 --> 01:36:57.630
and experience later on having
the potential to reverse

01:36:57.630 --> 01:36:58.320
some of this.

01:36:58.320 --> 01:37:02.520
All of this stuff, once again,
would be mistaken for genetic.

01:37:02.520 --> 01:37:04.590
What we have here
is what appears

01:37:04.590 --> 01:37:08.960
to be a genetic style of what
sort of mother rat you are.

01:37:08.960 --> 01:37:12.140
And it's not genes,
it's the mothering style

01:37:12.140 --> 01:37:15.860
setting up the offspring for
being a similar type of mother.

01:37:15.860 --> 01:37:18.910
Incredibly important
studies demonstrating this.

01:37:18.910 --> 01:37:21.460
What remains unclear
is how you get

01:37:21.460 --> 01:37:24.980
from mom licking you to
something epigenetic happening

01:37:24.980 --> 01:37:25.610
here.

01:37:25.610 --> 01:37:27.720
His crew is pounding
away at that.

01:37:27.720 --> 01:37:29.370
OK, so what have we
got at this point?

01:37:29.370 --> 01:37:31.680
We have gone through
over and over here--

01:37:31.680 --> 01:37:33.460
where have we gotten
to at this point?

01:37:33.460 --> 01:37:37.770
We've gone over and over here at
all of the classical techniques

01:37:37.770 --> 01:37:39.760
in the field of
behavior genetics,

01:37:39.760 --> 01:37:43.180
does it run in families,
adoptive studies,

01:37:43.180 --> 01:37:46.020
identical versus
monozygotic twins,

01:37:46.020 --> 01:37:47.190
twins separated at birth.

01:37:47.190 --> 01:37:49.090
We saw all of the
problems with it.

01:37:49.090 --> 01:37:52.130
And most dramatically,
most excitingly these days,

01:37:52.130 --> 01:37:54.130
prenatal environmental effects.

01:37:54.130 --> 01:37:57.940
We saw that trying to separate
maternal prenatal effects

01:37:57.940 --> 01:38:00.120
from paternal
genetic effects hits

01:38:00.120 --> 01:38:03.020
a wall, when you get all
of these weird-o hereditary

01:38:03.020 --> 01:38:06.910
things, including potentially
non-genetic Lamarckian

01:38:06.910 --> 01:38:08.380
inheritance of a trait.

01:38:08.380 --> 01:38:12.130
And what we've seen is how this
stuff playing out early in life

01:38:12.130 --> 01:38:14.560
has multigenerational
consequences.

01:38:14.560 --> 01:38:16.920
What we're going to pick
up with on Wednesday

01:38:16.920 --> 01:38:19.790
is now looking at how
people in this business

01:38:19.790 --> 01:38:24.140
find the actual genes, and
ultimately, gene environment

01:38:24.140 --> 01:38:28.630
interactions that make the last
two hours basically irrelevant.

01:38:28.630 --> 01:38:30.490
OK.

01:38:30.490 --> 01:38:33.760
