00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.465
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:08.230
Stanford University.

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:09.930
Is this on?

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.770
Yes.

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:14.350
Well, congratulations.

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.000
Everybody has survived
the midterm including

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.630
the TAs so far, who
recently have been let out

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.020
of their entombment
with thousands

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.600
of pages of exam pages.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:33.870
So those are rolling along,
and everybody is still awake

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:34.831
so that's good.

00:00:34.831 --> 00:00:35.330
OK.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.000
So we have now
officially entered

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.190
the second half of the course.

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.560
And organizational
things-- readings

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.341
will now be read hopefully.

00:00:46.341 --> 00:00:46.840
OK.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.850
So that's not useful.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:49.430
Books.

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.929
Books.

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:52.080
Now is a good time to
actually go and start

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.280
reading those books.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.150
And again, if you are not
up to all of both of them,

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.220
some recommend the
chapters have come along.

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:01.720
Pay attention to those.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.650
And again, a subset of you-- may
not know it yet, but about 25%

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.470
of you will have your life
transformed by that chaos book,

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.760
whereas 25% will resent
the purchase price

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.180
and my forcing you to do this.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.970
Also, another major,
major transition here,

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.100
which is, as far as I can
tell so far, I have run out

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.870
of steam turning
the extended notes

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.860
into actual expository
writing, so they're just

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.580
going to take the form of really
poorly organized outlines.

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:32.860
So that happens.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.270
OK.

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.860
What else?

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.990
What we now
transition to is going

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.790
to be our strategy for the
rest of our course, which

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.805
is to look at various subjects.

00:01:42.805 --> 00:01:46.460
And coming down the pike after
the lectures today and Friday

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.710
on sexual behavior will be
aggression, competition,

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.050
cooperation, empathy,
potentially language

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:56.794
use, schizophrenia.

00:01:56.794 --> 00:01:58.210
Somewhere in there,
there is going

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.120
to be a week or so
on that chaos stuff.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.270
But for all of
these subjects, we

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.580
are now going to follow
the general strategy.

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.259
We will start off looking
at what the behavior is.

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.100
And what we're going
to try to do there,

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.860
in addition to looking at in
lots of different species,

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.130
is to be as objective as
any good old ethologist

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.280
in considering the
fixed action patterns

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.520
of the particular behavior.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.320
That established, with the
promise that, in lots of cases,

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.340
what we think comprise
some of these behaviors

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:29.970
turn out not to be the case.

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.770
That established,
what we will start

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.910
is our inexorable march to
the left, the timeline that

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.780
constitutes everything
we learn now,

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.880
stepping back and saying, OK.

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.400
One millisecond before
that behavior occurred,

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.270
what was going on in the brain?

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:46.610
What parts of the brain?

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.380
What neurotransmitters?

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.730
All of that.

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.480
Stepping back before that, a
second before, a minute before,

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.390
whatever, what was
it in the environment

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.290
that triggered the brain
to produce that behavior?

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.960
What was the acute
releasing stimulus?

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:06.920
Stepping back, what do
hormone levels that hour,

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.770
that day, some such
time span of that,

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:14.400
what acute hormonal exposure
had to do with sensitizing you

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.920
to the environmental
stimulus which

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.970
released the nervous system
into generating the behavior.

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.850
Marching all the way back, throw
in culture some place or other.

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.320
Perinatal effects, early
developmental hormonal stuff,

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.290
eventually considering what do
the genetics of the individual,

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.150
of the population, of
the species-- evolution

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.050
kicking in there
some place or other--

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:40.460
what do all of these things
and something having to do

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:42.780
with ecology thrown in
there just for good measure.

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.600
Working our way back
in each of these cases,

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.450
understanding what was
the biology of one second

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.050
before, one minute, one hour,
one million years before that

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:54.240
gave rise to it.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.720
Back to our two major
themes from day one,

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.110
we are now about to be
unbound, unfettered,

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.190
by our buckets, our
categorical buckets,

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.020
and instead explore
their interactions.

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.740
The other being that notion
from the very first class, which

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:12.810
is that any given
point, if we're

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.350
talking about chronic
hormonal effects

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.709
on this behavior, what
we're talking about

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.709
is the way those hormone
patterns were shaped

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:23.880
during this period,
the way genes

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.860
contributed to the
enzymes that make

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.680
the hormones, the receptors.

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.130
The second you're talking
about genetics, all of this

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:32.400
is becoming apparent.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.430
At every one of these
points, whatever

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.670
point we are talking
about is going

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:39.890
to be the end product of
everything to the left

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:43.176
and just as temporary sort
of footing before going

00:04:43.176 --> 00:04:44.300
to the things on the right.

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.490
So this will be our
strategy forever after now.

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.720
So we start off doing
this with looking

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.994
at sexual behavior,
the neurobiology,

00:04:53.994 --> 00:04:56.285
the endocrinology, the early
experiences, et cetera, et

00:04:56.285 --> 00:04:57.120
cetera.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.740
So to inaugurate the second
half of the course and the fact

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.440
that it's starting off with
lectures on sexual behavior,

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.960
it has to start off with the
stupid obligatory sex joke.

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.170
OK.

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:11.450
So the Martians come to
Earth, and they turn out

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:13.440
to be great guys.

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:14.770
They are really terrific.

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.690
They get along wonderfully
with Earthlings.

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:18.490
All of them like
each other a lot.

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.140
They're all becoming
great friends.

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:23.980
They pass their hours learning
about each other's planets.

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:25.610
What's the weather like there?

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:27.440
What are sports like here?

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:28.445
What are recipes?

00:05:28.445 --> 00:05:30.070
Everybody's getting
along terrifically.

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:32.257
And eventually, the
Earthlings and the Martians

00:05:32.257 --> 00:05:34.340
are getting along well
enough that they get around

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:37.230
to asking the question that
everybody is really interested

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:41.620
in, which is, well, how do you
folks go about reproducing?

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:42.780
So the decision was made.

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.420
The Martians are
going to go first.

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:48.050
So they clear out a big space,
and a whole bunch of Martians

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:51.120
come in there and they stand
on top of each other heads,

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.500
and their noses flash
different colors,

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.402
and steam comes out
of various orifices,

00:05:56.402 --> 00:05:58.110
and there's clanking
noises and whatever.

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:00.560
And out pops a new
little Martian.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:04.190
And the Earthlings say,
wow, that was great.

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:05.310
Love the concept.

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:07.021
And I got great video of that.

00:06:07.021 --> 00:06:08.520
And that's terrific
and all of that.

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:09.019
OK

00:06:09.019 --> 00:06:09.990
So that's worked out.

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:11.760
And now it's the humans turn.

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:15.390
So a willing couple is found,
and some space is cleared out.

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:18.030
And the Martians sit down
there with their video cameras

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:18.800
as well.

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.470
And clicking away.

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:21.920
And this couple goes at it.

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:24.990
And they finish the whole thing
in a sweaty mess at the end.

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:26.960
And the Martian say,
that's wonderful.

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.200
That's so interesting.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.844
You Earthlings are just endless.

00:06:29.844 --> 00:06:31.260
And the fascinating
things you do,

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:35.000
but we have one question
though, which is,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.990
so where's the new human?

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:39.570
And they said, oh,
that takes nine months.

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:44.040
They say, well, why were they
in such a rush at the end?

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:47.870
So our first question
here is, why were they

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:49.480
in such a rush at the end?

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:49.980
OK.

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:51.290
Three possible answers.

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:53.660
Choice number
one-- vote for it--

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:55.630
why were they in such
a rush at the end?

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:58.410
Number one, because they
were acting with this fervent

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:02.110
desire to do something for
the good of the species.

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:03.920
Just seeing if any hands go up.

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:04.960
That's a good thing.

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:08.605
Option number two,
doing that because you

00:07:08.605 --> 00:07:10.730
want to maximize the number
of copies of your genes

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:12.460
passed on to the
next generation.

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:16.240
Option number three,
because it feels good.

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:16.740
OK.

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:17.890
One hand goes up.

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:20.130
And I'm not sure what that
indicates about everyone,

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:24.380
but I will remind you from
the survey in the first class

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:26.650
there that a far greater
percentage of you

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:29.220
want to learn about depression
than about sexual behavior.

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:32.131
So there you have it with
the Stanford experience.

00:07:32.131 --> 00:07:32.630
OK.

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:34.850
Because it feels good.

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:37.310
And what we deal with
here right off the start

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:42.460
is this important dichotomy
between proximal and distal

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:44.330
explanations for behavior.

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:46.780
Explanation, a
distal explanation,

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:48.930
for sexual behavior,
parentheses,

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:50.900
why were they in such
a rush at the end?

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:53.080
Passing on copies of
your genes, the effects

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.260
of hormones, and
certain reward pathways

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:56.490
in the brain, all of that.

00:07:56.490 --> 00:08:00.670
Proximal mechanism being
that it feels good.

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:02.840
And starting off right
off the bat the thing

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:04.860
to make sense of
with sexual behavior

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:08.930
is it is driven by this
amazing little loop here

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:12.290
of sensory stimuli,
and feedback,

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:16.680
and immediate sensations that
drive the behavior coming out.

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:20.440
And all this stuff down here
is for the doctoral thesis

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:21.870
somewhere down the line.

00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:24.010
That's not what
the motivation is.

00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:27.100
Probably more than any other of
the behaviors we will look at,

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:30.280
the driving forces are
very proximal ones.

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:33.730
Nobody sits there and figures
out how many copies of genes

00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:37.220
they are passing on and thus are
willing to speed up to produce

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:39.150
a new human nine months later.

00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:42.030
It is instead, in
species after species,

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:44.720
it is proximal
motivating mechanisms

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:46.800
for generating the behaviors.

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:47.460
OK.

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:49.740
So beginning to look at
the actual behaviors,

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:53.680
there is a funny duality to
making sense of sexual behavior

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:57.180
across different species,
a funny sort of contrast.

00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:02.280
The first one being that, well,
all species go about sex--

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:05.190
or all vertebrate
species go about sex

00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:07.570
in a roughly similar way.

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:10.590
Yet, you don't want to be
too similar to the species

00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:11.550
next door.

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:13.890
There's an interesting
sort of dichotomy there.

00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:17.570
All sorts of vertebrate
species are doing things

00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:21.520
with pelvic thrusting
and orgasms and-- hey,

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:24.630
stay tuned that's
coming-- and ejaculation,

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:27.220
and lordotic reflexes,
and things of that sort.

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:32.280
Highly conserved fixed action
patterns across lots and lots

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:33.500
of different species.

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:36.830
None the less, amid that,
you've got this other problem,

00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:40.440
which is you want to have these
fixed action patterns being

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:42.940
specific to your species.

00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:44.690
You do not want to mess up.

00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:46.800
So there is this
strange simultaneity

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:50.910
of very, very conserved
basic building

00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:53.980
blocks of the fixed action
patterns of sexual behavior.

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:58.880
But along with that, a lot of
selectivity within species.

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:01.300
Now how does that
selectivity begin to work?

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:04.870
What you get is this very
interesting interplay,

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:09.130
this intercalation, between the
releasing stimuli and the fixed

00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:10.230
action pattern.

00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:13.175
What you get is this
chaining of behavior.

00:10:13.175 --> 00:10:16.620
In other words, the fixed
action pattern of one

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:20.580
of the individuals constitutes
the releasing stimulus

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:23.840
for the other individual's
fixed action pattern, which

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:27.410
constitutes the releasing
stimulus for this individual's

00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:28.810
fixed action pattern.

00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:31.880
This chaining of
transitions there,

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:34.180
of interplay between
these two, which

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:37.560
is where you get the
species specificity from.

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:38.420
OK.

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:40.820
So in terms of making
sense of that, of course,

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:44.340
any of this in terms of looking
at the general features of how

00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:47.300
to think about sexual behavior
across species, of course, what

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:51.670
you have to have out the wazoo
is your basic ethology credo

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:53.910
of interviewing an animal
in its own language

00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:56.220
about its sexual
behavior, wonderfully

00:10:56.220 --> 00:11:00.000
summarized in this quote by
Martha McClintock, researcher.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.800
I think I've used
this quote already,

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:03.780
which is, in her
particular case,

00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:07.370
studying female rat sexual
behavior, which turns out

00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:09.550
to be this very ornate
process involving

00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:11.930
a lot of running around
on the part of the female.

00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:15.300
Studying female rat
sexual behavior in a cage

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:18.640
is like trying to study swimming
behavior of a dolphin in a bath

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:19.270
tub.

00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:21.670
You need to get it in
the natural setting,

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:24.430
or else you are going to
lose all sorts of insight.

00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:27.770
In the particular realm of
female rat sexual behavior,

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:30.500
the standard picture
for decades and decades,

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:33.420
the centuries where our
finest minds have looked

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:35.980
at rats having sex,
the standard dogma

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:40.550
has been that the female role
is a very passive receptive one.

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:42.572
And it turns out it's a
very passive receptive

00:11:42.572 --> 00:11:44.030
one if she doesn't
have enough room

00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:46.930
to run around and do all sorts
of courting stuff on her own,

00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:51.620
all sorts of proceptive sexual
behaviors, which she can't see,

00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:54.500
if you're studying an animal
in a setting where they can't

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:56.390
speak in their own language.

00:11:56.390 --> 00:12:00.180
So a big, big vote for
ethological logical principles

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:01.690
when it comes to this.

00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:02.340
All right.

00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:05.250
So just to get some jargon
under our belt right

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:08.020
from the start here, in terms
of how the professionals talk

00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:10.160
about sex when they're
talking about sex

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:11.920
and trying to sound
like professionals,

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:13.570
here are some of the terms.

00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:16.240
Old outdated term,
Freudian term,

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:20.220
that nonetheless has
entered the general world

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:25.110
of referring to sexual arousal
and motivation-- libido.

00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:28.790
Libido, as we will see that
commonplace everyday usage

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:33.040
term, is perhaps more
technically described

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:34.400
as horniness.

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:37.070
But it can also be
described as one term

00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:39.910
within a trio of the terms
that people in the business

00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:45.230
really use most frequently--
attractivity, proceptivity,

00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:46.870
and receptivity.

00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:50.120
Quick, get to work on poems
about those three terms.

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:52.970
But what you've got
here is attractivity,

00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:57.090
how attractive an individual
is to someone else.

00:12:57.090 --> 00:13:00.380
Receptivity, how
receptive that individual

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:03.550
is to the interest of
the other individual.

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:07.330
Proceptivity, the
active behaviors

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:11.140
that are carried out in
response to being attracted to.

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:13.780
And thus, you could say
because of the attractiveness

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:16.150
of this organism,
this other organism

00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:18.970
began proceptive behaviors
which did or did not

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:22.710
prove to meet with receptive
fixed action patterns

00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:23.800
and responses.

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:25.730
The very words any
of us would use

00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:27.590
to describe what
goes on at a party.

00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:28.090
OK.

00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:30.450
So we've got that triad
there, the terms that

00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:34.470
are much more in common than
terms like libido or arousal

00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:35.610
or motivation.

00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:37.270
These are the more common ones.

00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:40.400
What is another realm, in
terms that are much more used,

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:43.020
these are much
more zoology terms.

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:45.410
What's used far more
often in clinical medicine

00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:49.140
is a description, a
dichotomy, between motivation

00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:50.790
and performance.

00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:54.330
And that is never used more
frequently than in the realm

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:56.650
of making sense of
sexual motivation

00:13:56.650 --> 00:14:00.440
in men as dissociable
from erectile function

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:03.820
versus dysfunction,
motivation being very, very

00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:06.190
different from performance.

00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:08.760
So that's another
realm of distinctions.

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:12.770
Other realms as well--
desire, orgasms, arousal,

00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:14.480
all sorts of commonplace terms.

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:17.590
The performance versus
motivation dichotomy

00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:21.400
and the proceptivity,
receptivity, [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:24.050
are the major terms
that are used.

00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:26.220
Next issue, in terms
of getting to this,

00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:28.770
how do people find
out information

00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:30.360
about sexual behavior?

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:33.230
One option is to sit there
with night viewing goggles.

00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:35.460
And that's very useful
for nocturnal species.

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:38.470
But how do people find out
about human sexual behavior?

00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:40.590
All sorts of ways
over the years,

00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:42.580
starting with anonymous
questionnaires.

00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:47.370
But a really clever technique
was worked out in the 1980s.

00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:50.080
A biological mathematician
named Joel Cohen

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:52.830
getting at how to get
people to tell you

00:14:52.830 --> 00:14:56.350
about very embarrassing things
about their sexual lives.

00:14:56.350 --> 00:15:00.210
And this was prompted in the
80s when AIDS first swept in,

00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:04.560
and it was wildly,
wildly taboo at the time

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:06.920
in virtually every
corner of this country

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:10.350
to admit to having a less
than standard, white bread

00:15:10.350 --> 00:15:11.950
sexual orientation.

00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:15.220
Take a look at the extended
notes to see the trick

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:18.480
that Joel Cohen came up
with, a very clever device

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:21.250
in order to figure out
what percentage of people

00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:24.540
are doing what sexually
without asking anybody

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:27.030
to give an answer that
they would find, perhaps,

00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:31.650
to be embarrassing or grounds
for all sorts of persecution.

00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:32.660
OK.

00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:36.660
So beginning to look at
aspects of behavior and other

00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:40.060
features of the rightmost
end of all of this.

00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:43.360
We start off with the
most central puzzle

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:46.590
in making sense of any of
this stuff, which is, so

00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:49.640
what's up with female orgasms?

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:53.090
And we've got right off
the bat the simple problem

00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:56.930
of making sense of this
biological phenomenon and one

00:15:56.930 --> 00:15:59.950
where fertility is
not dependent on it.

00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:03.260
One does not need to have
orgasms to become pregnant,

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:06.400
to give birth, to pass
on copies of one's genes.

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:08.160
So what's the deal with orgasms?

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:10.380
First off, a question
we will wind up

00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:13.310
asking with a whole lot of the
behavior coming down the line

00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:16.050
is, are we the only species?

00:16:16.050 --> 00:16:18.320
And all sorts of
careful studies have

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:21.010
shown that we are
not the only species.

00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:24.310
Other apes, other
primate species, as well

00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:28.110
monkeys and apes, show
orgasm among the females.

00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:31.450
And that is detectable by
all sorts of physiology

00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:32.780
we'll hear about in a while.

00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:34.590
We are not the only species.

00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:37.480
One of the really
bizarre, pathetic things

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:39.650
about trying to do
research in this area

00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:43.060
was one of the first papers
that ever demonstrated something

00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:46.860
which physiologically was
identical to female orgasm

00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:49.680
in rhesus monkey
females, which wound up

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:51.800
being a paper in
this journal Science.

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:53.590
Down there in the
footnotes, the authors

00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:58.100
had to indicate this did not
make use of any federal grant

00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:00.420
money to carry out the study.

00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:03.430
Just to give you a sense of
where some of the stuff sits.

00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:03.930
OK.

00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:06.339
So what's up with female orgasm?

00:17:06.339 --> 00:17:09.609
It is not necessary
for conception.

00:17:09.609 --> 00:17:12.140
It is not necessary to
increase the number of copies

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:14.099
of your genes in
future generations.

00:17:14.099 --> 00:17:16.690
Despite that, there
is some evidence

00:17:16.690 --> 00:17:20.119
that it facilitates
fertilization.

00:17:20.119 --> 00:17:22.930
And the technical term that's
always been given for that

00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:26.319
is, bizarrely
enough, facilitation.

00:17:26.319 --> 00:17:30.120
The notion is something about
the vaginal fluid, something

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:34.780
about the biochemistry of,
increases sperm motility.

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:39.590
Sperm swim faster and harder
and jump upstream back to spawn

00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:41.540
or whatever it is
the sperm are doing

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:45.330
with more avidity, with
more energetic displays,

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:49.220
in an environment of
more vaginal secretion.

00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:52.210
And orgasm greatly
increases that.

00:17:52.210 --> 00:17:54.980
So the argument there
being that orgasm

00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:58.970
facilitates fertilization
through the sperm facilitation

00:17:58.970 --> 00:17:59.980
process.

00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:02.650
Evidence for that has always
been a little bit indirect.

00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:05.810
It is not airtight
that that happens.

00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:09.490
Another argument for why
this increases fertility.

00:18:09.490 --> 00:18:13.770
And this is sort of
an interesting one.

00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:16.760
And the notion here is that
what an orgasm does is,

00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:19.360
among other things,
exhausts you enormously,

00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:21.380
causing you to be
far more likely to be

00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:24.610
horizontal than vertical
shortly thereafter, and thus,

00:18:24.610 --> 00:18:27.190
facilitating fertilization
because the sperm don't

00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:30.580
have to swim straight
up against gravity.

00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:31.540
I kid you not.

00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:33.920
This is one of the
leading models out there.

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:37.200
Then there's the orgasm
facilitates female conception

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:40.050
out of reinforcement
theory, which is back

00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:43.237
to the it feels good and thus
you are more likely to do it

00:18:43.237 --> 00:18:45.570
again and increasing the
likelihood of passing on copies

00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:46.290
of your genes.

00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:47.580
All of this is wonderful.

00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:49.960
All of these possible
mechanisms where,

00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:54.070
even though female orgasm is
not necessary for conception,

00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:57.160
it nonetheless increases
the likelihood of.

00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:58.510
That's great.

00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:01.010
However, what most of
the studies have shown,

00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:03.250
though, is there
is no relationship

00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:06.400
between the fertility of
a woman and her propensity

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:07.680
towards orgasm.

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:11.010
It does not seem to play
out in so far as any

00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:13.690
of this facilitation
or horizontal

00:19:13.690 --> 00:19:17.630
swim enhancement techniques
or whatever actually occurs--

00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:20.370
these are not big enough
of effects to actually make

00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:23.580
a difference in terms
of reproductive success.

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:24.370
So what else?

00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:25.570
What else is known about it?

00:19:25.570 --> 00:19:28.020
There is a certain
degree of heritability,

00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:31.420
of propensity towards
orgasm in females.

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:34.050
And this is shown with
all our standard behavior

00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:37.340
genetics techniques in
terms of comparing dizygotic

00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:39.280
versus monozygotic twins.

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:43.170
We know what to do in terms
of not overvaluing findings

00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:43.980
like those.

00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:46.140
Nonetheless, they are there.

00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:50.510
So if a basic puzzle is,
why do females have orgasms

00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:53.210
if it's not necessary for
conception and, in fact,

00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:56.180
the evidence is not great
that it even facilitates it,

00:19:56.180 --> 00:19:58.410
why on top of all of
that, why such things

00:19:58.410 --> 00:20:01.930
as clitoral orgasms, which
the studies generally show

00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:03.690
are more easily
brought about than

00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:06.360
are vaginal ones,
what's up with that?

00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:07.890
Even more the same question.

00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:10.000
Now somewhere in
there is a lurking

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.550
the heart breaking
possibility in making

00:20:12.550 --> 00:20:16.790
sense of why female orgasm
exists the dreadful possibility

00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:20.150
that what we're dealing
with here is a spandrel.

00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:22.030
And that it is a spandrel.

00:20:22.030 --> 00:20:24.440
It is simply baggage
brought along

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:28.940
that those guys have to go
through this orgasm physiology

00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:32.390
to do any stuff with sperm
and pass on copies of genes

00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:33.380
and all of that.

00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:36.900
And it's simply baggage
that the same physiology

00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:38.240
occurs in females.

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:42.860
That orgasm is simply
a spandrel in women.

00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:46.100
And the counter scenario
that's always given

00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:48.960
is, this is exactly
equivalent to the notion

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:51.730
that nipples are
spandrels in men,

00:20:51.730 --> 00:20:54.960
in that women, female
mammals, need to go about all

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:56.380
this lactation business.

00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:58.740
And that's part of the
whole package deal.

00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:03.470
And just as it would be way
too much work to evolve females

00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:05.410
without orgasms,
it would be way too

00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:07.770
much to get rid of those
useless nipples on men.

00:21:07.770 --> 00:21:08.270
OK.

00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:09.660
Let's have a quick survey.

00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:11.360
Yes?

00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:12.842
So could a lot of
those questions

00:21:12.842 --> 00:21:15.686
also be applied to why
do male have orgasms?

00:21:15.686 --> 00:21:18.060
Because ejaculation can
occur without orgasm.

00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:18.650
OK.

00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:21.020
So why do males have orgasms?

00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:25.590
Ejaculation can occur--
it is far more voluminous

00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:27.320
in the face of an orgasm.

00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:31.810
So that's easily framed in
terms of an adaptive mechanism.

00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:32.350
OK.

00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:33.890
Quick survey here.

00:21:33.890 --> 00:21:37.370
How many people--
OK, how many guys

00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:39.490
who have those useless
nipples, how many of you

00:21:39.490 --> 00:21:42.496
go for the nipple as
spandrel in guys theory?

00:21:46.001 --> 00:21:46.500
Whoa.

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:48.370
Is that slow in the hands?

00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:48.920
OK.

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:50.325
Should I raise my hand?

00:21:50.325 --> 00:21:51.450
Should I not raise my hand?

00:21:51.450 --> 00:21:53.440
OK.

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:56.300
Women in the room, how many
go for the female orgasm

00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:58.700
is merely spandrel theory?

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:05.640
If I recall, there was one other
question somewhere a few weeks

00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:07.840
back that only got one
person fessing up to it,

00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:10.110
and it came somewhere
around there also.

00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:12.615
So I don't know if
that's the lighting

00:22:12.615 --> 00:22:15.270
or if people tend to
sit in the same places.

00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:15.770
OK.

00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:19.690
So not a whole lot of enthusiasm
for the spandrel concepts here.

00:22:19.690 --> 00:22:23.510
Nonetheless, that needs to
be seriously entertained.

00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:24.190
OK.

00:22:24.190 --> 00:22:28.410
So now looking at other features
of the fixed action patterns,

00:22:28.410 --> 00:22:30.840
and amid all these
different species

00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:35.460
doing lordotic stuff and
orgasms and ejaculation and all

00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:38.730
of that, what are some of
the realms of sexual behavior

00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:41.460
that are relatively
unique to humans?

00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:44.800
First off, one that used to be
thought to be absolutely unique

00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:47.460
was non-reproductive sex.

00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:50.550
This is a world of difference
than those species where

00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:53.910
the female ovulates for like
2 and 1/2 hours every year,

00:22:53.910 --> 00:22:55.560
and everybody mates
at that point.

00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:58.600
Or species where
somebody comes into heat,

00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:00.210
a female is in estrus.

00:23:00.210 --> 00:23:03.100
Humans have
non-reproductive sex.

00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:05.550
And that was viewed
as absolutely unique.

00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:08.570
What it is now clear is it
is not completely unique.

00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:10.810
There are lots of
other species that do,

00:23:10.810 --> 00:23:14.910
probably most famously bonobo
chimps and various cetaceans

00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:15.610
like dolphins.

00:23:15.610 --> 00:23:19.490
Nonetheless, it is certainly
a specialty among humans.

00:23:19.490 --> 00:23:20.490
What else?

00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:24.750
Foreplay, that used to be in the
category of human specialties.

00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:28.140
And it is clear by now that
bonobo chimps, for example,

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:30.960
have vastly more
patience with foreplay

00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:32.210
than average humans do.

00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:34.960
We are not the only
species with that either.

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:37.430
Huge, huge controversy.

00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:42.070
How unique is homosexuality
to human behavior?

00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:43.520
Human sexual behavior?

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:47.170
And what's clear increasingly
is we're not the only species

00:23:47.170 --> 00:23:48.260
with that either.

00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:52.250
The original view, when people
would view homosexual behavior,

00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:55.040
male-male, female-female,
in other species,

00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:57.010
it would be animals
in captivity.

00:23:57.010 --> 00:23:58.800
And it would be
the, why is there

00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:01.610
so much homosexuality
in prisons argument--

00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:02.980
lack of alternatives.

00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:06.030
This was not normal,
natural behavior.

00:24:06.030 --> 00:24:08.660
What is clear from
ethological field studies

00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:11.060
is we are by no means
the only species

00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:12.960
to have homosexual behavior.

00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:14.140
What else?

00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:17.560
One of the things that we do
seem to be fairly unique about

00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:21.450
is having egalitarian
sex, which is

00:24:21.450 --> 00:24:24.770
to say that there are
no human cultures where

00:24:24.770 --> 00:24:28.820
as part of the central
tenets of that culture people

00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:31.860
are restricted, only a
subset of individuals

00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:33.490
are allowed to reproduce.

00:24:33.490 --> 00:24:35.280
And this is a
world of difference

00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:36.500
from various species.

00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:39.280
For example, New World
monkeys, marmosets,

00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:42.280
where it is only one
male and one female

00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:44.400
in a group that does
the reproducing.

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:49.780
Instead, humans in every culture
ever seen have egalitarian sex.

00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:50.580
What else?

00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:52.340
What else is highly human?

00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:54.560
People used to
think exclusively so

00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:56.950
this endless quest for variety.

00:24:56.950 --> 00:24:59.560
And again, just take a look
at these bonobo chimps,

00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:02.510
and you'll see how small minded
we are when it comes to this.

00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:04.160
But something else
that is indeed

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:06.960
unique to human sexual
behavior is the notion

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:09.550
that this is something
you do in private.

00:25:09.550 --> 00:25:14.440
There is no other species where
the majority of sexual behavior

00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:17.820
is conducted intentionally
outside the sight of everybody

00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:18.380
else.

00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:21.050
That is rather unique to humans.

00:25:21.050 --> 00:25:23.380
What else about
human sexual behavior

00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:25.605
seems to be specializations?

00:25:25.605 --> 00:25:29.120
One that is fairly unique,
if not entirely so,

00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:33.120
is the subset of humans who
psychopathological confuse

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:34.970
sexual behavior with violence.

00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:37.890
And that seems not to have
a whole lot of precedence.

00:25:37.890 --> 00:25:40.930
So immediately one
asks other domains.

00:25:40.930 --> 00:25:45.060
Masturbation, that is not
remotely a human specialty.

00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:47.330
That has all sorts of
other species as well.

00:25:47.330 --> 00:25:49.910
And that used to get the,
well, what else is there

00:25:49.910 --> 00:25:53.460
to do when you're sitting in
the zoo-- for the animals-- what

00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:54.640
else is there to do?

00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:56.060
It is not natural.

00:25:56.060 --> 00:25:57.720
It is a default whatever.

00:25:57.720 --> 00:25:59.420
But looking out
in the real world,

00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:01.350
and there is plenty of that.

00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:04.410
And one of the most like
implausible suggestions

00:26:04.410 --> 00:26:07.130
for an adaptive
just so story thing

00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:09.640
is, why do male
primates masturbate

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:11.280
to the point of ejaculation?

00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:13.470
They tend to eat
the semen afterward.

00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:14.310
Whoa!

00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:18.070
Great source of protein,
go the adaptationists.

00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:20.880
Everything has an
adaptive basis.

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:24.040
This one does not ring
terribly true to me.

00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:25.380
What else?

00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:25.940
Fantasy.

00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:28.420
Fantasy in humans, is
that unique to humans?

00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:30.710
Obviously, we haven't a clue.

00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:33.380
But here's one suggestion to
me that this is not actually

00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:33.900
the case.

00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:37.290
And this was years ago where
I was watching my baboons,

00:26:37.290 --> 00:26:40.020
and there was this
one low ranking kid,

00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:43.240
this snivelly adolescent kid,
where the nearest thing he has

00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:45.080
ever gotten to a
female in his life

00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:48.460
with some high ranking female
in a bad mood beating on him.

00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:50.600
And he's sitting there
minding his own business.

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:54.020
And along comes, I think by
any baboon male standards,

00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:58.480
the hottest female in the troop,
who has a peek estrus swelling,

00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:00.450
is no doubt ovulating that day.

00:27:00.450 --> 00:27:02.630
Comes walking along,
followed two feet

00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:04.720
behind by the huge
menacing male,

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:06.420
who was in the
consortship with her.

00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:09.779
And our guy just sits there
and doesn't even quite

00:27:09.779 --> 00:27:10.820
look at what's happening.

00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:13.430
Every now and then, his eyes
go up, watching them go past.

00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:16.190
And as she walks past,
he gets an erection

00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:19.540
and then goes off
and masturbates.

00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:20.440
OK.

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:22.370
The charming-- I don't
know if this is even

00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:24.100
the word you can use
in this setting--

00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:27.400
but the charming notion is
that we've just seen evidence

00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:31.390
for some sort of internal
fantasy life going on this guy.

00:27:31.390 --> 00:27:31.990
OK.

00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:34.420
You could be a killjoy
instead and say, no, no.

00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:36.860
She was giving off
wafts of pheromones,

00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:38.930
and that was what was
responsible for it.

00:27:38.930 --> 00:27:40.710
Nonetheless this is
about as far as we

00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:42.650
can get at asking this
critical question,

00:27:42.650 --> 00:27:46.870
are we the only species that
does this fantasizing stuff?

00:27:46.870 --> 00:27:48.250
Marriage.

00:27:48.250 --> 00:27:50.780
Clearly, we've heard about
monogamous pair bonding

00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:51.540
species.

00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:55.230
In terms of the formal structure
of marriage, it is universal.

00:27:55.230 --> 00:27:57.960
All human cultures have
some version of it.

00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:01.070
Across all human cultures,
more than 90% of people

00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:03.290
wind up in that
culture's equivalent

00:28:03.290 --> 00:28:06.250
of a permanent,
stable relationship.

00:28:06.250 --> 00:28:08.380
And this is the case
in polygamous cultures.

00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:10.030
We've already heard
that business.

00:28:10.030 --> 00:28:13.620
Even though historically, the
majority of human cultures

00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:16.470
have been polygamous,
nonetheless, amid them,

00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:19.140
the vast majority of
individuals have been

00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:21.370
in monogamous relationships.

00:28:21.370 --> 00:28:24.040
Amid that, nonetheless,
what is also

00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:27.570
clear is amid that highly,
highly prevalent pattern

00:28:27.570 --> 00:28:30.850
of monogamous relationships,
there's a lot less monogamy

00:28:30.850 --> 00:28:32.650
going around than
you would think.

00:28:32.650 --> 00:28:35.960
And this was first sorted
out-- people like Alfred Kinsey

00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:38.420
when first working out
that questionnaire approach

00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:41.010
to people's sexual
behavior, what became clear

00:28:41.010 --> 00:28:45.930
was there is a lot less
faith within pair bonding,

00:28:45.930 --> 00:28:48.690
within humans in this
country and has since

00:28:48.690 --> 00:28:50.870
shown in all sorts
of other societies

00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:52.810
than one would
originally assume.

00:28:52.810 --> 00:28:57.070
There is social monogamy but
not necessarily anywhere near

00:28:57.070 --> 00:29:00.270
as high of rates
of sexual monogamy.

00:29:00.270 --> 00:29:02.440
And what the paternity
studies have shown

00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:05.390
is in most Western
European countries,

00:29:05.390 --> 00:29:07.800
the rate at which children
have been fathered

00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:11.850
by an individual other
than the person claiming

00:29:11.850 --> 00:29:16.720
marriageable credit for doing
so ranges between 10% and 40%

00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:17.940
of children.

00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:20.350
How's that for a number?

00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:21.070
OK.

00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:22.000
What else?

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.900
What else tends to be a feature
of human sexual behavior?

00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:29.875
What you have is, of course,
not only intrinsic in the fact

00:29:29.875 --> 00:29:32.000
that there's a difference
between social and sexual

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:32.800
monogamy.

00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:34.280
You have cheating.

00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:36.840
That is a human specialty
in every culture.

00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:39.850
What else is absolutely
wildly human?

00:29:39.850 --> 00:29:41.730
This notion of romance.

00:29:41.730 --> 00:29:44.610
And romance is,
by most estimates,

00:29:44.610 --> 00:29:48.080
a relatively new invention
in most cultures,

00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:49.910
maybe a couple of centuries old.

00:29:49.910 --> 00:29:52.370
And what is an even
newer invention

00:29:52.370 --> 00:29:55.290
is the notion that romance,
passion, et cetera,

00:29:55.290 --> 00:29:58.910
should persist, should last
throughout the entire duration

00:29:58.910 --> 00:30:00.530
of the lifetime's marriage.

00:30:00.530 --> 00:30:03.020
That is an utterly
novel concept.

00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:05.820
That is perhaps 30,
40, 50 years old

00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:07.740
in most Westernized countries.

00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:09.670
That's a new one as well.

00:30:09.670 --> 00:30:11.410
What that, of
course, ushers in is

00:30:11.410 --> 00:30:12.900
looking at issues of divorce.

00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:16.370
Across all cultures, the
average duration of marriages

00:30:16.370 --> 00:30:18.590
are two to four years.

00:30:18.590 --> 00:30:20.280
And people have
made the argument

00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:24.030
that that is the typical
duration of children being

00:30:24.030 --> 00:30:26.960
dependent on a high
degree of parenting,

00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:28.490
of both parents being around.

00:30:28.490 --> 00:30:32.360
That is the average interbirth
interval, two to four years,

00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:34.430
in most traditional
human cultures.

00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:36.770
What's the term
being described then

00:30:36.770 --> 00:30:39.960
if that is the "natural"
point at which most

00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:43.600
marriages dissolve and turn into
other monogamous relationships?

00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:46.660
The term that is
given is that humans

00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:51.180
tend toward being serial
monogamists, moving from one

00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:55.180
monogamous relationship to
another with, on the average,

00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:59.140
a lag time roughly corresponding
to the interbirth interval.

00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:00.290
So that's charming.

00:31:00.290 --> 00:31:01.510
What else?

00:31:01.510 --> 00:31:02.930
What else do you have?

00:31:02.930 --> 00:31:06.660
All sorts of other aspects
of human sexual variety,

00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:09.430
but ultimately, when you
look at human sexual behavior

00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:13.190
versus other species,
we are so boring.

00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:16.880
We are so limited when you look
at the range of unlikely things

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:18.200
going on out there.

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:22.570
Species that are
regularly hermaphroditic--

00:31:22.570 --> 00:31:24.510
and people, in fact,
have done studies

00:31:24.510 --> 00:31:27.510
on how is it that a
hermaphroditic animal does not

00:31:27.510 --> 00:31:29.020
try to have sex with itself?

00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:31.170
And these are usually
worm type things.

00:31:31.170 --> 00:31:33.520
And that's some version
of an incest avoidance.

00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:36.720
At the same time, there are
other species where individuals

00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:39.030
change sex opportunistically.

00:31:39.030 --> 00:31:41.480
All sorts of fish species
where that happens.

00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:43.980
Lots of species that
are parthenogenetic,

00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:47.970
where an individual reproduces
without the benefit of anybody

00:31:47.970 --> 00:31:49.580
else's genetic input.

00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:53.040
Even stranger, there's a bunch
of snake species that are

00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:56.740
parthenogenic, but the
females cannot reproduce

00:31:56.740 --> 00:32:00.280
parthenogenically unless
they mate with males.

00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:03.050
They do not actually get
any sperm from the males,

00:32:03.050 --> 00:32:05.050
and they get no
genetic contribution,

00:32:05.050 --> 00:32:07.140
but something about
that is necessary

00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:10.780
for the parthenogenetic
event to occur.

00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:11.280
OK.

00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:15.000
So all sorts of bizarrities that
make our fixed action patterns

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.840
look really pretty dull.

00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:19.900
But nonetheless, these are the
backbones of the human fixed

00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:21.970
action patterns,
and some of them

00:32:21.970 --> 00:32:24.160
wildly unique, some
of them far less

00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:26.090
than people used to
think, some of them

00:32:26.090 --> 00:32:28.000
very, very unprecedented.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:28.500
OK.

00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:32.040
So what this allows us to do
now is make our first big step.

00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:33.810
What's going on in the brain?

00:32:33.810 --> 00:32:36.750
What is the neurobiology
of sexual behavior

00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:39.700
producing those fixed
action patterns?

00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:42.730
And what you better bet
right off the bat is we

00:32:42.730 --> 00:32:44.920
are talking about
the limbic system.

00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:46.850
This is all limbic
system until we

00:32:46.850 --> 00:32:49.560
see ways in which it's not
just all the limbic system.

00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:51.810
But it is heavily
centered-- no surprise--

00:32:51.810 --> 00:32:53.000
in the limbic system.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:56.710
And this was being noted
first around the 1930s, 1940s

00:32:56.710 --> 00:33:00.610
with the first experiments where
there were lesion studies done

00:33:00.610 --> 00:33:03.550
damaging different parts of
the limbic system in animals.

00:33:03.550 --> 00:33:06.600
And what would be noted
was animal sexual behavior

00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:07.830
would change.

00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:10.880
And this was eventually
termed a profile,

00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:13.930
termed after the two scientists
who pioneered this stuff called

00:33:13.930 --> 00:33:18.230
the Kluvre-Bucy Syndrome,
which is when you damage some

00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:22.980
of these strange mysterious
rhinencephalonic structures

00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:25.880
in there, you change
the sexual behavior.

00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:28.540
You change, for
example, in monkeys,

00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:32.300
whether they are attempting
to mate with another monkey as

00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:34.080
opposed to an inanimate object.

00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:37.100
They change aspects of
the fixed action patterns

00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:38.430
of the behavior and such.

00:33:38.430 --> 00:33:40.820
And out of it, this was
one of the main driving

00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:44.240
forces on people saying,
nose-brain, well, that's great.

00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:45.850
But actually, what
we're looking at

00:33:45.850 --> 00:33:49.210
is a part of the brain that
has lots to do with emotion

00:33:49.210 --> 00:33:51.320
and emotionally
related behaviors.

00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:53.070
That was one of
the driving forces

00:33:53.070 --> 00:33:56.851
on the limbic system being
pulled together as a concept.

00:33:56.851 --> 00:33:57.350
OK.

00:33:57.350 --> 00:34:00.480
So what areas within the
limbic system are relevant?

00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:03.410
First pass, there are
different hot spots

00:34:03.410 --> 00:34:06.340
in there depending on gender.

00:34:06.340 --> 00:34:09.350
Among females, probably
the most important area

00:34:09.350 --> 00:34:11.820
is a subsection of the
hypothalamus called

00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:14.469
the ventral medial
hypothalamus involved

00:34:14.469 --> 00:34:16.360
in female sexual behavior.

00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:17.960
What's the evidence for that?

00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:20.870
Just go back to last
Friday's lecture--

00:34:20.870 --> 00:34:25.040
lesion studies, stimulation
studies, recording studies.

00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:28.610
Destroy the VMH, you do not
get sexual behavior anymore

00:34:28.610 --> 00:34:29.659
from a female.

00:34:29.659 --> 00:34:32.320
Stimulate it, and you will
get the same behaviors

00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:34.650
that you would normally
only see in an ovulating

00:34:34.650 --> 00:34:36.630
female rat for example.

00:34:36.630 --> 00:34:39.360
All the sorts of
tools we heard about.

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:41.679
Reinforcing this
even more is this

00:34:41.679 --> 00:34:44.730
is the hot spot in the
hypothalamus for receptors

00:34:44.730 --> 00:34:48.179
for estrogen and progesterone.

00:34:48.179 --> 00:34:50.730
So that makes lots of sense.

00:34:50.730 --> 00:34:54.300
Meanwhile, another region of
the brain that is typically

00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:56.469
involved in sexual
behavior in females,

00:34:56.469 --> 00:34:58.150
a region in the midbrain.

00:34:58.150 --> 00:35:01.460
The midbrain, which seems to
have something to do with some

00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:05.250
of the hormonal aspects
of sexual behavior

00:35:05.250 --> 00:35:07.050
that are specific to females.

00:35:07.050 --> 00:35:10.590
Finally, back to
that lordosis reflex,

00:35:10.590 --> 00:35:13.110
you got to have a
spinal cord to pull off

00:35:13.110 --> 00:35:15.870
the full array of typical
mammalian female sexual

00:35:15.870 --> 00:35:16.700
behavior.

00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:19.500
So spinal pathways,
which do not exist

00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:23.560
in males, lordotic reflexes,
the back arching reflex,

00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:26.930
is exclusively a female one.

00:35:26.930 --> 00:35:29.340
Meanwhile, over on the
other side of things,

00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:31.460
there are regions
in the brain that

00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:34.880
tend to be more specialized
for sexual behavior in males

00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:38.370
than in females-- a different
part of the hypothalamus

00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:41.270
called the medial preoptic area.

00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:43.740
And the exact same
sort of evidence

00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:45.510
is for the ventral
medial hypothalamus

00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:49.320
in females-- lesion studies,
stimulation, recording studies,

00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:51.330
all that sort of
thing, and-- you

00:35:51.330 --> 00:35:53.320
guessed it-- whopping
great amounts

00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:56.970
of testosterone receptors,
androgen receptors,

00:35:56.970 --> 00:36:00.020
within the medial preoptic area.

00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:04.140
Very interestingly, something we
will hear more about next week

00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:06.780
or so, is another
region of the brain

00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:09.420
is involved in male
sexual behavior, which

00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:11.770
is the amygdala.

00:36:11.770 --> 00:36:12.560
Mhm.

00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:13.890
That's kind of interesting.

00:36:13.890 --> 00:36:14.620
The amygdala.

00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:17.295
We've already heard about
amygdala fear, anxiety,

00:36:17.295 --> 00:36:18.440
and all of that.

00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:23.430
But the amygdala also plays a
very major role in aggression.

00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:26.390
And there's a little
bit, a small domain,

00:36:26.390 --> 00:36:28.570
of amygdaloid function
in males that's

00:36:28.570 --> 00:36:33.560
involved in sexual behavior,
involved in sexual motivation.

00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:37.640
Medial preoptic area is much
more about sexual performance

00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:38.680
in males.

00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:42.350
Amygdala is much more
about sexual motivation.

00:36:42.350 --> 00:36:45.500
And all sorts of people have
speculated fairly reasonably,

00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:47.390
I think, that this
may have something

00:36:47.390 --> 00:36:50.340
to do with the fact explaining
why, among humans, it

00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:53.250
is far more likely to
be males than females

00:36:53.250 --> 00:36:56.690
who go about confusing
sexuality with aggression.

00:36:56.690 --> 00:36:59.470
That it's got something
to do with this weird role

00:36:59.470 --> 00:37:02.140
of the amygdala in
male sexual motivation,

00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:04.220
male sexual arousal.

00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:05.600
What else?

00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:06.410
OK.

00:37:06.410 --> 00:37:08.810
Males have penises, thus
they're the only ones

00:37:08.810 --> 00:37:11.420
who can have penile
erections, and to do

00:37:11.420 --> 00:37:14.020
that, autonomic nervous system.

00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:16.120
And what we will hear
about, what you already

00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:18.480
heard about in the introduction
to the autonomic nervous

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:21.010
system, but also in
the zebra's book is

00:37:21.010 --> 00:37:24.510
that whole business in order to
manage that, to pull that off

00:37:24.510 --> 00:37:27.400
initially, it is
parasympathetic nervous system

00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:29.180
that establishes the erection.

00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:32.930
The process of arousal involves
the transition to sympathetic.

00:37:32.930 --> 00:37:34.960
Full blast sympathetic
nervous system

00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:38.300
needed for ejaculation, that's
what all of that is about.

00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:40.340
Exclusive to males.

00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:43.370
But then it turns out it's
not exclusive to males

00:37:43.370 --> 00:37:46.960
because it's virtually the
exact same physiology underlying

00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:50.970
clitoral erections in females,
the same exact sort of thing,

00:37:50.970 --> 00:37:53.600
which, of course, brings up
the dangerous possibility

00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:56.240
of another spandrel in
our laps here in terms

00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:57.470
of making sense of that.

00:37:57.470 --> 00:37:58.640
I didn't say that just now.

00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:01.230
Did I say spandrels in your lap?

00:38:01.230 --> 00:38:02.370
OK.

00:38:02.370 --> 00:38:04.900
Bringing up that
possibility that is not

00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:07.650
specific to male physiology.

00:38:07.650 --> 00:38:10.240
What is specific,
of course, is stuff

00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:13.020
that's going on with penises
in terms of blood flow.

00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:16.310
There's generally a
dichotomy between species,

00:38:16.310 --> 00:38:19.910
between whether or not
males get vascular erections

00:38:19.910 --> 00:38:22.070
or muscular erections.

00:38:22.070 --> 00:38:25.880
Vascular erections, you increase
blood flow into the penis,

00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:28.190
and you stop it from
going out the other end.

00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:31.060
And thus, you get a
vascular-driven engorgement

00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:33.830
as DH Lawrence would no
doubt have described it.

00:38:33.830 --> 00:38:35.750
Alternatively, in
lots of species

00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:37.810
there are muscular erections.

00:38:37.810 --> 00:38:41.350
There is a muscle, for example,
found in rodent penises called

00:38:41.350 --> 00:38:44.549
the erector [? levae ?]
muscle-- well,

00:38:44.549 --> 00:38:46.590
that's not too surprising
that it's called that--

00:38:46.590 --> 00:38:50.030
and a whole bunch of
cell bodied neurons

00:38:50.030 --> 00:38:54.590
in the spinal cord responsible
for pulling up the sail

00:38:54.590 --> 00:38:56.270
or whatever it is you do there.

00:38:56.270 --> 00:38:59.290
And what you get are
differences in general.

00:38:59.290 --> 00:39:02.820
The muscular-driven
erections occur a lot faster.

00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:05.150
The vascular ones,
the hemodynamic ones,

00:39:05.150 --> 00:39:07.110
last a lot longer.

00:39:07.110 --> 00:39:09.160
Take your pick, but
it's essentially

00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:13.370
the exact same autonomic
physiology in both cases.

00:39:13.370 --> 00:39:16.170
Finally, one other
thing, a factoid,

00:39:16.170 --> 00:39:19.190
a useful one we heard last
week, which is insofar

00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:22.120
as there is very
similar physiology

00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:25.890
to orgasms in both sexes,
there is that difference

00:39:25.890 --> 00:39:28.810
in recovery time,
how long it takes

00:39:28.810 --> 00:39:30.800
for the sympathetic
nervous system

00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:33.500
to go back to
baseline post orgasm.

00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:36.000
And on the average,
a substantial sex

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:36.980
difference in that.

00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:39.810
Yes, everybody managed
to guess it last week,

00:39:39.810 --> 00:39:41.220
which direction it went.

00:39:41.220 --> 00:39:46.460
A far slower recovery time
in females than in males.

00:39:46.460 --> 00:39:48.580
In terms of underlying
neurobiology,

00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:51.850
something that was a
major finding in the field

00:39:51.850 --> 00:39:55.640
were brain regions that
differed in size depending

00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:58.710
on your gender,
including in humans.

00:39:58.710 --> 00:40:03.020
And this ushered in a whole
world of sexual dimorphism

00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:04.110
in the brain.

00:40:04.110 --> 00:40:07.420
And there have now been shown
to be all sorts of brain regions

00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:10.250
where, on the average,
you get differences

00:40:10.250 --> 00:40:12.350
in the size of nuclei.

00:40:12.350 --> 00:40:14.070
You get differences
in the number

00:40:14.070 --> 00:40:17.980
of axons going through a
bundle of fiber, all of that.

00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:20.509
And we will hear about some
more of those down the line.

00:40:20.509 --> 00:40:22.800
But the one that has gotten
the most attention in terms

00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:27.800
of sexual behavior is a
cluster of tiny nuclei

00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:31.564
in the hypothalamus
called the INAH cluster,

00:40:31.564 --> 00:40:36.810
the Interstitial Nucleus of
the Anterior Hypothalamus.

00:40:36.810 --> 00:40:38.690
Do not write down
what that stands for.

00:40:38.690 --> 00:40:40.950
But it's a little
nucleus in there

00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:44.260
there, a little subset
of neuronal cell bodies,

00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:47.460
where you get a very
substantial sex difference

00:40:47.460 --> 00:40:50.710
in the size of this area,
where on the average,

00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:54.780
it is about twice the
size in men as in women.

00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:57.690
And back to the
other week's rant

00:40:57.690 --> 00:41:00.620
about statistical
significance versus magnitude,

00:41:00.620 --> 00:41:02.110
this is a big effect.

00:41:02.110 --> 00:41:05.070
It is almost,
almost in the range

00:41:05.070 --> 00:41:07.890
where you can identify
the sex of somebody

00:41:07.890 --> 00:41:10.440
by looking at the size of
this nucleus in their brain

00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:11.390
post-mortem.

00:41:11.390 --> 00:41:13.680
In rodents, you pretty much can.

00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:17.140
A very reliable two-fold
difference, males

00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:18.630
larger than females.

00:41:18.630 --> 00:41:21.880
As we'll hear in a while,
one really interesting

00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:23.500
exception to that.

00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:24.150
OK.

00:41:24.150 --> 00:41:28.150
So either some areas of the
brain that are preferentially

00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:31.000
involved and activated
by sexual behavior,

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:34.320
depending on your gender,
or regions that differ in

00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:36.660
size substantially
by your gender.

00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:38.430
But then, at the end
of the day, there's

00:41:38.430 --> 00:41:40.930
all sorts of things that
are absolutely in common.

00:41:40.930 --> 00:41:45.250
Again, the physiology of
orgasm, exactly the same.

00:41:45.250 --> 00:41:48.810
What clinically the
picture is is males having

00:41:48.810 --> 00:41:50.460
problems with the whole system.

00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:54.110
The problem tends to be
too rapid of a transition

00:41:54.110 --> 00:41:56.550
from parasympathetic
to sympathetic.

00:41:56.550 --> 00:41:59.540
In other words, the world
of premature ejaculation.

00:41:59.540 --> 00:42:02.050
The more typical
medical problem in women

00:42:02.050 --> 00:42:05.390
is failure of the
transition from

00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:09.120
parasympathetic to sympathetic,
inability to reach orgasm.

00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:13.540
And it is, of course, a huge
social, cultural, political,

00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:15.860
philosophical
argument whether that

00:42:15.860 --> 00:42:19.860
counts as a pathology or
normal human variability.

00:42:19.860 --> 00:42:21.840
I'm not going anywhere
near that one.

00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:25.440
But nonetheless, that is
the more common pattern.

00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:28.460
Neurobiology that's
absolutely in common

00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:31.510
between the sexes, which
is all of that stuff

00:42:31.510 --> 00:42:34.870
at the very beginning of why
are they in such a rush at end,

00:42:34.870 --> 00:42:40.360
the neurobiology of pleasure,
and the neurobiology of reward,

00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:42.200
and of anticipation.

00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:44.690
And this is this
whole world of-- as we

00:42:44.690 --> 00:42:46.800
know already-- dopamine.

00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:49.520
The role of dopamine
in sexual behavior

00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:52.130
is virtually identical
in both sexes, which

00:42:52.130 --> 00:42:55.510
is to say it plays a huge role.

00:42:55.510 --> 00:42:58.760
You find circumstances
where you deplete dopamine

00:42:58.760 --> 00:43:00.320
from the relevant
brain regions--

00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:02.980
back to last Friday--
limbic system.

00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:05.760
You remember that
ventral tegmental area,

00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:08.170
which sends that big
dopaminergic projection

00:43:08.170 --> 00:43:11.500
to the nucleus accumbens,
which then passes it

00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:14.180
on to all sorts of
places in the brain.

00:43:14.180 --> 00:43:17.240
Deplete that
pathway of dopamine,

00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:20.230
and you're not going to
get a whole lot of interest

00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:21.750
in sexual behavior.

00:43:21.750 --> 00:43:26.040
You're not going to get a whole
lot of libido proceptivity.

00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:28.680
What's the classic
circumstance where

00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:30.880
you see depletion
of dopamine there

00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:34.000
and loss of proceptive libido?

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:35.590
Clinical depression.

00:43:35.590 --> 00:43:38.270
That's one of the defining
symptoms of depression

00:43:38.270 --> 00:43:41.290
amid the various numerous
forms of pleasure

00:43:41.290 --> 00:43:42.820
that go down the tubes.

00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:46.990
Loss of sexual interest, one
of the defining symptoms.

00:43:46.990 --> 00:43:48.570
So the dopamine system.

00:43:48.570 --> 00:43:50.760
The general term
given for that is

00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:55.030
the mesolimbic dopamine
system to distinguish it

00:43:55.030 --> 00:43:57.890
from some of the other ways that
dopamine is used in the brain.

00:43:57.890 --> 00:44:00.490
The mesolimbic
dopamine system is

00:44:00.490 --> 00:44:04.350
absolutely central to
the reinforcing aspects

00:44:04.350 --> 00:44:06.340
of sexual behavior.

00:44:06.340 --> 00:44:07.940
So what's the evidence for that?

00:44:07.940 --> 00:44:10.100
First off, back to
that distinction

00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:12.810
that I think I brought up
last week-- I wasn't paying

00:44:12.810 --> 00:44:14.920
attention-- but I
think I talked about,

00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:17.330
which is the dopamine
system there is not

00:44:17.330 --> 00:44:21.340
so much about reward, it's about
the anticipation of reward.

00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:23.410
Did I talk about that in
monkeys pressing levers?

00:44:23.410 --> 00:44:23.910
Yes.

00:44:23.910 --> 00:44:24.460
OK.

00:44:24.460 --> 00:44:27.716
I should probably read the
extended notes at some point

00:44:27.716 --> 00:44:29.740
or look at the film of this.

00:44:29.740 --> 00:44:30.320
OK.

00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:32.380
What you see there
is the dopamine

00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:34.620
is about the anticipation of.

00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:37.940
And the dopamine,
as we heard, is

00:44:37.940 --> 00:44:43.750
about also fueling the behaviors
needed to achieve the reward.

00:44:43.750 --> 00:44:46.760
Dopamine in this
mesolimbic pathway

00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:49.760
as driving
goal-directed behavior.

00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:52.340
And that is certainly the
case with sexual behavior.

00:44:52.340 --> 00:44:56.600
By now, there is a whole
literature involving humans

00:44:56.600 --> 00:44:58.660
where you stick them
in brain scanners

00:44:58.660 --> 00:45:01.490
and you do something
or other sexually

00:45:01.490 --> 00:45:04.750
arousing or interesting or
something or other to them.

00:45:04.750 --> 00:45:07.950
And then you see what parts
of the brain activate.

00:45:07.950 --> 00:45:12.250
And it's these dopamine pathways
consistently way up there.

00:45:12.250 --> 00:45:15.950
Showing just how subtle
this can be, how's this?

00:45:15.950 --> 00:45:19.720
You take men-- there's been a
whole literature by now showing

00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:23.410
that you present people in
brain scanners with pornography.

00:45:23.410 --> 00:45:26.360
And that must have been a really
interesting in human subjects

00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:27.950
release form you worked out.

00:45:27.950 --> 00:45:30.660
But showing in both sexes,
what you tend to see

00:45:30.660 --> 00:45:33.760
is activation of
dopaminergic regions.

00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:36.090
We will hear in a little
while a sex difference

00:45:36.090 --> 00:45:39.090
in that domain that will
probably not surprise anyone.

00:45:39.090 --> 00:45:41.220
But how's this for subtle?

00:45:41.220 --> 00:45:44.510
You take a guy, and you
show him the picture

00:45:44.510 --> 00:45:48.100
of someone of the opposite
sex if he is heterosexual.

00:45:48.100 --> 00:45:50.100
And you show him the
picture of this individual.

00:45:50.100 --> 00:45:54.140
And if it is someone who he
assesses as being attractive,

00:45:54.140 --> 00:45:57.160
you don't necessarily get
this dopaminergic pathway

00:45:57.160 --> 00:45:58.250
to activate.

00:45:58.250 --> 00:45:59.440
It depends.

00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:03.240
What this study showed was
if the person is making what

00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:06.870
would pass for eye contact, if
they were looking straight out,

00:46:06.870 --> 00:46:08.800
the dopamine system activates.

00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:12.150
And if they're looking
elsewhere, it doesn't activate.

00:46:12.150 --> 00:46:15.370
How's that for a classic
male sort of responsiveness?

00:46:15.370 --> 00:46:17.650
If it looks as if this
attractive person is

00:46:17.650 --> 00:46:19.490
looking at you, it activates.

00:46:19.490 --> 00:46:21.910
Even more distressingly
from this study,

00:46:21.910 --> 00:46:24.260
when you show men--
on the average,

00:46:24.260 --> 00:46:26.230
blah, blah--
pictures of women who

00:46:26.230 --> 00:46:29.350
they would rate as
being unattractive,

00:46:29.350 --> 00:46:31.950
it's when they're looking
away that the dopamine system

00:46:31.950 --> 00:46:33.360
activates.

00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:35.040
Oh my god!

00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:37.090
What is going on here?

00:46:37.090 --> 00:46:39.300
This is pitiful.

00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:43.050
What also has been shown is
the exact same eye contact

00:46:43.050 --> 00:46:47.530
phenomenon of gay men looking
at pictures of attractive men.

00:46:47.530 --> 00:46:50.340
Another theme we're going
to see over and over, which

00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:53.430
is sexual orientation
being pretty much

00:46:53.430 --> 00:46:55.680
trivial in terms of
how it influences

00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:57.300
some of this neurobiology.

00:46:57.300 --> 00:46:59.600
Just switch the gender
of the other individual,

00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:02.100
and it works exactly the same.

00:47:02.100 --> 00:47:05.780
Now when you look at this
business about dopamine rising

00:47:05.780 --> 00:47:09.430
in anticipation of a reward
rather than a response

00:47:09.430 --> 00:47:12.860
to the reward itself, it
brings up one of the-- it

00:47:12.860 --> 00:47:14.720
doesn't bring that
up-- it brings up

00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:17.000
one of the all-time
interesting studies

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.080
that was published
about a decade ago.

00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:19.580
OK.

00:47:19.580 --> 00:47:21.730
So the paradigm I
described last week,

00:47:21.730 --> 00:47:24.640
you put on the light, which
tells the monkey that,

00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:26.950
OK, we're starting
one of those sessions

00:47:26.950 --> 00:47:29.090
where if you press
the levers adequately,

00:47:29.090 --> 00:47:30.380
you will get a reward.

00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:33.120
And they now carry
out this behavior.

00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:35.050
And as a result, they
get the reward here.

00:47:35.050 --> 00:47:38.230
And as we saw, dopamine
doesn't go up after the reward.

00:47:38.230 --> 00:47:40.450
It goes up at this point.

00:47:40.450 --> 00:47:43.240
This is the I how to do this.

00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:44.420
This is going to be great.

00:47:44.420 --> 00:47:45.300
This is terrific.

00:47:45.300 --> 00:47:47.400
Here's where you get
the rise in dopamine.

00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:50.040
This is not only
the anticipation,

00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:52.350
but if you don't
have this rise, you

00:47:52.350 --> 00:47:55.340
don't get the behavior,
the goal-directed behavior.

00:47:55.340 --> 00:47:58.490
Now in this brilliant
study, what they did

00:47:58.490 --> 00:48:00.810
was transition from
a paradigm where,

00:48:00.810 --> 00:48:04.710
OK, the monkey presses the lever
10 times and gets the reward.

00:48:04.710 --> 00:48:07.490
Now what you do is
the monkey works,

00:48:07.490 --> 00:48:11.170
and it gets the reward
only half the time.

00:48:11.170 --> 00:48:16.390
It gets only a 50% reward
rate unpredictably.

00:48:16.390 --> 00:48:18.690
And what happens to dopamine?

00:48:18.690 --> 00:48:19.700
OK.

00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:20.550
Got your choice.

00:48:20.550 --> 00:48:21.600
What's your vote?

00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:24.820
It doesn't rise as much.

00:48:24.820 --> 00:48:28.520
It rises the exact same amount.

00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:30.780
It rises even higher.

00:48:30.780 --> 00:48:31.390
OK.

00:48:31.390 --> 00:48:34.630
You guys all understand
anticipation and goal--

00:48:34.630 --> 00:48:35.900
it does this.

00:48:35.900 --> 00:48:37.610
It's one of the
biggest rises you

00:48:37.610 --> 00:48:40.640
will find in dopamine in
the brain short of cocaine.

00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:43.910
What have you just
introduced into there?

00:48:43.910 --> 00:48:45.830
This is, I'm all over it.

00:48:45.830 --> 00:48:46.970
I know how this works.

00:48:46.970 --> 00:48:48.130
This is going to be great.

00:48:48.130 --> 00:48:49.840
I have mastery and control.

00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:52.220
I am the captain of
my own lever pressing.

00:48:52.220 --> 00:48:53.690
This is all about that.

00:48:53.690 --> 00:48:55.460
What's this about?

00:48:55.460 --> 00:48:57.230
This is what dopamine
does when you've

00:48:57.230 --> 00:49:00.550
introduced the word
maybe into the equation.

00:49:00.550 --> 00:49:04.510
And that is incredibly
reinforcing.

00:49:04.510 --> 00:49:09.020
And people will work like
mad in contexts of maybe

00:49:09.020 --> 00:49:12.770
far more so than when they
work in contexts of certainty.

00:49:12.770 --> 00:49:14.990
Psychologists have
known this forever.

00:49:14.990 --> 00:49:17.730
This is intermittent
reinforcement.

00:49:17.730 --> 00:49:20.730
You never get more
behavior out of an organism

00:49:20.730 --> 00:49:23.940
than when you have
introduced a maybe into it.

00:49:23.940 --> 00:49:26.020
And part of the
brilliance of this study

00:49:26.020 --> 00:49:27.750
was what they then did.

00:49:27.750 --> 00:49:31.920
Now animals either got
reward 25% of the time

00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:34.860
or 75% of the time.

00:49:34.860 --> 00:49:37.170
On a certain level,
these are diametrically

00:49:37.170 --> 00:49:38.690
opposite manipulations.

00:49:38.690 --> 00:49:40.244
In one, you're
getting more rewards.

00:49:40.244 --> 00:49:41.660
In the other,
you're getting less.

00:49:41.660 --> 00:49:43.910
What's the thing
they have in common?

00:49:43.910 --> 00:49:48.210
They both had smaller
maybes than the 50% version.

00:49:48.210 --> 00:49:51.670
And what you see is it
would look like this.

00:49:51.670 --> 00:49:57.680
100%, 25% or 75%, 50%
maximizing the maybe.

00:49:57.680 --> 00:49:59.850
And one of the most
brilliant things

00:49:59.850 --> 00:50:02.820
that various social
engineers do with humans

00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:06.770
is convince people that there's
a 50% maybe when it is not

00:50:06.770 --> 00:50:08.490
50% in the slightest.

00:50:08.490 --> 00:50:10.890
That's what Las Vegas is about.

00:50:10.890 --> 00:50:14.670
That's an entire world of very
smart psychologists making

00:50:14.670 --> 00:50:17.170
people think in
circumstances where there's

00:50:17.170 --> 00:50:21.450
like one tenth of 1% of a maybe
going on there that is actually

00:50:21.450 --> 00:50:22.700
a 50%.

00:50:22.700 --> 00:50:25.950
And when you do that, you
get dopamine like crazy,

00:50:25.950 --> 00:50:28.550
and you get
goal-directed behavior

00:50:28.550 --> 00:50:32.080
as a result. Really,
really powerful.

00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:35.910
And this is so strongly the case
that this explains an extremely

00:50:35.910 --> 00:50:38.750
cynical thing that a
guy I knew in my dorm

00:50:38.750 --> 00:50:40.610
back when used to
say all the time.

00:50:40.610 --> 00:50:42.990
How's this for like a
dispirited view of what

00:50:42.990 --> 00:50:47.250
life is like, but possibly
absolutely accurate, which is,

00:50:47.250 --> 00:50:51.102
a relationship is the price you
pay for the anticipation of it.

00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:55.280
How's that for a grim worldview?

00:50:55.280 --> 00:50:55.860
Go figure.

00:50:55.860 --> 00:50:59.590
This guy had-- what a string
of disastrous relationships.

00:50:59.590 --> 00:51:03.380
But what you see here
is introduce a maybe,

00:51:03.380 --> 00:51:05.910
and it is very, very powerful.

00:51:05.910 --> 00:51:09.910
One final piece of the dopamine
system here that is pertinent,

00:51:09.910 --> 00:51:12.170
which is, as you
might expect from all

00:51:12.170 --> 00:51:14.600
of our molecular
biology stuff, there's

00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:18.450
all sorts of different
dopamine receptor subtypes.

00:51:18.450 --> 00:51:21.910
And two of them are pertinent
to this world of sexual behavior

00:51:21.910 --> 00:51:25.900
and reward, what is called
the shockingly the D1 dopamine

00:51:25.900 --> 00:51:28.610
receptor and the D2
dopamine receptor.

00:51:28.610 --> 00:51:32.720
And what studies show is
in monogamous species, what

00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:36.700
happens is right after mating,
when a pair bond is first

00:51:36.700 --> 00:51:41.390
formed, the second that's over
with, levels of the D2 receptor

00:51:41.390 --> 00:51:42.530
go way down.

00:51:42.530 --> 00:51:46.080
You down regulate the
levels of the receptor,

00:51:46.080 --> 00:51:50.130
and you up regulate the
levels of the D1 receptor.

00:51:50.130 --> 00:51:51.740
What's that about?

00:51:51.740 --> 00:51:56.160
If you drive down the D2
levels before they even mate,

00:51:56.160 --> 00:51:59.230
they don't form a pair bond.

00:51:59.230 --> 00:52:03.050
If you prevent the decline in
the D2's after they've mated

00:52:03.050 --> 00:52:07.780
and pair bonded or if you
prevent the rise in the D1's,

00:52:07.780 --> 00:52:08.840
they'll pair bond.

00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:10.440
And then, 8 and
1/2 minutes later,

00:52:10.440 --> 00:52:12.950
they will go and pair
bond with somebody else.

00:52:12.950 --> 00:52:18.380
The D2's seem to mediate the
rewarding anticipatory aspects

00:52:18.380 --> 00:52:19.750
of pair bonding.

00:52:19.750 --> 00:52:22.610
The D1's, on a certain
rodential level,

00:52:22.610 --> 00:52:26.600
seem to mediate the pleasure
of the monogamous, the truly

00:52:26.600 --> 00:52:28.880
monogamous features
of the pair bond.

00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:32.160
So a very interesting
interaction between the two.

00:52:32.160 --> 00:52:32.660
OK.

00:52:32.660 --> 00:52:34.800
One last thing about
dopamine, and this one

00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:38.070
is like even more depressing
than relationships

00:52:38.070 --> 00:52:39.300
are the price you pay.

00:52:39.300 --> 00:52:42.980
This was a study which
was really like someday

00:52:42.980 --> 00:52:44.840
may come to haunt you majorly.

00:52:44.840 --> 00:52:46.610
And in this study,
what they did--

00:52:46.610 --> 00:52:49.430
it was another one of those
brain imaging study ones.

00:52:49.430 --> 00:52:51.880
And what they did was they
took people in two categories.

00:52:51.880 --> 00:52:53.940
In both cases,
these are people who

00:52:53.940 --> 00:52:58.050
had found their beloved,
their beloved, the person who

00:52:58.050 --> 00:53:00.990
was their soul mate,
the person in whose arms

00:53:00.990 --> 00:53:03.560
they were going to die
someday, the person.

00:53:03.560 --> 00:53:05.440
And they divided it
between these two groups.

00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:08.000
One was a group where they had
known the person in whose arms

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:10.520
they were going to die
for like 2 and 1/2 weeks.

00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:12.510
And the other is when
they had been together

00:53:12.510 --> 00:53:14.620
for more than five years.

00:53:14.620 --> 00:53:18.230
So you put somebody
in the brain scanner,

00:53:18.230 --> 00:53:21.480
and you start flashing up
at speed, subliminal speeds,

00:53:21.480 --> 00:53:23.843
of pictures of
individuals they know.

00:53:23.843 --> 00:53:25.750
Important control in the study.

00:53:25.750 --> 00:53:28.920
And embedded in there is a
picture of their beloved.

00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:30.620
And suddenly, somewhere
along the way,

00:53:30.620 --> 00:53:32.830
up flashes the picture
of their beloved.

00:53:32.830 --> 00:53:37.230
Be in a short-term relationship
and the dopamine system

00:53:37.230 --> 00:53:40.630
goes crazy and
activates like mad.

00:53:40.630 --> 00:53:43.100
Now, you come back
five years later

00:53:43.100 --> 00:53:45.440
into that same relationship
with the beloved,

00:53:45.440 --> 00:53:47.250
and you do the exact same thing.

00:53:47.250 --> 00:53:50.540
And you flash up their picture,
and the dopamine system

00:53:50.540 --> 00:53:51.750
doesn't activate.

00:53:51.750 --> 00:53:55.680
What activates instead was
that anterior cingulate thing

00:53:55.680 --> 00:53:59.610
we heard about on Friday
having to do with empathy,

00:53:59.610 --> 00:54:02.210
and comfort, and all of that.

00:54:02.210 --> 00:54:05.920
In other words, what we see here
is the neurochemical transition

00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:09.140
from one's beloved
from causing your blood

00:54:09.140 --> 00:54:12.420
to run scalding hot
to your beloved being

00:54:12.420 --> 00:54:14.580
like a comfortable old armchair.

00:54:14.580 --> 00:54:17.830
This is one depressing study.

00:54:17.830 --> 00:54:21.260
So let's take a five-minute
break to contemplate that one.

00:54:21.260 --> 00:54:21.760
OK.

00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:22.760
And then we will resume.

00:54:27.850 --> 00:54:31.450
Lots of good questions
just now during the break.

00:54:31.450 --> 00:54:33.750
Disappointingly few
along the lines of,

00:54:33.750 --> 00:54:35.680
I've got a friend who.

00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:37.370
So not a bunch of those.

00:54:37.370 --> 00:54:38.054
But let's see.

00:54:38.054 --> 00:54:38.970
A number of questions.

00:54:38.970 --> 00:54:42.370
First one, can I repeat what
I said about the D1 and the D2

00:54:42.370 --> 00:54:43.410
receptors?

00:54:43.410 --> 00:54:44.020
OK.

00:54:44.020 --> 00:54:47.230
These are different types
of receptors for dopamine.

00:54:47.230 --> 00:54:50.590
In other words, they all respond
to the same neurotransmitter

00:54:50.590 --> 00:54:53.420
dopamine, but in different ways.

00:54:53.420 --> 00:54:56.320
And these receptors are found
on different neuron types.

00:54:56.320 --> 00:54:58.810
So you're getting into all
sorts of different pathways.

00:54:58.810 --> 00:55:03.480
What you see is, in rodents,
in pair bonding rodents,

00:55:03.480 --> 00:55:05.570
they better have
elevated levels,

00:55:05.570 --> 00:55:09.160
they better have D2
receptors on neurons

00:55:09.160 --> 00:55:12.470
being fed by this mesolimbic
reward dopamine pathway.

00:55:12.470 --> 00:55:17.720
They have to have D2 receptors
to form the pair bond

00:55:17.720 --> 00:55:20.970
for the attachment to occur.

00:55:20.970 --> 00:55:25.770
The second that happens, you
need to have low levels of D2

00:55:25.770 --> 00:55:30.820
and high levels of D1 to remain
faithful in your pair bonded

00:55:30.820 --> 00:55:31.950
relationship.

00:55:31.950 --> 00:55:34.930
So what you see in these voles
is right after the pair bond

00:55:34.930 --> 00:55:39.020
occurs, there's down regulation
of the D2's and up regulation

00:55:39.020 --> 00:55:40.200
of the D1's.

00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:42.390
And if you prevent
that from happening,

00:55:42.390 --> 00:55:46.164
the pair bond that's been
formed does not prove lasting.

00:55:46.164 --> 00:55:47.580
So that's what I
was saying there.

00:55:47.580 --> 00:55:49.850
Somebody brought up
the great question,

00:55:49.850 --> 00:55:52.470
which I was going to say
something about and forgot,

00:55:52.470 --> 00:55:56.370
which is, well, how
about like the D2 D1

00:55:56.370 --> 00:56:00.410
ratios in humans and their
sexual behavior stuff?

00:56:00.410 --> 00:56:03.130
And there's been
one study showing

00:56:03.130 --> 00:56:06.230
that a higher ratio
of D2 to D1 predicts

00:56:06.230 --> 00:56:08.290
more stable relationships.

00:56:08.290 --> 00:56:09.550
Small effect.

00:56:09.550 --> 00:56:11.030
Not replicated yet.

00:56:11.030 --> 00:56:14.640
But nonetheless, that's
kind of interesting.

00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:17.860
So on a certain
level then, D2 seems

00:56:17.860 --> 00:56:20.070
to be required, at
least shown in rodents.

00:56:20.070 --> 00:56:21.170
Who knows about us?

00:56:21.170 --> 00:56:24.270
D2 is about the formation
of the attachment.

00:56:24.270 --> 00:56:28.410
D1 is about the maintenance
of it, the faithfulness of it,

00:56:28.410 --> 00:56:29.550
if you will.

00:56:29.550 --> 00:56:31.540
Next, somebody
bringing up the issue

00:56:31.540 --> 00:56:33.800
in terms of female orgasm.

00:56:33.800 --> 00:56:37.090
Maybe what female orgasm is
about is a mate selection

00:56:37.090 --> 00:56:42.310
mechanism, as in
individuals who increase

00:56:42.310 --> 00:56:44.500
your likelihood of
having orgasms are ones

00:56:44.500 --> 00:56:48.810
you are more likely to
lower your D2 receptors for.

00:56:48.810 --> 00:56:50.430
But the one problem
with that one

00:56:50.430 --> 00:56:52.650
that makes wonderful sense--
what the studies tend

00:56:52.650 --> 00:56:55.100
to show though is the
likelihood of orgasm

00:56:55.100 --> 00:56:58.360
is much more a function
of who the female is

00:56:58.360 --> 00:57:01.640
than who the male is that they
are with, arguing against that.

00:57:01.640 --> 00:57:02.350
Let's see.

00:57:02.350 --> 00:57:03.630
Finally-- no.

00:57:03.630 --> 00:57:04.130
Not that.

00:57:04.130 --> 00:57:04.290
OK.

00:57:04.290 --> 00:57:05.450
So we already covered that.

00:57:05.450 --> 00:57:07.720
And there was one
additional question.

00:57:07.720 --> 00:57:08.220
OK.

00:57:08.220 --> 00:57:10.550
So what's the driving
force in terms

00:57:10.550 --> 00:57:14.020
of the proximal reinforcing
pleasurable aspects

00:57:14.020 --> 00:57:15.330
of sexual behavior?

00:57:15.330 --> 00:57:17.490
What's up with why
only some species--

00:57:17.490 --> 00:57:20.680
us predominantly-- have
non-reproductive sex,

00:57:20.680 --> 00:57:23.220
can have sex all the
time, versus other species

00:57:23.220 --> 00:57:25.010
that only do for reproduction?

00:57:25.010 --> 00:57:27.640
What that means is
in other species,

00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:31.320
the endocrinology of
ovulation is the thing

00:57:31.320 --> 00:57:33.380
that makes sex pleasurable.

00:57:33.380 --> 00:57:35.440
And we will see shortly
what that's about.

00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:38.520
In females, it's the
hormones associated

00:57:38.520 --> 00:57:42.580
with ovulation that
sensitize various tactile

00:57:42.580 --> 00:57:48.470
receptors to respond in ways
that mediate proximal pleasure.

00:57:48.470 --> 00:57:51.720
And in males, it's
the female giving off,

00:57:51.720 --> 00:57:54.860
for example, the right
pheromones, the right releasing

00:57:54.860 --> 00:57:58.750
stimuli, driven by the
right hormone levels that

00:57:58.750 --> 00:58:03.020
constitute the proximal signal
of pleasurable anticipation.

00:58:03.020 --> 00:58:06.390
And what you find in humans
is it doesn't work that way.

00:58:06.390 --> 00:58:09.250
You do not need, for
example, in women

00:58:09.250 --> 00:58:13.360
the elevated levels of estrogen
typical of ovulation in order

00:58:13.360 --> 00:58:18.560
to have tactile responsiveness
to sexually arousing stimuli.

00:58:18.560 --> 00:58:19.890
Stay tuned though.

00:58:19.890 --> 00:58:23.290
It's easier though when
estrogen levels are higher.

00:58:23.290 --> 00:58:23.810
OK.

00:58:23.810 --> 00:58:26.520
Final brain region
relevant to all of this

00:58:26.520 --> 00:58:28.500
is the frontal cortex.

00:58:28.500 --> 00:58:32.230
We already got a first pass at
the frontal cortex last week.

00:58:32.230 --> 00:58:37.760
And frontal cortex regulating
your behavior, impulse control,

00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:40.360
all that sort of thing,
gratification postponement--

00:58:40.360 --> 00:58:43.260
this plays a large role
in sexual behavior.

00:58:43.260 --> 00:58:46.000
What's the easy
immediate explanation

00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:49.290
that one can come up with,
what the frontal cortex does

00:58:49.290 --> 00:58:54.050
is it makes you be appropriate
in your sexual behavior.

00:58:54.050 --> 00:58:56.490
It teaches you the
appropriate context.

00:58:56.490 --> 00:59:00.730
It teaches you what aspects
of proceptive sexual behavior

00:59:00.730 --> 00:59:02.920
is not a good idea.

00:59:02.920 --> 00:59:06.050
It keeps you from doing
things you would regret vastly

00:59:06.050 --> 00:59:06.920
afterward.

00:59:06.920 --> 00:59:08.980
That's a very easy
version of it.

00:59:08.980 --> 00:59:11.240
And commensurate
with that, you see

00:59:11.240 --> 00:59:13.540
lots of circumstances
of individuals

00:59:13.540 --> 00:59:17.190
with frontal cortical damage
doing highly inappropriate

00:59:17.190 --> 00:59:18.640
sexual behavior.

00:59:18.640 --> 00:59:22.030
One example of it, and one
of those horrifying things

00:59:22.030 --> 00:59:23.640
that can happen--
this was a case

00:59:23.640 --> 00:59:26.780
that actually happened in
a nursing home in Martinez

00:59:26.780 --> 00:59:28.830
in the East Bay a
number of years ago.

00:59:28.830 --> 00:59:32.490
This was a man in his 80s
who had had stroke damage

00:59:32.490 --> 00:59:34.710
to his frontal
cortex, who was found

00:59:34.710 --> 00:59:38.090
to have raped a woman
there, another 80-year-old

00:59:38.090 --> 00:59:39.930
with Alzheimer's disease.

00:59:39.930 --> 00:59:42.230
Damage the frontal
cortex, and all sorts

00:59:42.230 --> 00:59:45.790
of the, "this is not sexual
behavior that you do"

00:59:45.790 --> 00:59:48.260
constraints go down the tubes.

00:59:48.260 --> 00:59:51.380
Just as importantly though,
what the frontal cortex,

00:59:51.380 --> 00:59:53.620
with all of it's giving
you the discipline

00:59:53.620 --> 00:59:55.590
to do the right thing,
some of the time,

00:59:55.590 --> 00:59:57.630
what that takes the
form of is getting

00:59:57.630 --> 01:00:00.460
you to do proceptive
sexual behavior.

01:00:00.460 --> 01:00:03.080
For example, you
are trying to do

01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:06.730
some courtship of some
other antlered ungulate

01:00:06.730 --> 01:00:07.920
that you are courting.

01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:11.130
And this is terrifying because
there is another individual

01:00:11.130 --> 01:00:12.320
challenging you.

01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:13.960
And there's the
frontal cortex that

01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:17.480
is getting you to carry
out those sexual behaviors

01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:20.530
to that point, even if it is
a terrifying circumstance.

01:00:20.530 --> 01:00:23.750
Nonetheless, what the frontal
cortex mostly is about

01:00:23.750 --> 01:00:26.510
is reigning in sexual behavior.

01:00:26.510 --> 01:00:31.230
It's not changing the fixed
action patterns of sex.

01:00:31.230 --> 01:00:33.760
It's changing the context
in which the fixed action

01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:35.940
patterns occur.

01:00:35.940 --> 01:00:38.170
So now, we are ready
to look at one more

01:00:38.170 --> 01:00:40.260
feature of the
neurobiology, which

01:00:40.260 --> 01:00:44.370
is when somebody is having sex,
what hormonal responses are

01:00:44.370 --> 01:00:45.360
triggered?

01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:47.840
Notice this is not here.

01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:51.130
This is not what hormones
have to do with bringing

01:00:51.130 --> 01:00:52.700
about sexual behavior.

01:00:52.700 --> 01:00:57.910
This is, what are the hormonal
responses to sexual behavior?

01:00:57.910 --> 01:01:02.470
Starting off in females,
including human females,

01:01:02.470 --> 01:01:05.530
having sex increases
secretion of

01:01:05.530 --> 01:01:07.850
progesterone-derived hormones.

01:01:07.850 --> 01:01:12.960
And that has something to do
with reinforcing the pleasure.

01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:16.750
Interestingly, in females
the world over, having sex

01:01:16.750 --> 01:01:20.470
increases the level of
testosterone-related hormones

01:01:20.470 --> 01:01:22.550
in the bloodstream, androgens.

01:01:22.550 --> 01:01:26.760
Women, females, generate
androgens maybe 5%

01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:28.430
the levels you see in males.

01:01:28.430 --> 01:01:30.830
And they come out of
the adrenal glands.

01:01:30.830 --> 01:01:34.230
And they seem to play
a very central role

01:01:34.230 --> 01:01:39.120
in mediating sexual motivation,
sexual arousal, in females.

01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:40.340
How is that's shown?

01:01:40.340 --> 01:01:43.270
Obvious experimental
studies with lab rats.

01:01:43.270 --> 01:01:45.030
How is that's shown in humans?

01:01:45.030 --> 01:01:49.480
When women have any of a number
of types of diseases where you

01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:51.650
have to take out
the adrenal glands,

01:01:51.650 --> 01:01:55.140
sexual motivation, sexual
arousal, goes down.

01:01:55.140 --> 01:01:58.090
Give them replacement
androgens, and

01:01:58.090 --> 01:02:01.900
sexual arousal, sexual
proceptivity, returns, so

01:02:01.900 --> 01:02:04.490
androgens there playing a role.

01:02:04.490 --> 01:02:06.730
But probably most
importantly, in terms

01:02:06.730 --> 01:02:10.220
of hormones triggered by
sexual behavior in females,

01:02:10.220 --> 01:02:13.230
is the release of oxytocin.

01:02:13.230 --> 01:02:15.940
Oxytocin is really interesting.

01:02:15.940 --> 01:02:17.840
We've heard about
oxytocin twice already.

01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:21.640
One, is when it's coming out
of the posterior pituitary.

01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:24.660
And the second is that minor
business the other day,

01:02:24.660 --> 01:02:26.790
last Wednesday,
of oxytocin being

01:02:26.790 --> 01:02:29.570
another one of those
hypothalamic hormones that

01:02:29.570 --> 01:02:32.430
helps to release ACTH
from the pituitary.

01:02:32.430 --> 01:02:34.300
Remember, it doesn't
directly release.

01:02:34.300 --> 01:02:37.950
It's a modulator, a CRH action,
if-then clause, et cetera.

01:02:37.950 --> 01:02:40.950
But those are the two ways
we've heard about oxytocin.

01:02:40.950 --> 01:02:45.690
Oxytocin also works in the
brain as a neurotransmitter

01:02:45.690 --> 01:02:47.550
and neuromodulator.

01:02:47.550 --> 01:02:49.140
And what does it do there?

01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:52.080
It appears to play
a very central role

01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:55.680
in forming attachments,
a very central role

01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:57.780
in forming of pair bonds.

01:02:57.780 --> 01:03:01.040
And it, along with dopamine
and the D2 receptors,

01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:05.110
are critical for female
voles of monogamous species

01:03:05.110 --> 01:03:06.610
to form pair bonds.

01:03:06.610 --> 01:03:11.400
Female humans, when having
sex, secrete lots of oxytocin

01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:14.250
and activate oxytocin
pathways in the brain.

01:03:14.250 --> 01:03:19.040
And it appears to play a role
in the formation of attachment.

01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:22.950
Interestingly-- how's this--
a whole body of research

01:03:22.950 --> 01:03:26.750
now showing that if
you introduce oxytocin

01:03:26.750 --> 01:03:29.770
into the brains of
humans experimentally,

01:03:29.770 --> 01:03:32.900
they become more trusting.

01:03:32.900 --> 01:03:37.800
Amazing body of research where
you take aerosolized oxytocin

01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:40.180
and you spritz it
up people's noses.

01:03:40.180 --> 01:03:41.760
And what they showed
in the studies

01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:44.410
were, number one,
one type of study.

01:03:44.410 --> 01:03:48.360
You then play a clip of
somebody making an argument

01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:51.170
for some stance in
some debate, and people

01:03:51.170 --> 01:03:52.700
believe the person more.

01:03:52.700 --> 01:03:54.900
They find their argument
more convincing.

01:03:54.900 --> 01:03:56.770
They trust the person more.

01:03:56.770 --> 01:03:58.690
Or the other version
that's been shown

01:03:58.690 --> 01:04:01.800
is you spritz oxytocin
up the noses of people,

01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:04.820
and you make them more
cooperative in their game

01:04:04.820 --> 01:04:07.290
theory play, the
ways in which they

01:04:07.290 --> 01:04:10.450
go about playing prisoner's
dilemma and other games

01:04:10.450 --> 01:04:12.780
we will hear about
later on as well.

01:04:12.780 --> 01:04:16.770
This has given rise to a whole
new field-- I kid you not--

01:04:16.770 --> 01:04:19.450
called neuromarketing.

01:04:19.450 --> 01:04:22.880
The notion that if only you
could spritz oxytocin up

01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:26.730
the noses of people right before
your television ad comes on,

01:04:26.730 --> 01:04:29.150
they're going to believe
you when you say it

01:04:29.150 --> 01:04:31.800
will make you happy
to buy our thing.

01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:33.370
And they will fall for it.

01:04:33.370 --> 01:04:35.820
There are actually
neuroendocrinologists

01:04:35.820 --> 01:04:40.050
making a living now selling
their wares to neuromarketing

01:04:40.050 --> 01:04:42.950
people-- self-proclaimed ones.

01:04:42.950 --> 01:04:45.030
No doubt they are
spritzing oxytocin up

01:04:45.030 --> 01:04:48.270
the noses of those
capitalists to get

01:04:48.270 --> 01:04:49.840
them to hire them to do this.

01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:53.660
But oxytocin playing
a role in this.

01:04:53.660 --> 01:04:55.850
So that's kind of interesting.

01:04:55.850 --> 01:04:58.970
Because what's oxytocin
mostly doing in the body?

01:04:58.970 --> 01:05:01.820
The vast majority
of oxytocin is not

01:05:01.820 --> 01:05:04.130
this stuff up in the
brain in these pathways,

01:05:04.130 --> 01:05:07.690
some of them impinging on
dopamine-releasing neurons.

01:05:07.690 --> 01:05:11.000
The vast majority is not
the oxytocin sitting there

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.960
in the hypothalamus doing
something or other to ACTH

01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:15.100
in the pituitary.

01:05:15.100 --> 01:05:18.280
The vast majority is this stuff
coming out of the posterior

01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:19.460
pituitary.

01:05:19.460 --> 01:05:22.670
And what does oxytocin
have to do there?

01:05:22.670 --> 01:05:25.060
It has to do with milk letdown.

01:05:25.060 --> 01:05:27.120
It has to do with nursing.

01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:30.200
And suddenly, instead,
it's playing a role

01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:32.640
in forming sexual pair bonding.

01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:35.800
And the argument is
made that attachment,

01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:40.470
monogamous attachment, sexual
attachment, is in some way,

01:05:40.470 --> 01:05:44.020
evolutionarily a descendent
of the neurobiology

01:05:44.020 --> 01:05:46.660
of mother-offspring attachment.

01:05:46.660 --> 01:05:49.990
That that's where it is
originally being driven by.

01:05:49.990 --> 01:05:53.620
So oxytocin playing
a role there as well.

01:05:53.620 --> 01:05:56.580
Meanwhile, over at the
male end of things,

01:05:56.580 --> 01:05:58.990
up go testosterone
levels during sex.

01:05:58.990 --> 01:06:02.560
In a surprisingly linear
way, the more sexual behavior

01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:04.640
in a male, the higher
testosterone levels

01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:06.100
are found afterward.

01:06:06.100 --> 01:06:09.280
Critically, critically--
stay tuned for a little

01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:13.890
while-- these are elevations
of testosterone in response

01:06:13.890 --> 01:06:15.510
to sexual behavior.

01:06:15.510 --> 01:06:19.570
As we'll see, the evidence
that high testosterone levels

01:06:19.570 --> 01:06:24.500
make males more sexually active
is basically nonexistent.

01:06:24.500 --> 01:06:27.250
So critical, critical
proviso here.

01:06:27.250 --> 01:06:31.430
This is sex increasing
testosterone secretion, not

01:06:31.430 --> 01:06:33.440
the other way around.

01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:34.610
What else?

01:06:34.610 --> 01:06:37.590
Meanwhile, back to the
posterior pituitary.

01:06:37.590 --> 01:06:39.080
Was that a question?

01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:39.580
No.

01:06:39.580 --> 01:06:39.920
OK.

01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:41.030
That was a head scratch.

01:06:41.030 --> 01:06:41.590
OK.

01:06:41.590 --> 01:06:43.360
Back to the posterior pituitary.

01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:46.870
The other hormone coming
out from there, vasopressin.

01:06:46.870 --> 01:06:51.420
And oxytocin is to females
as vasopressin is to males.

01:06:51.420 --> 01:06:52.830
And we've already
heard something

01:06:52.830 --> 01:06:55.440
about this back in
the molecular genetics

01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:59.310
stuff in those if-then clauses
and unlikely ways in which you

01:06:59.310 --> 01:07:00.570
get mutations.

01:07:00.570 --> 01:07:04.620
vasopressin, vasopressin
also is found

01:07:04.620 --> 01:07:09.260
in the nervous system, where it
serves as neuromodulatory role.

01:07:09.260 --> 01:07:14.130
And vasopressin is critical
for forming a pair bond.

01:07:14.130 --> 01:07:16.220
Back to that business
about when you

01:07:16.220 --> 01:07:20.190
look at monogamous versus
polygamist species,

01:07:20.190 --> 01:07:21.510
what's going on?

01:07:21.510 --> 01:07:23.910
What you have uniquely
in the monogamous

01:07:23.910 --> 01:07:27.830
species is expression of
the vasopressin receptor

01:07:27.830 --> 01:07:32.731
gene on neurons that
released dopamine.

01:07:32.731 --> 01:07:36.810
In other words, male
secrete vasopressin.

01:07:36.810 --> 01:07:41.320
And if you are of a species
where vasopressin now goes

01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:45.540
and stimulates dopamine
neurons, you decide you really,

01:07:45.540 --> 01:07:48.720
really, really liked having
sex with this other vole.

01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:50.720
And you come back for more.

01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:54.520
And that's the driving force on
the formation of the pair bond.

01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:57.480
Incredible studies
showing that if you

01:07:57.480 --> 01:08:00.630
take male voles from
the polygamist species

01:08:00.630 --> 01:08:03.070
and, due to gene
transfer techniques--

01:08:03.070 --> 01:08:04.720
I've mentioned the
study already--

01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:08.220
but you now stick
vasopressin receptors

01:08:08.220 --> 01:08:12.050
into those dopamine neurons,
those polygamist males

01:08:12.050 --> 01:08:14.520
now become pair bonding males.

01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:16.810
They now become monogamous.

01:08:16.810 --> 01:08:19.319
So really interesting.

01:08:19.319 --> 01:08:21.960
What you then see
in these studies is

01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:24.960
you look at these monogamous
species where the males have

01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:27.750
vasopressin receptors on
these dopamine neurons,

01:08:27.750 --> 01:08:29.899
and you look at
individual males,

01:08:29.899 --> 01:08:32.290
and the ones who
have more receptors

01:08:32.290 --> 01:08:35.920
there are forming
pair bonds faster.

01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:38.620
It takes fewer rounds
of mating with a female

01:08:38.620 --> 01:08:41.229
to form a pair bond.

01:08:41.229 --> 01:08:43.510
So what about primates?

01:08:43.510 --> 01:08:46.960
So you start off looking at two
different primate species, one

01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:50.939
pair bonding, marmoset monkeys,
New World marmoset monkeys,

01:08:50.939 --> 01:08:53.479
and then one classic
tournament species,

01:08:53.479 --> 01:08:57.250
polygamous primate
species, rhesus monkeys.

01:08:57.250 --> 01:09:00.729
And what you see is
you've got the variant,

01:09:00.729 --> 01:09:04.830
the monogamous vole,
vasopressin receptor gene

01:09:04.830 --> 01:09:07.600
variant in the pair
bonding monkey species,

01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:08.830
in the marmosets.

01:09:08.830 --> 01:09:10.850
And you get the
polygamous version

01:09:10.850 --> 01:09:16.670
of the gene in the
rhesus monkeys.

01:09:16.670 --> 01:09:18.689
So it maps on there as well.

01:09:18.689 --> 01:09:22.240
So the more of this receptor
in these dopamine pathways

01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:25.140
within monogamous
species, the more rapidly

01:09:25.140 --> 01:09:26.810
they form a pair bond.

01:09:26.810 --> 01:09:30.960
And what you see is differences
in the mere presence of them

01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:34.990
in comparing pair bonding
versus non-pair bonding rodents

01:09:34.990 --> 01:09:37.600
and monkeys.

01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:40.020
So how about humans?

01:09:40.020 --> 01:09:43.189
First thing that comes
up is, among the apes,

01:09:43.189 --> 01:09:47.620
you also find the two
variants, the monogamous vole

01:09:47.620 --> 01:09:50.590
variant of the
vasopressin receptor gene

01:09:50.590 --> 01:09:53.450
and the polygamous male variant.

01:09:53.450 --> 01:09:55.380
So what species
do you see it in?

01:09:55.380 --> 01:09:59.510
In chimpanzees, you see
the polygamous vole species

01:09:59.510 --> 01:10:01.380
version.

01:10:01.380 --> 01:10:03.000
That makes lots of sense.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:06.430
They are a major polygamist
species in their behavior.

01:10:06.430 --> 01:10:08.740
But then, this
beautiful dichotomy

01:10:08.740 --> 01:10:12.260
comes crashing down
when you see that you've

01:10:12.260 --> 01:10:17.480
got the monogamous gene
version in bonobos.

01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:19.610
And as we will hear
about in a while,

01:10:19.610 --> 01:10:25.520
bonobos are the most
hyperpolygamously, hyper

01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:30.000
varietyish sexually behaving
organisms on the entire planet.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:33.220
They are as far as you could
get from a monogamous species

01:10:33.220 --> 01:10:36.180
as you can ever ask for,
if you ask for such things.

01:10:36.180 --> 01:10:40.110
And you've got the wrong type
of vasopressin receptor gene.

01:10:40.110 --> 01:10:42.610
Whatever is going on,
it's more complicated

01:10:42.610 --> 01:10:45.340
than the have the
version that winds up

01:10:45.340 --> 01:10:47.260
on the dopamine
neurons and you are

01:10:47.260 --> 01:10:50.760
going to have 50th wedding
anniversaries if you are a vole

01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:52.320
or you are a marmoset.

01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:55.760
And it's got to be more
complicated than that.

01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:57.690
So how about humans?

01:10:57.690 --> 01:11:00.350
And what you see
is not explicitly

01:11:00.350 --> 01:11:03.600
as much genetic
variability as some people

01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:06.080
having the monogamous vole
version and some people

01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:07.120
have the polygamist.

01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:09.440
But nonetheless,
you get variation.

01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:13.250
The gene basically is
about halfway in between.

01:11:13.250 --> 01:11:13.790
Whoa.

01:11:13.790 --> 01:11:16.790
We keep having that
theme over and over,

01:11:16.790 --> 01:11:20.500
all these different ways
of looking at body size,

01:11:20.500 --> 01:11:23.350
and sexual dimorphism,
and imprinted genes,

01:11:23.350 --> 01:11:24.470
and all that stuff.

01:11:24.470 --> 01:11:27.280
And humans keep winding
up being about a halfway

01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:29.450
between a classic
monogamous pair

01:11:29.450 --> 01:11:32.790
bonder and a classic
polygamist tournament species.

01:11:32.790 --> 01:11:36.780
So the basic human version of
it is somewhere in between.

01:11:36.780 --> 01:11:38.600
But you get variations.

01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:41.760
You've got genetic variations
that either look a little bit

01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:45.710
more like the monogamous vole
version or the polygamous vole

01:11:45.710 --> 01:11:46.670
version.

01:11:46.670 --> 01:11:49.810
And what studies have now
shown-- two different studies

01:11:49.810 --> 01:11:54.010
independently showing this--
have the monogamous vole

01:11:54.010 --> 01:11:54.950
version.

01:11:54.950 --> 01:11:59.690
And with the small effect, you
are more likely to get married,

01:11:59.690 --> 01:12:01.870
you are more likely
to remain married,

01:12:01.870 --> 01:12:03.960
and both you and
your partner are

01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:08.600
more likely to rate the
marriage as stable and happy.

01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:10.980
That's kind of interesting.

01:12:10.980 --> 01:12:14.260
Finally, in terms of
the role of vasopressin,

01:12:14.260 --> 01:12:17.380
in terms of attachment
in males, all of that,

01:12:17.380 --> 01:12:20.170
and in terms of
social connectiveness,

01:12:20.170 --> 01:12:22.930
a large body of
studies now have shown

01:12:22.930 --> 01:12:26.220
mutations in the
vasopressin receptor gene.

01:12:26.220 --> 01:12:26.720
OK.

01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:31.140
Anybody want to guess
what disorder you find it?

01:12:31.140 --> 01:12:33.724
I put that in the
extended notes, haven't I?

01:12:33.724 --> 01:12:34.890
People have read it already.

01:12:34.890 --> 01:12:36.350
I know, I fell for it last time.

01:12:36.350 --> 01:12:38.560
I am not falling for
that stupid trick

01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:41.810
again of asking you to prove.

01:12:41.810 --> 01:12:43.320
He sniffed some oxytocin.

01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:45.660
So does anybody want to
guess which the-- OK.

01:12:45.660 --> 01:12:48.160
What do you now all
know is there's now

01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:50.650
been a lot of
demonstrations of mutations

01:12:50.650 --> 01:12:53.360
in the vasopressin
receptor gene in family

01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:58.760
pedigrees with autism, a disease
of very, very little attachment

01:12:58.760 --> 01:13:00.050
to other humans.

01:13:00.050 --> 01:13:03.570
So we've got written
all over the place here

01:13:03.570 --> 01:13:08.940
some sort of role of oxytocin
in female attachment formation

01:13:08.940 --> 01:13:10.630
and vasopressin.

01:13:10.630 --> 01:13:12.680
And we've already
gotten interesting hints

01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:14.450
that this applies to humans.

01:13:14.450 --> 01:13:16.750
And we've already
gotten interesting hints

01:13:16.750 --> 01:13:20.120
that individual differences
in the molecular biology

01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:22.080
of these genes
predicts something

01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:26.120
about individual differences in
the stability of relationships

01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:28.030
in humans.

01:13:28.030 --> 01:13:28.530
OK.

01:13:28.850 --> 01:13:31.540
So everything we've been hearing
about with the neurobiology--

01:13:31.540 --> 01:13:34.110
and we're still living in
this part, in this bucket here

01:13:34.110 --> 01:13:36.020
temporarily-- has
been built around

01:13:36.020 --> 01:13:37.930
heterosexual relationships.

01:13:37.930 --> 01:13:40.130
What's known about
the neurobiology

01:13:40.130 --> 01:13:42.500
of sexual orientation?

01:13:42.500 --> 01:13:47.790
What has been found is most
strikingly one landmark study,

01:13:47.790 --> 01:13:50.920
one that got on the
cover of Time magazine,

01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:54.300
one that had a gigantic,
gigantic impact,

01:13:54.300 --> 01:13:57.640
which was looking back at
that hypothalamic nucleus,

01:13:57.640 --> 01:14:01.280
that INAH, I-N-A-H. Yes.

01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:03.850
Where what we saw
before was very reliably

01:14:03.850 --> 01:14:07.690
on the average, men, their
size of it is about twice

01:14:07.690 --> 01:14:09.360
the size as in women.

01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:12.120
And in other species,
males about twice

01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:14.040
the size as in females.

01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:16.610
And a study was
done in the late 80s

01:14:16.610 --> 01:14:19.470
by a neuroanatomist
names Simon LeVay.

01:14:19.470 --> 01:14:21.800
LeVay is one of the all-time
great neuroanatomists.

01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:24.250
He was trained by
Hubel and Wiesel,

01:14:24.250 --> 01:14:26.650
was a professor at
Harvard Med School

01:14:26.650 --> 01:14:29.110
for a while before moving
to the Salk Institute.

01:14:29.110 --> 01:14:31.880
And what he did was
look post-mortem

01:14:31.880 --> 01:14:34.630
at the brains of a bunch of
individuals where he knew

01:14:34.630 --> 01:14:36.900
the sexual orientation, men.

01:14:36.900 --> 01:14:41.180
And what he showed was gay
men, on the average, had

01:14:41.180 --> 01:14:45.270
this nucleus on the
average was half the size

01:14:45.270 --> 01:14:48.060
that you saw in
heterosexual men.

01:14:48.060 --> 01:14:50.940
On the average, it was
about the same size

01:14:50.940 --> 01:14:53.800
as you saw in
heterosexual women.

01:14:53.800 --> 01:14:56.330
Amazing landmark study.

01:14:56.330 --> 01:14:59.670
Everybody learned about
the homosexual brain

01:14:59.670 --> 01:15:00.800
from this study.

01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:03.850
Hugely widely reported.

01:15:03.850 --> 01:15:06.680
And this is kind of interesting.

01:15:06.680 --> 01:15:07.180
OK.

01:15:07.180 --> 01:15:08.360
What's interesting about it?

01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:12.690
First off, the question you need
to ask is how much variability?

01:15:12.690 --> 01:15:13.510
Fair amount.

01:15:13.510 --> 01:15:15.890
It wasn't all that
reliable of a difference.

01:15:15.890 --> 01:15:19.920
On the average, it was
about a half the size.

01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:21.295
Next thing you
would want to know

01:15:21.295 --> 01:15:24.480
is, has anybody
replicated it since then?

01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:25.830
Yes.

01:15:25.830 --> 01:15:27.340
Next thing you
would want to know

01:15:27.340 --> 01:15:30.180
is, where did LeVay
get the brains from?

01:15:30.180 --> 01:15:32.310
And these were
predominantly from gay men

01:15:32.310 --> 01:15:33.940
who had died of AIDS.

01:15:33.940 --> 01:15:35.570
Is that a confound?

01:15:35.570 --> 01:15:39.430
Is that going to perhaps
atrophy this part of the brain?

01:15:39.430 --> 01:15:40.540
Nobody knows.

01:15:40.540 --> 01:15:43.610
So that remains as a
caveat in that study.

01:15:43.610 --> 01:15:46.980
What was striking
though was everybody

01:15:46.980 --> 01:15:48.740
learned about this finding.

01:15:48.740 --> 01:15:50.370
This became famous.

01:15:50.370 --> 01:15:52.880
LeVay became extremely
famous for this.

01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:54.380
And what was also
very interesting

01:15:54.380 --> 01:15:57.950
about it was the political
context of this finding.

01:15:57.950 --> 01:16:00.750
A few years before
that, another group

01:16:00.750 --> 01:16:04.420
had reported another
difference in the hypothalamus

01:16:04.420 --> 01:16:06.520
based on sexual orientation.

01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:12.640
And this was-- there it is.

01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:15.100
And what you found was in
this part of the brain,

01:16:15.100 --> 01:16:20.210
on the average, it would tend
be bigger in women than in men.

01:16:20.210 --> 01:16:23.900
And what these guys
reported was in gay men,

01:16:23.900 --> 01:16:28.230
it tended to be bigger
than in straight men.

01:16:28.230 --> 01:16:30.010
What was puzzling
about the study

01:16:30.010 --> 01:16:32.730
was this was a part of
a hypothalamus having

01:16:32.730 --> 01:16:35.840
to do with regulation
of your kidneys.

01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:38.950
And it was totally ignored
and completely bizarre,

01:16:38.950 --> 01:16:40.540
except there was
one thing that was

01:16:40.540 --> 01:16:42.730
done with it, which
was this was viewed

01:16:42.730 --> 01:16:46.670
as a totally offensive
study in the gay community.

01:16:46.670 --> 01:16:49.160
This was viewed as an
attempt by scientists

01:16:49.160 --> 01:16:53.640
to pathologize sexual
orientation, to say, you see,

01:16:53.640 --> 01:16:58.130
we found something wrong in
the brains of homosexual men.

01:16:58.130 --> 01:17:01.410
This part of the brain is
bigger than it should be.

01:17:01.410 --> 01:17:03.400
It's bigger than
it's supposed to be.

01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:06.190
There's probably two
reasons why that occurred.

01:17:06.190 --> 01:17:09.730
The first one was that
the scientists who did it

01:17:09.730 --> 01:17:11.430
were straight.

01:17:11.430 --> 01:17:14.530
And the second reason being
that they were a Dutch group.

01:17:14.530 --> 01:17:17.260
And I am willing to
bet unconsciously there

01:17:17.260 --> 01:17:22.350
was something central European
Nazi echoes of Germanic

01:17:22.350 --> 01:17:25.490
sounding authors producing
this finding, which there

01:17:25.490 --> 01:17:28.750
is no shortage of history in
the gay community for being

01:17:28.750 --> 01:17:31.650
skittish about Nazi
notions of what normality

01:17:31.650 --> 01:17:34.350
is in human behavior
and human brains.

01:17:34.350 --> 01:17:38.650
This finding got widely
condemned in the gay community.

01:17:38.650 --> 01:17:43.820
Out came LeVay with his
finding, and he became the most

01:17:43.820 --> 01:17:48.600
beloved neuroanatomist ever in
the history of gay communities.

01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:51.310
One probably important
feature reason for it

01:17:51.310 --> 01:17:54.860
is that LeVay was
gay, very openly so.

01:17:54.860 --> 01:17:58.830
Another reason was the part of
the brain he found made sense.

01:17:58.830 --> 01:18:02.370
It had something to do with
sexual behavior as opposed

01:18:02.370 --> 01:18:04.710
to the totally puzzling thing.

01:18:04.710 --> 01:18:06.440
So what was this about?

01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:09.790
Very interestingly, the
explanation almost certainly

01:18:09.790 --> 01:18:12.780
is that this was the
part of the hypothalamus

01:18:12.780 --> 01:18:15.800
next door to the area
that LeVay studied.

01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:19.950
And if this part were
smaller in gay men

01:18:19.950 --> 01:18:23.380
simply because of just
physical constraints stuff,

01:18:23.380 --> 01:18:25.710
this part could get
bigger in gay men.

01:18:25.710 --> 01:18:27.890
Because this one was
taking up less area.

01:18:27.890 --> 01:18:29.800
That's probably
what was going on.

01:18:29.800 --> 01:18:33.820
What's really fascinating
though is the political context

01:18:33.820 --> 01:18:35.760
that this research was done in.

01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:38.970
And this was that first group,
the senior author of it,

01:18:38.970 --> 01:18:40.850
a man named Dick Schwab.

01:18:40.850 --> 01:18:44.730
And he got death threats
because of that study reporting,

01:18:44.730 --> 01:18:48.500
ooh, here is-- easily
interpreted as-- something

01:18:48.500 --> 01:18:51.380
wrong in the brains of gay man.

01:18:51.380 --> 01:18:55.120
And Simon LeVay became
the hero in the community.

01:18:55.120 --> 01:18:57.820
This was utterly embraced
by the community.

01:18:57.820 --> 01:19:00.990
Because in large part,
how it was interpreted as,

01:19:00.990 --> 01:19:02.730
this is biology.

01:19:02.730 --> 01:19:04.160
This isn't choice.

01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:05.510
This is biology.

01:19:05.510 --> 01:19:06.660
Look at this.

01:19:06.660 --> 01:19:09.250
This is ridiculous,
us saying, oh my god.

01:19:09.250 --> 01:19:11.440
If we have gay teachers
in the classroom,

01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:14.880
we will turn the Boy Scouts
of America into a gay men.

01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:18.050
Oh my god, if we have blue-eyed
teachers in the classroom--

01:19:18.050 --> 01:19:22.380
the usual argument that this is
absolute gibberish to demonize

01:19:22.380 --> 01:19:24.290
sexual orientation as a choice.

01:19:24.290 --> 01:19:24.910
Look at this.

01:19:24.910 --> 01:19:26.960
There's a neurobiology of it.

01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:31.020
And this was sufficiently that
I've seen people in the Castro

01:19:31.020 --> 01:19:33.550
District in San Francisco--
this has disappeared somewhat,

01:19:33.550 --> 01:19:36.290
showing the half life of
neuroanatomical knowledge.

01:19:36.290 --> 01:19:38.959
But during that time, people
in the Castro District up

01:19:38.959 --> 01:19:41.000
in the city there, which
is a very gay community,

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:44.400
I have seen people with
t-shirts saying-- the other term

01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:47.930
people never really wanted
to embrace this INAH,

01:19:47.930 --> 01:19:51.050
so its nickname was the
sexually dimorphic nucleus

01:19:51.050 --> 01:19:52.450
of the hypothalamus.

01:19:52.450 --> 01:19:54.430
And I have seen people
with t-shirts saying,

01:19:54.430 --> 01:19:58.025
the only small thing about me is
my sexually dimorphic nucleus.

01:20:00.530 --> 01:20:02.950
They were actually
selling t-shirts

01:20:02.950 --> 01:20:06.690
that would say this during
gay pride parades around 1990

01:20:06.690 --> 01:20:07.410
or so.

01:20:07.410 --> 01:20:10.000
Isn't it great when
people learn neuroanatomy

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.140
out in the general public there?

01:20:12.140 --> 01:20:12.840
OK.

01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:15.950
So an interesting
brain difference

01:20:15.950 --> 01:20:18.880
confounded by people
who died of AIDS.

01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:20.960
It's still not clear
what that means

01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:23.850
in terms of possibly
negating the finding at least

01:20:23.850 --> 01:20:25.440
independently replicated.

01:20:25.440 --> 01:20:27.600
Fascinating piece
of not science,

01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:30.320
but the political
context of science.

01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:34.360
This politically incorrect
to an extreme, this very,

01:20:34.360 --> 01:20:36.000
very widely embraced.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.920
One interesting thing is
that paper by LeVay of

01:20:38.920 --> 01:20:40.770
was published in
the journal Science.

01:20:40.770 --> 01:20:44.140
Again, constantly mentioned as
probably the most influential

01:20:44.140 --> 01:20:46.110
science journal in this country.

01:20:46.110 --> 01:20:49.030
And it was published--
what year was it? '88.

01:20:49.030 --> 01:20:51.390
'88, '92, '90?

01:20:51.390 --> 01:20:51.890
OK.

01:20:51.890 --> 01:20:53.100
I'm getting the year wrong.

01:20:53.100 --> 01:20:57.000
But it was just before the
Clinton election against Bush

01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:00.180
where one of the big issues
was gays in the military.

01:21:00.180 --> 01:21:02.550
That was the first thing
that Clinton turned to

01:21:02.550 --> 01:21:03.820
after he was elected.

01:21:03.820 --> 01:21:06.450
I happen to know the man
who is the editor of Science

01:21:06.450 --> 01:21:07.330
at the time.

01:21:07.330 --> 01:21:08.880
And they timed the publication.

01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:11.570
That paper came out in
late October of that year.

01:21:11.570 --> 01:21:14.270
And they held it for
that time because they

01:21:14.270 --> 01:21:17.830
knew that this was going to be
an issue in the election, which

01:21:17.830 --> 01:21:21.480
was kind of cool that they did
that, although some people may

01:21:21.480 --> 01:21:22.410
disagree.

01:21:22.410 --> 01:21:22.910
OK.

01:21:22.910 --> 01:21:24.040
But we hurtle on.

01:21:24.040 --> 01:21:27.560
So what other biological,
neurobiological differences,

01:21:27.560 --> 01:21:29.780
as a function of
sexual orientation?

01:21:29.780 --> 01:21:32.980
Another one that comes through
over and over and over again,

01:21:32.980 --> 01:21:35.280
which-- what do
you make of this--

01:21:35.280 --> 01:21:38.950
is apparently there is a
reliable gender difference

01:21:38.950 --> 01:21:41.110
in the length of
the second finger

01:21:41.110 --> 01:21:44.150
versus the fourth finger,
the ratio of the two.

01:21:44.150 --> 01:21:47.020
And just to show how bi--
whoa, did a lot of hands

01:21:47.020 --> 01:21:49.300
just go up in this auditorium.

01:21:49.300 --> 01:21:51.690
And just to show how
biologically compelling

01:21:51.690 --> 01:21:54.190
the explanation is for
it, I don't actually

01:21:54.190 --> 01:21:58.250
remember which like-- who's
got the greater four to two

01:21:58.250 --> 01:22:00.620
ratio, which sex, or whatever.

01:22:00.620 --> 01:22:02.900
But it is a very--
now people are

01:22:02.900 --> 01:22:04.840
checking each other's hands.

01:22:04.840 --> 01:22:05.450
OK.

01:22:05.450 --> 01:22:10.200
The first wave of-- and now
all this chimp hand inspection

01:22:10.200 --> 01:22:11.660
stuff happening in here.

01:22:11.660 --> 01:22:15.200
And what has been shown
quite reliably since then is,

01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:18.550
on the average, gay men tend
to have the finger length

01:22:18.550 --> 01:22:22.080
ratio of straight women
rather than of straight men.

01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:23.860
A small effect there.

01:22:23.860 --> 01:22:26.920
Another even more
bizarre finding,

01:22:26.920 --> 01:22:31.720
which is there is something
called the autoacoustic reflex.

01:22:31.720 --> 01:22:35.300
And what that is is if you sit
there and plug your ears up

01:22:35.300 --> 01:22:37.980
with your fingers, you will
hear a noise that is just

01:22:37.980 --> 01:22:40.560
coming from the intrinsic
vibration of something

01:22:40.560 --> 01:22:42.220
right there in your
ears, and that's

01:22:42.220 --> 01:22:45.240
the autoacoustic reflex
generating some low Hertz

01:22:45.240 --> 01:22:46.440
sound in there.

01:22:46.440 --> 01:22:50.950
And the rate of the oscillation
differs by sex in humans,

01:22:50.950 --> 01:22:53.240
which no doubt
explains everything

01:22:53.240 --> 01:22:56.990
about the tragic
wars of the sexes

01:22:56.990 --> 01:22:59.380
and why people just don't
understand each other

01:22:59.380 --> 01:23:02.490
by gender because of their ears
vibrating at different speeds.

01:23:02.490 --> 01:23:04.260
But what these studies
have also shown

01:23:04.260 --> 01:23:07.700
was gay men having the
autoacoustic reflexive

01:23:07.700 --> 01:23:10.850
vibratory speed more
typical of straight women

01:23:10.850 --> 01:23:11.710
than straight men.

01:23:11.710 --> 01:23:13.710
Again, a very small effect.

01:23:13.710 --> 01:23:15.490
What are all of these about?

01:23:15.490 --> 01:23:17.480
The assumptions
are it's got to do

01:23:17.480 --> 01:23:20.980
with something with prenatal
hormone environment.

01:23:20.980 --> 01:23:21.750
Stay tuned.

01:23:21.750 --> 01:23:24.070
We will be coming back to this.

01:23:24.070 --> 01:23:26.120
Now somewhere in
there you may ask, OK,

01:23:26.120 --> 01:23:29.490
well what about the neurobiology
of sexual orientation in women?

01:23:29.490 --> 01:23:31.660
Vastly smaller literature.

01:23:31.660 --> 01:23:33.460
Far, far less studied.

01:23:33.460 --> 01:23:36.780
What has been shown so far
are only two endpoints.

01:23:36.780 --> 01:23:40.820
One is the same deal with the
fourth to second finger ratio.

01:23:40.820 --> 01:23:44.980
On the average, gay women
have the ratio more typical

01:23:44.980 --> 01:23:46.615
of straight men
than straight women.

01:23:46.615 --> 01:23:47.990
The other thing
that's been shown

01:23:47.990 --> 01:23:52.050
is the same autoacoustic
reflex thingy going on there.

01:23:52.050 --> 01:23:54.890
Final realm of
neurobiology, rather than

01:23:54.890 --> 01:23:57.950
issues of gay versus
straight, what

01:23:57.950 --> 01:24:01.000
is the neurobiology
of transsexuality?

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:04.020
And that used to be
considered to be purely

01:24:04.020 --> 01:24:06.660
a domain of psychopathology.

01:24:06.660 --> 01:24:10.660
If being gay used to be
a certifiable psychiatric

01:24:10.660 --> 01:24:14.450
disorder-- up until the early
1970s, the American Psychiatric

01:24:14.450 --> 01:24:17.200
Association in their textbook,
the Diagnostic Statistical

01:24:17.200 --> 01:24:21.090
Manual, you could be
psychiatrically certified

01:24:21.090 --> 01:24:21.620
as ill.

01:24:21.620 --> 01:24:25.710
A psychiatric disorder was
being homosexual or lesbian.

01:24:25.710 --> 01:24:28.370
And then in what had to
have been one of the more

01:24:28.370 --> 01:24:31.310
all-time blow out
committee meetings ever,

01:24:31.310 --> 01:24:33.510
they decided that,
no, actually it's

01:24:33.510 --> 01:24:34.780
not a psychiatric disorder.

01:24:34.780 --> 01:24:37.100
And overnight, about
40 million Americans

01:24:37.100 --> 01:24:39.330
were cured of a
psychiatric disease.

01:24:39.330 --> 01:24:43.410
The notion of transsexuality
as a psychiatric disorder

01:24:43.410 --> 01:24:46.320
has had much, much
longer shelf life.

01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:49.020
What's the neurobiology of that?

01:24:49.020 --> 01:24:52.350
To date, there have been
a handful of studies,

01:24:52.350 --> 01:24:55.490
and they show essentially
the same thing-- really,

01:24:55.490 --> 01:24:56.900
really interesting.

01:24:56.900 --> 01:24:59.310
Another region of
the brain that shows

01:24:59.310 --> 01:25:01.340
a sex difference in
its average size--

01:25:01.340 --> 01:25:03.580
don't even worry about
the name of this.

01:25:03.580 --> 01:25:06.790
It's called the bed nucleus
of the stria terminalis.

01:25:06.790 --> 01:25:09.950
It's where the amygdala
begins to send its projection

01:25:09.950 --> 01:25:11.370
into the hypothalamus.

01:25:11.370 --> 01:25:13.820
Another one to those
gender differences.

01:25:13.820 --> 01:25:16.320
There is one type
of neuron in there

01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:20.190
with a certain type of
neurotransmitter, where very,

01:25:20.190 --> 01:25:23.690
very reliably it is about
twice the size in males

01:25:23.690 --> 01:25:24.790
than in females.

01:25:24.790 --> 01:25:26.870
Sufficiently so that
even in human brains,

01:25:26.870 --> 01:25:29.800
you could pretty confidently
determine the sex of somebody

01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:31.550
by seeing the number
of these neurons.

01:25:31.550 --> 01:25:33.030
You'll see, I'm not
even saying the name

01:25:33.030 --> 01:25:34.030
of the neurotransmitter.

01:25:34.030 --> 01:25:34.710
It's irrelevant.

01:25:34.710 --> 01:25:37.050
It's just another one
of those differences,

01:25:37.050 --> 01:25:40.850
a dimorphism in a region of
the brain, a really, really

01:25:40.850 --> 01:25:42.490
reliable one.

01:25:42.490 --> 01:25:47.140
And this was a study done by
some superb neuroanatomists

01:25:47.140 --> 01:25:49.980
looking at transsexuals.

01:25:49.980 --> 01:25:52.680
And what they showed
was very interesting,

01:25:52.680 --> 01:25:57.900
which was very, very reliably
and a very powerful effect.

01:25:57.900 --> 01:26:00.540
What you would see
in their large sample

01:26:00.540 --> 01:26:03.500
size of transsexuals
brains post-mortem

01:26:03.500 --> 01:26:07.760
was people would have this
part of the brain, the size not

01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:12.150
of their sex that they were
born with, but rather of the sex

01:26:12.150 --> 01:26:16.280
they insisted they
always actually were.

01:26:16.280 --> 01:26:17.520
Wow.

01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:19.921
Immediate questions
one must ask.

01:26:19.921 --> 01:26:20.420
OK.

01:26:20.420 --> 01:26:22.330
Well, maybe this
is due to the fact

01:26:22.330 --> 01:26:26.450
that when people change
gender, transsexual procedures,

01:26:26.450 --> 01:26:29.610
there's a whole lot
of hormones involved.

01:26:29.610 --> 01:26:32.510
And maybe that's doing something
to this part of the brain.

01:26:32.510 --> 01:26:35.130
Critical control
that they had was

01:26:35.130 --> 01:26:37.250
this was looking
both at transsexuals

01:26:37.250 --> 01:26:41.210
who had made gender changes and
those who went to their death

01:26:41.210 --> 01:26:44.130
bed saying this is
not the sex that I am,

01:26:44.130 --> 01:26:47.340
I got the wrong body, but
never made the change.

01:26:47.340 --> 01:26:49.270
It wasn't a function
of having actually

01:26:49.270 --> 01:26:52.730
gone through the transition
and the endocrine manipulations

01:26:52.730 --> 01:26:53.470
with it.

01:26:53.470 --> 01:26:56.230
Another control
they had, which was

01:26:56.230 --> 01:26:59.020
looking at men who would get
a certain type of testicular

01:26:59.020 --> 01:27:00.820
cancer where they
would have to be

01:27:00.820 --> 01:27:03.252
treated with certain
feminizing hormones.

01:27:03.252 --> 01:27:05.460
In other words, very similar
to some of the endocrine

01:27:05.460 --> 01:27:08.970
treatments of male-to-female
transgendered individuals.

01:27:08.970 --> 01:27:12.120
And post-mortem, you didn't
see the changes there.

01:27:12.120 --> 01:27:14.350
It has nothing to do
with the hormones.

01:27:14.350 --> 01:27:18.650
It had to do with the person
insisting from day one

01:27:18.650 --> 01:27:20.880
that they got the wrong body.

01:27:20.880 --> 01:27:23.930
And this was a landmark
study, fabulously

01:27:23.930 --> 01:27:26.730
well done and controlled,
and replicated once

01:27:26.730 --> 01:27:30.000
since then showing that
what transsexualism used

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.180
to be thought of
is that people who

01:27:32.180 --> 01:27:35.380
think that they're a different
gender than they actually are.

01:27:35.380 --> 01:27:38.750
What this study suggests is
what transsexualism is about

01:27:38.750 --> 01:27:42.300
is people who got the
wrong gendered body.

01:27:42.300 --> 01:27:47.800
And these are people who are
chromosomally of one sex.

01:27:47.800 --> 01:27:50.110
In terms of their gonads,
they're of that sex.

01:27:50.110 --> 01:27:52.400
In terms of their hormones,
they're of that sex.

01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:55.310
In terms of their genitalia
and their secondary sexual

01:27:55.310 --> 01:27:57.650
characteristics,
they are of that sex.

01:27:57.650 --> 01:28:01.100
But they're insisting,
that's not who I really am.

01:28:01.100 --> 01:28:04.220
This part of the brain
agrees with them.

01:28:04.220 --> 01:28:06.560
Also very interestingly
that study

01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:10.360
was done by the same Dutch
scientists who did this one.

01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:13.790
Again, this is very
complex terrain

01:28:13.790 --> 01:28:16.930
in terms of what these
things wind up implicating.

01:28:16.930 --> 01:28:20.240
Interestingly, that study was
published right around the time

01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:23.750
that the city of San Francisco
did something very cool, which

01:28:23.750 --> 01:28:26.970
was for city employees
now, medical insurance

01:28:26.970 --> 01:28:29.350
will cover transgender
operations.

01:28:29.350 --> 01:28:32.150
However, there is no evidence
that the obscure endocrine

01:28:32.150 --> 01:28:34.520
journal published out
of Latvia or something

01:28:34.520 --> 01:28:37.840
did that like the afternoon
before the San Francisco

01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:39.930
commissioners had their
meeting on that one.

01:28:39.930 --> 01:28:42.280
But nonetheless,
this is a subject

01:28:42.280 --> 01:28:44.550
with all sorts of
realms of implications.

01:28:44.550 --> 01:28:48.120
One additional study
about transsexualism.

01:28:48.120 --> 01:28:48.730
OK.

01:28:48.730 --> 01:28:52.040
How many of you know about
Phantom Limb Syndrome?

01:28:52.040 --> 01:28:53.150
OK.

01:28:53.150 --> 01:28:57.600
You are a guy with a penis,
and you get a certain type

01:28:57.600 --> 01:28:58.730
of penile cancer.

01:28:58.730 --> 01:29:02.270
And what's often done is
your penis is excised.

01:29:02.270 --> 01:29:03.400
It is cut off.

01:29:03.400 --> 01:29:06.460
And about 60% of men who have
had to have their penises

01:29:06.460 --> 01:29:08.730
removed because of
cancer there wind up

01:29:08.730 --> 01:29:14.890
getting phantom penile
sensations, which

01:29:14.890 --> 01:29:17.180
I don't want to know about.

01:29:17.180 --> 01:29:21.500
What you see though is when you
take transgendered individuals

01:29:21.500 --> 01:29:24.340
who go from male to
female, in other words,

01:29:24.340 --> 01:29:28.160
as part of it having
their penises removed, 0%

01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:30.970
rate of penile
phantom sensation.

01:29:30.970 --> 01:29:34.660
Suggestion being that there
is something much more

01:29:34.660 --> 01:29:38.050
"normal" in that case than
when a penis is being removed

01:29:38.050 --> 01:29:43.630
for cancer, a whole new area
of research, very novel,

01:29:43.630 --> 01:29:44.780
very challenging.

01:29:44.780 --> 01:29:45.390
OK.

01:29:45.390 --> 01:29:48.410
So this has giving us a
sense now of this bucket.

01:29:48.410 --> 01:29:52.400
And we are now ready to move
on to, what in the environment

01:29:52.400 --> 01:29:54.700
releases some of
these fixed action

01:29:54.700 --> 01:29:56.210
patterns of sexual behavior?

01:29:56.210 --> 01:29:58.740
What in the environment
is doing this or that

01:29:58.740 --> 01:30:02.080
to the medial preoptic
area or the amygdala

01:30:02.080 --> 01:30:04.950
or vasopressin receptor
levels or any such thing.

01:30:04.950 --> 01:30:08.750
What are the sensory
triggers for the neurobiology

01:30:08.750 --> 01:30:10.290
of sexual behavior?

01:30:10.290 --> 01:30:10.990
OK.

01:30:10.990 --> 01:30:15.690
Right off, what is obvious is
we are in ethologyville here.

01:30:15.690 --> 01:30:19.170
It's going to depend on the
species which sensory modality

01:30:19.170 --> 01:30:20.375
is most important.

01:30:20.375 --> 01:30:24.180
And this is, once again, the
crushing of the limbic system

01:30:24.180 --> 01:30:26.340
equals nose-brain concept.

01:30:26.340 --> 01:30:29.040
Limbic system equals
nose-brain if you are a rat.

01:30:29.040 --> 01:30:30.850
It's, once again, going
to be interviewing

01:30:30.850 --> 01:30:33.410
an animal in its own language.

01:30:33.410 --> 01:30:35.990
You've got species where
the releasing stimuli

01:30:35.990 --> 01:30:37.460
are all visual.

01:30:37.460 --> 01:30:39.530
And we've heard one
example of that already,

01:30:39.530 --> 01:30:42.550
which were the pathetic male
turkeys getting faked out

01:30:42.550 --> 01:30:46.120
by the Styrofoam female turkeys
with the feathers pointing

01:30:46.120 --> 01:30:47.070
the wrong way.

01:30:47.070 --> 01:30:48.730
Visual stimuli.

01:30:48.730 --> 01:30:52.110
Other species are
quite visual as well.

01:30:52.110 --> 01:30:56.440
Primates, non-human primates,
monkeys, for example.

01:30:56.440 --> 01:31:00.031
And what studies have shown
is-- how's this for remarkable?

01:31:00.031 --> 01:31:00.530
OK.

01:31:00.530 --> 01:31:04.370
Here we have-- nah, forget it.

01:31:04.370 --> 01:31:05.040
OK.

01:31:05.040 --> 01:31:07.490
You will take a rhesus
monkey, a rhesus monkey

01:31:07.490 --> 01:31:08.660
from a social group.

01:31:08.660 --> 01:31:11.250
And he's sitting there,
and he can lever press

01:31:11.250 --> 01:31:12.470
for various rewards.

01:31:12.470 --> 01:31:15.120
And he will press a lever
a certain number of times

01:31:15.120 --> 01:31:19.180
to get some juice as a reward.

01:31:19.180 --> 01:31:21.670
He will press a lever a
certain number of times

01:31:21.670 --> 01:31:24.970
to see a high ranking male
from his social group,

01:31:24.970 --> 01:31:26.860
no doubt to keep
an eye on the guy.

01:31:26.860 --> 01:31:30.000
He will not lever press
to see a male who is lower

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:33.340
ranking than him, but
he will lever the most

01:31:33.340 --> 01:31:38.590
to see pictures of female
rhesus monkeys who are in heat.

01:31:38.590 --> 01:31:39.680
Whoa!

01:31:39.680 --> 01:31:41.360
Is that weird or what?

01:31:41.360 --> 01:31:44.340
And the bigger the estrus
swelling on the female,

01:31:44.340 --> 01:31:45.990
the more levered
pressing the male

01:31:45.990 --> 01:31:49.690
will do to be able to see this.

01:31:49.690 --> 01:31:50.960
So that's kind of interesting.

01:31:50.960 --> 01:31:54.180
And this close relative of ours,
in terms of visual stimuli.

01:31:54.180 --> 01:31:56.840
What is also known
is humans are highly

01:31:56.840 --> 01:31:59.850
visual in their sexual
responsiveness as well.

01:31:59.850 --> 01:32:02.570
Visual stimuli as
releasing stimuli.

01:32:02.570 --> 01:32:06.550
What is no surprise
whatsoever is on the average,

01:32:06.550 --> 01:32:09.870
males are more responsive
to visual releasing stimuli

01:32:09.870 --> 01:32:11.850
than are females among humans.

01:32:11.850 --> 01:32:14.650
And this has been
shown in various ways.

01:32:14.650 --> 01:32:18.750
For example, now studies using
brain imaging showing that

01:32:18.750 --> 01:32:23.720
for visually sexually arousing
material that not only

01:32:23.720 --> 01:32:27.640
are men on the average
subjectively more responsive,

01:32:27.640 --> 01:32:29.190
but you get more
of an activation

01:32:29.190 --> 01:32:33.200
of the dopamine pathways
in men than in women.

01:32:33.200 --> 01:32:36.250
What's interesting also
is that in men, you

01:32:36.250 --> 01:32:40.690
uniquely get activation of that
area of the amygdala as well.

01:32:40.690 --> 01:32:43.920
And again, that weird world
of the structure of the brain

01:32:43.920 --> 01:32:47.690
heavily involved in aggression
also being involved something

01:32:47.690 --> 01:32:50.490
about male sexual motivation.

01:32:50.490 --> 01:32:51.620
What else?

01:32:51.620 --> 01:32:54.820
Then there, of course, is the
world of tactile stimulation.

01:32:54.820 --> 01:32:58.790
And what you've got is a whole
domain where, not surprisingly,

01:32:58.790 --> 01:33:01.670
stimulate the right
tactile receptors,

01:33:01.670 --> 01:33:03.920
and it is sexually arousing.

01:33:03.920 --> 01:33:04.810
Are they sure?

01:33:04.810 --> 01:33:06.520
Have they done enough
research on this?

01:33:06.520 --> 01:33:08.730
And you will activate
dopamine regions.

01:33:08.730 --> 01:33:10.830
All of that making
perfect sense.

01:33:10.830 --> 01:33:15.500
What also makes perfect sense is
some types of tactile receptors

01:33:15.500 --> 01:33:18.700
in some part of the body
activate dopamine more

01:33:18.700 --> 01:33:20.500
than other types.

01:33:20.500 --> 01:33:23.580
We are now in the whole
world of erogenous zones

01:33:23.580 --> 01:33:25.070
and that whole deal.

01:33:25.070 --> 01:33:28.630
What is also clear is
that these receptors,

01:33:28.630 --> 01:33:32.680
these tactile receptors, their
responsiveness to stimuli

01:33:32.680 --> 01:33:36.150
will change depending
on your hormone levels.

01:33:36.150 --> 01:33:40.180
And what you see is in women,
tactile responsiveness,

01:33:40.180 --> 01:33:43.780
the extent to which
tactile stimulation of skin

01:33:43.780 --> 01:33:46.870
throughout the body, but
especially of the genitals,

01:33:46.870 --> 01:33:50.730
tactile stimulation evokes
more dopamine activation

01:33:50.730 --> 01:33:52.650
when somebody is ovulating.

01:33:52.650 --> 01:33:56.180
In other words, at
ovulation, women's skin

01:33:56.180 --> 01:33:59.620
is more sensitive to
sexually arousing touch.

01:33:59.620 --> 01:34:02.520
In men, it requires
testosterone.

01:34:02.520 --> 01:34:07.220
Men who are castrated, tactile
responsiveness to stimuli

01:34:07.220 --> 01:34:09.910
goes down in terms of
finding them pleasurable,

01:34:09.910 --> 01:34:11.320
sexually arousing.

01:34:11.320 --> 01:34:14.680
Final domain of tactile
stuff, the specialized version

01:34:14.680 --> 01:34:18.250
we've heard of already, that
lordosis reflex business.

01:34:18.250 --> 01:34:21.460
Again, that's a spinal
reflex, but this is not

01:34:21.460 --> 01:34:23.820
a spinal reflex of bopping
somebody on the knee

01:34:23.820 --> 01:34:25.480
and their leg goes flying out.

01:34:25.480 --> 01:34:27.960
This is spinal
reflex where you only

01:34:27.960 --> 01:34:31.970
get the lordotic arch backing
in females-- arch backing?

01:34:31.970 --> 01:34:33.410
Back arching.

01:34:33.410 --> 01:34:34.424
OK.

01:34:34.424 --> 01:34:36.090
You don't get either,
but you especially

01:34:36.090 --> 01:34:38.320
don't get the arch
backing when you don't

01:34:38.320 --> 01:34:40.140
have elevated estrogen levels.

01:34:40.140 --> 01:34:44.840
Only when females are ovulating
are those tactile receptors

01:34:44.840 --> 01:34:48.620
sensitive to pressure on
the flanks of the rear end,

01:34:48.620 --> 01:34:50.500
and out comes the reflex there.

01:34:50.500 --> 01:34:52.480
So tactile stimulation.

01:34:52.480 --> 01:34:54.840
At the end of the day,
though, without question,

01:34:54.840 --> 01:34:57.360
as agreed upon by every
scientist on earth,

01:34:57.360 --> 01:35:02.100
the coolest sensory modality
for sexual release stimuli

01:35:02.100 --> 01:35:05.710
are olfactory cues, pheromones.

01:35:05.710 --> 01:35:08.840
And thus, we enter the
magnificent wonderful world

01:35:08.840 --> 01:35:13.140
of pheromonal communication
and pheromonal sexual arousal.

01:35:13.140 --> 01:35:16.540
All sorts of interesting
findings there.

01:35:16.540 --> 01:35:20.140
First, at the end of
generating pheromones

01:35:20.140 --> 01:35:21.740
that are sexually arousing.

01:35:21.740 --> 01:35:26.200
What is required in both
species-- in both species?

01:35:26.200 --> 01:35:26.800
Whoa.

01:35:26.800 --> 01:35:28.240
That was an interesting slip.

01:35:28.240 --> 01:35:32.690
What's required in
both sexes-- OK.

01:35:32.690 --> 01:35:40.610
What's required in both kinds
is the right hormones into order

01:35:40.610 --> 01:35:42.510
to generate pheromones.

01:35:42.510 --> 01:35:45.444
Sexually arousing pheromones
in all the different species

01:35:45.444 --> 01:35:47.110
look-- that's where
the species part was

01:35:47.110 --> 01:35:48.490
coming into that sentence.

01:35:48.490 --> 01:35:52.900
What you see is males do not
generate sexually arousing

01:35:52.900 --> 01:35:56.010
pheromones if they lack
testosterone levels.

01:35:56.010 --> 01:35:59.930
Ovariectomized females,
women, rats, monkeys,

01:35:59.930 --> 01:36:02.460
et cetera, who have had
their ovaries removed

01:36:02.460 --> 01:36:06.560
do not produce pheromones
that are sexually arousing.

01:36:06.560 --> 01:36:08.460
What that of course
brings up is,

01:36:08.460 --> 01:36:12.950
what are some of the chemical
constituents of pheromones?

01:36:12.950 --> 01:36:15.810
And this is very interesting
because it brings up

01:36:15.810 --> 01:36:19.150
another one of those weird
domains of neuromarketing,

01:36:19.150 --> 01:36:22.440
pheromones that have
sexually arousing components.

01:36:22.440 --> 01:36:25.530
There's all sorts of fatty
acids that play a role in that.

01:36:25.530 --> 01:36:28.300
But a lot of what is sexually
arousing about pheromones

01:36:28.300 --> 01:36:31.330
in different species
are breakdown products

01:36:31.330 --> 01:36:33.010
of sex hormones.

01:36:33.010 --> 01:36:36.770
Breakdown products of
androgens in males,

01:36:36.770 --> 01:36:39.130
of estrogens in females.

01:36:39.130 --> 01:36:42.340
And that winds of providing
some of these sexually

01:36:42.340 --> 01:36:45.600
arousing aspects of those odors.

01:36:45.600 --> 01:36:47.860
What does that
immediately tell you?

01:36:47.860 --> 01:36:51.590
Your olfactory receptors have
all sorts of receptors there

01:36:51.590 --> 01:36:54.650
that could pick up on remnants
of testosterone and estrogen,

01:36:54.650 --> 01:36:55.930
things of that sort.

01:36:55.930 --> 01:36:58.140
That makes a lot of sense.

01:36:58.140 --> 01:37:00.010
What doesn't make
any sense at all

01:37:00.010 --> 01:37:04.430
is the following finding,
which is perfume.

01:37:04.430 --> 01:37:07.860
Perfume, in its classic
form, is made out

01:37:07.860 --> 01:37:11.510
of the sweat of various animals.

01:37:11.510 --> 01:37:12.880
OK.

01:37:12.880 --> 01:37:16.680
Except we're going to get into
even worse domain here, which

01:37:16.680 --> 01:37:19.080
is perfumes
traditionally, before

01:37:19.080 --> 01:37:21.390
getting the synthetic
versions, were typically

01:37:21.390 --> 01:37:26.461
made from the sweat
of male animals.

01:37:26.461 --> 01:37:26.960
Hm.

01:37:26.960 --> 01:37:28.310
What's that about?

01:37:28.310 --> 01:37:29.450
Musk.

01:37:29.450 --> 01:37:30.860
Things of that sort.

01:37:30.860 --> 01:37:32.020
Chanel No.

01:37:32.020 --> 01:37:37.380
5 is made from the sweat of
whipped male Abyssinian cats.

01:37:37.380 --> 01:37:38.370
I kid you not.

01:37:38.370 --> 01:37:41.650
And this even produced
protests some years ago,

01:37:41.650 --> 01:37:44.160
animal rights groups,
about how we should not

01:37:44.160 --> 01:37:46.000
be perfuming ourselves
with the sweat

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.550
of whipped male Abyssinian cats.

01:37:48.550 --> 01:37:51.600
Suddenly, you've
got a real puzzle.

01:37:51.600 --> 01:37:55.210
Along comes synthetic perfumes,
and the majority of them

01:37:55.210 --> 01:37:58.520
are made of synthetic
versions of androgens.

01:37:58.520 --> 01:37:59.810
Wait a second.

01:37:59.810 --> 01:38:03.530
Perfume is made up of all
sorts of breakdown products

01:38:03.530 --> 01:38:05.450
of male sweat.

01:38:05.450 --> 01:38:09.830
Isn't perfume supposed to
like smell good to guys?

01:38:09.830 --> 01:38:13.080
We have a deep
abiding puzzle here.

01:38:13.080 --> 01:38:14.720
And there is an answer for it.

01:38:14.720 --> 01:38:16.590
Let me survey people first off.

01:38:16.590 --> 01:38:17.170
OK.

01:38:17.170 --> 01:38:19.070
Guys in the room,
how many of you

01:38:19.070 --> 01:38:21.280
basically think that
most perfumes smell

01:38:21.280 --> 01:38:22.150
kind of appealing?

01:38:25.240 --> 01:38:26.710
OK.

01:38:26.710 --> 01:38:29.560
How many of you don't?

01:38:29.560 --> 01:38:30.060
OK.

01:38:30.060 --> 01:38:32.960
Females, how many of you think
your basic off-the-rack perfume

01:38:32.960 --> 01:38:33.792
smells appealing?

01:38:37.411 --> 01:38:37.910
OK.

01:38:37.910 --> 01:38:39.190
Well, that proves something.

01:38:39.190 --> 01:38:39.700
OK.

01:38:39.700 --> 01:38:42.290
Just complete it, how
many of you don't?

01:38:42.290 --> 01:38:42.830
OK.

01:38:42.830 --> 01:38:47.000
The vast majority of perfumes
are not purchased by men.

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.260
The vast majority are
purchased by women.

01:38:49.260 --> 01:38:52.390
In other words, most of
the marketing decisions

01:38:52.390 --> 01:38:54.660
about what to stick
in your perfumes

01:38:54.660 --> 01:38:56.380
are being marketed
for people who

01:38:56.380 --> 01:38:58.450
are going to decide if
it's appealing or not,

01:38:58.450 --> 01:39:01.210
people who have lots of
estrogen in their bloodstream

01:39:01.210 --> 01:39:02.320
rather than androgens.

01:39:02.320 --> 01:39:05.480
That is thought to be
the explanation for how

01:39:05.480 --> 01:39:09.150
it is that most perfumes are
derived from male pheromones.

01:39:09.150 --> 01:39:10.020
Yeah.

01:39:10.020 --> 01:39:13.271
The other thing is if
I were to wear perfume

01:39:13.271 --> 01:39:15.520
it would more so that girls
think I smell good instead

01:39:15.520 --> 01:39:16.680
of for me to think I smell god.

01:39:16.680 --> 01:39:17.255
OK.

01:39:17.255 --> 01:39:17.754
Yes.

01:39:20.420 --> 01:39:23.030
The strategizing starts.

01:39:23.030 --> 01:39:23.530
OK.

01:39:23.530 --> 01:39:26.720
So a whole new world of
potential neuromarketing here.

01:39:26.720 --> 01:39:30.450
But this taps into, what are
the chemical constituents

01:39:30.450 --> 01:39:31.610
of pheromones?

01:39:31.610 --> 01:39:33.540
What sort of
information is carried

01:39:33.540 --> 01:39:37.370
by pheromones, olfactory
communication, between genders?

01:39:37.370 --> 01:39:40.410
It will tell you the
species of the individual.

01:39:40.410 --> 01:39:42.090
It will tell you their gender.

01:39:42.090 --> 01:39:45.700
It will tell you whether
they are gonadally intact,

01:39:45.700 --> 01:39:47.590
whether they've been
castrated or not.

01:39:47.590 --> 01:39:49.520
It will tell you something
about their health.

01:39:49.520 --> 01:39:52.290
It will tell you whether
they are terrified or not.

01:39:52.290 --> 01:39:55.450
Have the sweat from someone or
something that is terrified,

01:39:55.450 --> 01:39:57.920
and as we already know,
it will smell differently

01:39:57.920 --> 01:39:58.830
to the amygdala.

01:39:58.830 --> 01:40:02.310
It will have a lot more
glucocorticoid breakdown

01:40:02.310 --> 01:40:03.360
products in it.

01:40:03.360 --> 01:40:05.530
And it will tell you,
as we know already,

01:40:05.530 --> 01:40:09.580
if it's the right species, if
this person is related to you.

01:40:09.580 --> 01:40:12.780
Final point before we then
go into the specifics of what

01:40:12.780 --> 01:40:16.410
pheromones are doing to the
neurobiology of all this,

01:40:16.410 --> 01:40:20.170
finally, not only do you need
to have hormones intact in order

01:40:20.170 --> 01:40:22.450
to generate the
pheromones, you need

01:40:22.450 --> 01:40:25.160
to have the right
reproductive hormones on board

01:40:25.160 --> 01:40:27.320
in order to perceive them.

01:40:27.320 --> 01:40:30.620
Men who are castrated
no longer find

01:40:30.620 --> 01:40:35.390
the smells of
female ovarian-- OK,

01:40:35.390 --> 01:40:36.791
I'm getting ahead
of myself here.

01:40:36.791 --> 01:40:37.290
OK.

01:40:37.290 --> 01:40:38.956
If you don't have the
hormones on board,

01:40:38.956 --> 01:40:41.120
if you have no estrogen
and you're female,

01:40:41.120 --> 01:40:43.340
or if you have no
testosterone and you are male,

01:40:43.340 --> 01:40:45.510
you will not be
able to distinguish

01:40:45.510 --> 01:40:47.960
the sweat of women and men.

01:40:47.960 --> 01:40:51.980
Gonadally intact people can
at above the chance level.

01:40:51.980 --> 01:40:56.120
Finally, women become
far better at detecting

01:40:56.120 --> 01:40:59.800
the smell of-- distinguishing
the smell of men versus women

01:40:59.800 --> 01:41:01.840
when they are ovulating.

01:41:01.840 --> 01:41:04.810
Finally, finally,
that's not what you see

01:41:04.810 --> 01:41:06.900
when you have gay individuals.

01:41:06.900 --> 01:41:10.540
Gay men are better at
detecting the smell of gay men

01:41:10.540 --> 01:41:13.240
than either straight
men or straight women.

01:41:13.240 --> 01:41:14.920
So we've gotten the
first pieces of here

01:41:14.920 --> 01:41:16.490
with the pheromonal system.

01:41:16.490 --> 01:41:19.790
You have to be hormonally
intact to generate

01:41:19.790 --> 01:41:23.970
pheromones that are sexually
informative and to detect them.

01:41:23.970 --> 01:41:27.590
What we will then transition
to is, what sort of information

01:41:27.590 --> 01:41:29.680
is being carried
in the pheromones

01:41:29.680 --> 01:41:32.800
and what effect does it
have on the neurobiology

01:41:32.800 --> 01:41:36.010
of depending on who's
pheromones you are sniffing?

01:41:36.010 --> 01:41:36.510
OK.

01:41:36.510 --> 01:41:38.120
So we will--

01:41:38.120 --> 01:41:41.370
