00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.976
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:07.676
Stanford University.

00:00:07.676 --> 00:00:10.030
And we are not going
to work our way

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.820
through the behavior on the
right and march to the left.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.150
And instead, we'll
be trying to come up

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.880
with some ideas that are
going to apply to everything

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.370
we hear about in here.

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:27.680
And overall, these are probably
the most difficult lectures

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.340
of the course, the most
difficult material,

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.340
in part because I'm not sure
if I completely understand

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:34.690
what I'm talking about.

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.020
But also because
this is intrinsically

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.030
some really different ways
of thinking about things

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.850
in the realm of science.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.590
And that's one of
the reasons why

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.600
I forced you guys to
read this Chaos book.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.330
And again, as I think I
mentioned in the first lecture,

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:56.520
this incites a subset of
people to passionate enthusiasm

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.750
about the book.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.520
It incites another small subset
into just the most greatest

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.000
level of irritation
that this was assigned.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.550
And everybody else
is just vaguely

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.850
puzzled and kind of sort of
sees the point, but how come?

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.190
This book, when I first read
it, and so my first introduction

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.440
to the whole field, this
was like the first book

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.560
I had read where I finished it
and immediately started over

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.440
again, the first
one since, like,

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.460
Where the Wild Things Are
in terms of influence.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.910
This was an incredibly
challenging book

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.780
in terms of questioning
all the ways in which I

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.910
think about sort of
reductive science.

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.150
And hopefully, it will
do the same for you.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.160
And as part of it, posted, there
is the one and only homework

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.550
assignment in the
entire course, which,

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.410
just to make things easier, will
not be collected or looked at.

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:49.170
But what you should do is there
is a whole exercise up there

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.680
in generating something that
are called cellular automata.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:54.810
Do not panic yet.

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.370
There's plenty of time to panic.

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.600
Where you will be making
some of those on your own.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.310
And all I ask from
you guys in terms

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.280
of making sense of
these exercises is

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.600
do not sleep between
now and Friday.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.330
Spend all of your time working
on them, do nothing else.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.470
Take occasional breaks
to eat or the bathroom.

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.620
But other than that,
do nothing but this

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.100
between now and Friday.

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.010
And let's see how everybody
feels about it on Friday.

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.090
OK.

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.090
So picking up, where we
need to start off with

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.350
is trying to get a framework for
the standard Western approach

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.020
to understanding complicated
systems with scientific bases.

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:38.650
400 or so AD, Rome falls,
collapse of the Roman Empire,

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.550
entering an unbelievably dark
period in terms of ignorance,

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.620
in terms of the Dark
Ages throughout Europe,

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.940
the level at which
people did not

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.130
understand how the
world worked, the level

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.550
at which people had lost
knowledge from previous times.

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:57.750
Books were gone.

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.600
Philosophers were gone.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.370
The level of just isolation,
intellectual isolation,

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:04.760
was phenomenal.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.710
It was during that
period, it was

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:12.170
as if 500 years before people
had known the cure for cancer,

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.370
and for AIDS, and for being
able to fly on your own,

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.790
and all of that, and somehow
in the aftermath of the empire

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.030
falling apart, all of
that knowledge was lost.

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.040
Literacy went down the tubes.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.580
And this was a period that
gave rise to words like,

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.420
having an audit, having an
audit about your finances,

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.590
making an oral argument
before the judges,

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.110
having hearings about something
or other before the court.

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.940
Because all of these
were about speaking,

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.040
about auditory transmission
of information because nobody

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.450
could read anymore.

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.000
This was a period
where there was

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.650
no Western European language
that had the word progress

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.090
or ambition in it.

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.600
These were non-existent
concepts at the time.

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.240
Utter intellectual isolation,
utter social isolation,

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.570
during a time the vast
majority of people

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:09.000
lived in small villages, where
you would go 50 miles away

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.540
and people spoke a dialect
that you could not understand,

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.540
that degree of isolation.

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.100
Estimates are the
average person never went

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.750
more than 12 to 15
miles away from where

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.270
they were born in their entire
life, incredible isolation.

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.250
And incredible
ignorance ultimately

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:32.580
about how you explain causality
in the world because of all

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.150
of the information was gone.

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.820
Then something dramatic
changed in the year

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:43.190
1085, which is the first
European Christian conquest

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:47.560
of a major Islamic city, a
major Moorish one in this case,

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.170
Toledo in Spain.

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:53.000
Spain at the time, which was
Moorish and known as Alhambra

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.620
at the time, this
was the first city

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.830
to fall to Christian troops
since Islam swept in there.

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.860
And this was basically sort
of a second rate kind of city.

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.600
This was not some
major center, Toledo.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.760
But simply by
European forces having

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:14.230
captured that city, something
extraordinary happened, which

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:19.680
was within that city was a
library, with more books than

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.710
existed in all of Christian
Europe put together.

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:27.290
This simple library in this
sort out of the way podunk sort

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:29.610
of the city there
out in the boondocks,

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:33.070
one run-of-the-mill library
there had more cumulative

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:37.020
information than was available
to all of Europe at the time.

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:42.303
And suddenly, Europe got
to rediscover philosophers,

00:05:42.303 --> 00:05:44.700
Aristotle, Plato, all of that.

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:46.650
They got to rediscover logic.

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:50.220
They got to rediscover
all the great works.

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.460
Suddenly all of
those flooded back

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:55.870
into Europe and the
first beginnings of sort

00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:00.540
of a modern mindset about
complexity started to emerge.

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:04.480
People suddenly began to do
things, like able to think

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:08.720
transitive and
with transitivity,

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:14.750
in a transitive manner, where
you would see a is bigger

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:16.600
than b, b is bigger than c.

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:20.390
And you had this startling
revolutionary notion,

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:22.600
which is you now
can know something

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:25.560
about the relationship
between and a and c

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.840
without having to directly
compare them with each other.

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:33.110
This was an astonishing sort
of logical breakthrough.

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:37.050
Syllogism, syllogism
suddenly appeared in Europe

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:39.810
for the first time in
centuries, the ability

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:42.300
of people to do
things like, say,

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:46.950
if all things that
glow have fire, then

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:51.180
stars glow and thus stars have
fire, syllogistic thinking.

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:53.530
That had been utterly gone.

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:56.420
And suddenly, people
began to think

00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:00.240
about what is, where that
had been lost for centuries.

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:02.900
And all of that culminated
in a certain sort

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:06.140
of emergence of what we
would now call science.

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:09.340
Thomas Aquinas coming
up with an amazing,

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:12.340
an amazing quote, that
summarizes all of what

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:13.680
was happening at the time.

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:17.880
He listed three things
that God could not do.

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:21.440
The first two were just
sort of theological stuff.

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:22.900
God cannot sin.

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:25.100
God cannot make a
copy of himself.

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:29.400
It's the third one that
was just earth-shaking.

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:34.940
Third, even God cannot make
a triangle with more than 180

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:36.490
degrees.

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:39.730
And in that one concept,
Aquinas had just

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:43.390
said if it comes up against
sort of the old knowledge

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:46.030
and science, science wins.

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:49.270
And that was an absolutely
landmark moment.

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:52.960
God could do anything, but
still can't make a triangle

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:55.280
with more than 180 degrees.

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:59.180
This was the beginning of the
transformation of the world.

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:03.060
And this immediately had
impact, all sorts of domains,

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:05.650
not just this very
pedestrian one,

00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:08.720
which is if something
broke you could fix it.

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:13.160
That was a concept that was
very, very rare around then.

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.940
But the ability to
construct events

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:18.440
by looking at
overlapping fragments.

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:21.460
A crime has occurred
and there is

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:24.990
no individual who has watched
the entire crime happen.

00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:29.620
But one person saw what
happened from point A to C. One

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:33.039
saw from B to D. One
for all from C to--

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:36.130
and suddenly, there
was this realization

00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:39.260
that you can figure
out what went on

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.980
by putting these various
overlapping bits of data

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:46.590
together, a completely
revolutionary idea

00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:49.610
and completely transformed
the notion that how

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:53.330
do you figure out if
somebody did a crime prior

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:55.080
to this period,
what you would do

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.410
is to throw them in
the river, for example.

00:08:57.410 --> 00:08:59.720
And if they sank and
drowned, obviously they

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:00.590
had done the crime.

00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:01.740
Good luck there.

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:04.480
In terms of having figured
that out, good detective work.

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:06.500
That's how you think
figured if somebody had

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:08.140
done something wrong or not.

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:09.400
You set fire to them.

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:12.320
And if they burned, oh,
they were obviously guilty.

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:14.820
And suddenly this
concept instead,

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:21.000
not only using facts, not
only using observational data,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.890
but that you could derive
what occurred without any one

00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:27.450
individual having
seen the whole thing.

00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:31.060
You can reconstruct
things with overlapping.

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:33.430
This was just landmark.

00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:36.540
This just transformed
everything.

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:38.800
And somewhere around
this time began

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:40.550
to emerge what we
would recognize

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:43.680
to be sort of the
proto-baby steps of what

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:45.490
would be modern science.

00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:49.190
And in the aftermath of this
period came what was basically

00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:51.730
the single most
important concept

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:54.800
in all of science in
the last 500 years,

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:57.283
which is the idea
of reductionism.

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:03.100
To find, very
simply, if you want

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:07.590
to understand a complex
system, you break it down

00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:10.050
into its component parts.

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:13.710
And when you understand
the individual parts,

00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:17.750
you will be able to
understand the complex system.

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:21.660
Reductionism, this is at
the core of everything

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:25.910
that we do in science, in
modern science, centuries worth.

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:28.400
The notion that
complicated things

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:31.240
can be explained by
looking at their component

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:35.110
parts, the smaller
pieces that make them up.

00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:39.350
And what's intrinsic in that
is the concept of linearity,

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:40.990
of additivity.

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:43.360
You got something complex
and you break it down

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:44.720
into its component parts.

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:48.210
And once you figure out how
those component parts work,

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:51.690
all you need to do
is add them together

00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:57.130
and they will increase in their
complexity in a linear manner

00:10:57.130 --> 00:11:00.500
and you will produce the
whole complex system.

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:03.500
This is Westernized
reductionism.

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:05.560
And it came with a
bunch of corollaries,

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:07.480
that we take for granted by now.

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:10.560
The first one being,
in a reductive system

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:13.110
where the component parts
and how they worked,

00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:14.840
just add them together.

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:16.770
And in a straightforward
way, that

00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:18.820
will produce your
complex system.

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:21.550
One sort of
consequence of that is

00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:26.330
if you know the starting
state of a system,

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:28.780
as defined here, if you know
what the little component

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:32.180
parts all are, if you
know the starting state,

00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:34.890
you will have 100%
predictability

00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:39.520
of what the full complex
mature system will look like.

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:44.200
So starting state allows you
to predict what comes later.

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:49.160
And related to that, if you
know the complex system,

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:52.440
you can figure out what
was the starting state.

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:55.360
That there is point
for point relationship

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:58.020
between the simple
building blocks

00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:01.730
and the complex systems
that come out the other end.

00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:05.550
And this gave rise to
an extraordinary thing,

00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:09.030
which was the ability
to extrapolate,

00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:12.390
to be able to see the
answer to something

00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:16.160
in different iterations,
and to use the same rules

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:17.740
and apply them over and over.

00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:19.500
OK, what do I mean by this?

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:25.030
Suddenly this amazing notion
that, OK, if x plus y equals z,

00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:29.000
you will then know
that x plus 1 plus y

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.620
is going to equal z plus 1.

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:33.860
And x plus 2, all of that.

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:36.010
And the same exact
principle would

00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:39.150
hold for some, like, bizarre
idiot equation or whatever,

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:39.850
like that.

00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:42.150
It doesn't really matter
what all of this is.

00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:46.530
You know absolutely beforehand
simply by this business

00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:51.360
of additivity of component
parts that whatever this is,

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:54.326
it's going to equal z plus 1.

00:12:54.326 --> 00:12:57.320
You could come up with
an answer to something

00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:01.580
without having to go through
the calculations all over again.

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:04.000
You could go through
x plus whatever

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.520
and you know it's going to be
z plus whatever without having

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:09.610
to sit there and measure it.

00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:11.540
You could extrapolate.

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:15.300
You can use reductive
knowledge, the linearity,

00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:17.450
going from this to this.

00:13:17.450 --> 00:13:19.410
You're still using
the same rules.

00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:21.640
That allows you to
go from this to this.

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:25.600
Applications of it are
purely reductive linear set

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:26.440
of systems.

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:29.650
And this was revolutionary.

00:13:29.650 --> 00:13:31.290
So that's great.

00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:34.570
You don't need to go through all
the calculations at every step

00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:37.300
of the way to be able to
know the starting state

00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:39.224
and thus know what the
mature state is about.

00:13:39.224 --> 00:13:40.640
Look at the mature
state, you know

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:44.570
what the starting state was
point for point to relatedness.

00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:46.170
That's great.

00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:49.700
Finally, another feature
of reductive systems

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:55.220
like these is the really
fancy ones require blueprints.

00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:59.970
What do I mean by blueprints in
this case that requires already

00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:04.790
a notion of what the mature
state is supposed to look like?

00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:06.670
Which is intrinsic
in what I just said,

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:09.330
if you know the starting state,
you will know the mature state.

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:12.210
But the belief that in
terms of quality control,

00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:14.550
you have to have some
representation of what

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:16.750
the mature state is
supposed to look like,

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:20.230
a blueprint; in order to know
if you're doing the right thing,

00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:21.780
feedback along those lines.

00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:25.180
If you're really going to
do something hard and fancy

00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:27.170
in this reductive
world, you've got

00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:29.270
to have a road map
at the beginning.

00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:31.050
You have to have a blueprint.

00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:34.340
You have to have something
that already shows you

00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:37.170
what the outcome is going
to be when you apply

00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:39.660
these linear additive rules.

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:42.270
And the way you
go about doing it

00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:45.580
is shaped by the blueprint,
the instructions that

00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:47.765
are intrinsic in this.

00:14:47.765 --> 00:14:51.470
This is everything about
Westernized reductionism.

00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:55.640
One important additional
component to it, which is you

00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:57.840
go measure something or other.

00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:02.780
And what's the normal
temperature in humans, 98.6.

00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:04.370
There's no way you
take a whole bunch

00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:08.500
of perfectly healthy humans and
they're all going to have 98.6.

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:10.410
There is going to
be 98.6 and there

00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:12.860
will be variability around it.

00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:15.230
And you could express
that so that you wind up

00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:19.260
having an average of 98.6
and some sort of term

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.070
that denotes variability.

00:15:21.070 --> 00:15:23.230
There's variability.

00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:26.620
There's different
values for something

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:30.510
that winds up averaging
out to something like this.

00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:34.030
And thus this critical
question, in a reductive world

00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:37.850
of thinking about science and
the way fancy things work,

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:40.140
what do you make of variability?

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:42.440
What is variability about?

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:45.262
An intrinsic in this whole world
of know the starting state,

00:15:45.262 --> 00:15:47.470
you know the mature state;
you know the mature state,

00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:49.090
you knew how the
starting state was.

00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:50.820
The rules allow
you to extrapolate.

00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:52.150
It takes a blueprint.

00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:56.560
Intrinsic in there was
an absolute clear opinion

00:15:56.560 --> 00:16:01.290
as to what variability is,
which is to say it's noise.

00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:03.010
It's junk in the system.

00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:04.300
It's a pain in the rear.

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:07.100
And it's stuff you
want to get rid of.

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:11.740
What is intrinsic in this
whole reductive view is noise

00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:15.080
represents instrument
error; instrument

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:17.810
error, instrument in the
largest metaphorical sense.

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:21.990
Instrument, somebody's
observation to machinery.

00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:27.530
Variability represents
noise, represents the system

00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:30.400
you use to measure
stuff, to observe stuff

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:32.960
not working perfectly.

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:37.230
It represents something
you want to avoid.

00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:39.840
And what was also intrinsic
in that inductive view

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:46.030
is the surest way to avoid that
is to become more reductive.

00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:50.690
The notion that the closer you
look to a phenomenon, the more

00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:53.410
detail you see it
with, the more you

00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:55.660
are looking at a
more reduced level

00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:58.600
closer to the component
parts, the closer

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:02.050
you will be to seeing
what's actually going on.

00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:04.150
And as you look
closer and closer,

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:06.810
variability should disappear.

00:17:06.810 --> 00:17:10.859
Because the variability is
just noise in the system.

00:17:10.859 --> 00:17:15.170
And if you're trying to measure
people's body temperature

00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:17.010
by being up in a
Zeppelin and looking

00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:19.347
at people with your
sort of binoculars

00:17:19.347 --> 00:17:21.180
and trying to see if
they're sweating or not

00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:23.030
and come up with
an estimate then,

00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:26.300
that's going to be a lot
more variable than if you now

00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:28.310
do something more
reductive, like put

00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:29.530
your hand on their forehead.

00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:31.140
Oh, do they feel hot or not?

00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:33.450
And thus, there will
be less variability.

00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:36.530
And even less if you now
invent yourself a thermometer.

00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:41.420
This whole notion that as
you get fancier techniques

00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:45.130
for examining a phenomenon,
as you get techniques that

00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:48.120
allow you to be more
and more reductive

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:53.320
and look closer and closer,
there will be less variability.

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:56.430
Because sitting way down
at the bottom of all

00:17:56.430 --> 00:18:01.340
this reductive processes there
is an iconic, an absolute,

00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:05.790
an idealized norm as
to what the answer is.

00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:09.240
If you see anybody
not having 98.6

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:12.440
it's because there's noise
in your measurement systems.

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:14.780
Variability is noise.

00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:17.390
Variability is
something to get rid of.

00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:19.460
And the way to get
rid of variability

00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:21.960
is to become more reductive.

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:25.680
Variability is discrepancy
from seeing what

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:28.850
the actual true measure is.

00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:30.450
And that has been
a driving force

00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:32.810
essentially in all
of science in terms

00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:36.360
of the notion of inventing
new ways to look at things.

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:40.450
More powerful microscopes,
more powerful ways

00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:42.600
of measuring the levels
of something or other

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:45.270
in the bloodstream, all of
them built around the notion

00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:48.630
that the closer we look
to the component parts,

00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:51.960
the closer we will be to
seeing how the system really

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:55.410
truly works and be able
to finally see what truly

00:18:55.410 --> 00:18:57.690
is going on without the noise.

00:18:57.690 --> 00:19:00.960
Because all noise
is is discrepancy

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:03.790
from what is truly going on.

00:19:03.790 --> 00:19:06.410
So in that view, what
you, of course, wind up

00:19:06.410 --> 00:19:09.950
having is an extension of that
in beginning to think about

00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:13.610
how, like, bodies work
in biology and all that,

00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:16.540
as you begin to look at
that as an example of a very

00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:18.100
complicated system.

00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:20.390
And, of course,
what you then have

00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:24.190
in a reductionist view is
if you want to understand

00:19:24.190 --> 00:19:28.460
how the body works, you need to
understand how the organs work.

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:30.800
And if you want to
understand how organs work,

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:33.000
you need to understand
how cells work,

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.170
and cells all the way
down to molecules,

00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:36.540
all the way down there.

00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:39.190
And the notion that the
closer you get to all the way

00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:42.590
down there, and once you
understand things down

00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:45.480
at that level, the
purer, the more accurate

00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:46.940
your answers will be.

00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:50.090
And all you do then is add
the pieces together and out

00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:52.480
comes your whole body.

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:55.990
So where does that
begin to cause problems?

00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:58.210
The fact that the
body simply can't

00:19:58.210 --> 00:20:02.470
work that way, a whole bunch
of realms in which reductionism

00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:07.270
has to fail when you're
looking at biological systems.

00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:10.030
One example of this,
the first one, and this

00:20:10.030 --> 00:20:12.560
is immediately jumping
into neurobiology,

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:16.680
this was classic work, work done
by these two neurobiologists.

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:19.250
Anyone who was in
BioCore sort of

00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:22.040
went through me haranguing
about how great these guys were,

00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:24.530
a pair of neuroscientists,
Hubel and Wiesel,

00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:26.570
absolute giants in the field.

00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:30.030
In the 1950s, up to
the 1960s, everybody

00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:34.120
thought that they had discovered
exactly how the cortex worked.

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:38.560
And what they found was a
phenomenally clean reductive

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:41.990
world of how you
extracted information

00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:44.370
from the visual
world around you.

00:20:44.370 --> 00:20:47.290
I will spare you the details
because it's not important.

00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:49.520
But what they
basically showed was

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:55.490
you could find individual cells
in the retina that corresponded

00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:58.280
to individual neurons
in the simplest

00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:00.880
part of the visual cortex.

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:04.910
And between them, you had
simple point for point reductive

00:21:04.910 --> 00:21:05.910
relationships.

00:21:05.910 --> 00:21:09.140
If you stimulated
this one retinal cell,

00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:12.180
it's associated neuron in
this part of the cortex

00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:14.960
would get excited and
have an action potential.

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:17.770
If you shift your
electrode over a smidgen

00:21:17.770 --> 00:21:20.000
and stimulate the
one right next to it,

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.620
the neuron right next to this
one is going to get stimulated.

00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:28.040
In other words, if you know
the starting state, which

00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:30.500
receptors in the eye
have been stimulated,

00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:34.420
you have 100% predictability
of which neurons appear,

00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:35.580
are going to fire.

00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:37.550
And the converse, know
which ones fired here.

00:21:37.550 --> 00:21:39.680
And you have
complete information

00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:41.750
about the starting state.

00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:44.830
And what they did was
begin to build on that.

00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:48.970
They showed that insofar as
that first layer of the cortex

00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:52.040
had this one to one
correspondence with one cell

00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:55.940
here to one cell there, what
did individual neurons know

00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:59.120
about in this simple part
of the visual cortex?

00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:02.260
These neurons knew
how to recognize dots.

00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:05.130
Each neuron could
recognize a dot

00:22:05.130 --> 00:22:09.190
and one dot only and was the
only neuron that recognized it.

00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:11.830
This was a point for
point reductive system.

00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:15.960
And take all those individual
little neuron component parts,

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:18.680
each of which then knew
something about one dot,

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:20.350
and put them together
and you could

00:22:20.350 --> 00:22:24.920
begin to get some information
about what just hit the eye.

00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:28.920
What they then showed was
the next layer of the cortex.

00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:31.840
And again to simplify
things as much as possible,

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:34.890
what they began to
see was you would now

00:22:34.890 --> 00:22:37.970
stimulate one of
those retinal cells

00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:41.170
and one neuron in the
first layer of cortex

00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:42.260
would get excited.

00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:44.380
Nothing would happen
in the second layer.

00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:47.270
Shift over, stimulate
the next one over,

00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:50.180
the next one over, nothing in
the next part of the cortex,

00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:52.680
over and over and over,
over and over and over,

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:56.680
and then suddenly one of the
neurons in the second cortex

00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:57.810
gets excited.

00:22:57.810 --> 00:23:02.292
If and only if you first
stimulate this photoreceptor,

00:23:02.292 --> 00:23:04.500
followed by this, followed
by this, followed by this,

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:05.300
followed by this.

00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:08.970
What does that neuron
know about, light moving

00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:11.790
in a straight line
in this direction.

00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:16.420
That part of the cortex
could extract the information

00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:20.500
from that first layer and
put them together and get

00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:22.100
different sorts of information.

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:24.960
And, thus, you would
have another neuron there

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:29.014
that would code for an angle
that was slightly different,

00:23:29.014 --> 00:23:29.930
and another one there.

00:23:29.930 --> 00:23:31.510
And then ones for
different parts

00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:34.612
of the cortex, different
parts of the visual system,

00:23:34.612 --> 00:23:37.587
and very long lines or
very slow moving lights

00:23:37.587 --> 00:23:38.420
or things like that.

00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:41.790
What do neurons in that
second layer know about?

00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:44.680
They know how to
recognize straight lines.

00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:48.150
And you could see again,
this is a reductive system.

00:23:48.150 --> 00:23:51.640
Because you know the wiring
that goes from one layer,

00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:53.760
from the eye, to this
layer, to this layer.

00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:57.270
And thus, if you know
what's going on here,

00:23:57.270 --> 00:23:59.700
you can work backwards and
know what's happening there

00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:01.090
and what's happening
in the eye and the same

00:24:01.090 --> 00:24:02.240
with the other direction.

00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:04.350
A point for point
system, where now you're

00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:08.860
beginning to extract a higher
level, a hierarchy of analysis,

00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:11.640
but the same exact reductionism.

00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:15.030
And just to then begin to show
what they then went on to,

00:24:15.030 --> 00:24:17.620
again this is very
simplified, now

00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:19.620
you begin to get neurons here.

00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:22.180
One of them will
respond to this line.

00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:24.260
Another will respond
to this line.

00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:26.090
Another will respond
to this line.

00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:29.250
If and only if
these three neurons

00:24:29.250 --> 00:24:32.420
are firing
simultaneously, one neuron

00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:35.680
in the next layer of the
visual cortex would fire.

00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:37.870
What do neurons
there know about?

00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:41.610
Each one knows about a
curve and one curve only.

00:24:41.610 --> 00:24:44.550
The same exact
thing again, which

00:24:44.550 --> 00:24:47.030
is point for point reductionism.

00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:49.280
If you want to
understand the system,

00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:52.550
you need to understand how
every single neuron is wired

00:24:52.550 --> 00:24:54.200
to every next one in line.

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:57.090
And once you got that,
all you need to know

00:24:57.090 --> 00:24:59.640
is what information,
what activity,

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:01.290
is happening at any level.

00:25:01.290 --> 00:25:04.490
And you've got 100% knowledge
of what will be going on here,

00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:08.760
and here, and here, a
purely reductive system.

00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:09.740
Everybody loved this.

00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:12.810
This was the greatest stuff
that happened in neurobiology.

00:25:12.810 --> 00:25:15.990
This was arguably the most
important work in neurobiology

00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:18.760
between, like, 1950, 1975.

00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:20.720
The two of them got
their Nobel Prize.

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:23.020
People would have given them
a dozen if they could of.

00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:25.180
Because what had
they just solved,

00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:30.450
they just showed how the brain
processes sensory information,

00:25:30.450 --> 00:25:33.740
how it extracts information
from the world around

00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:37.710
and turns it into complex
bits of sensory information.

00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:40.380
Because it was completely
obvious at this point what

00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:42.880
was going to happen,
which was above this,

00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:45.380
there would be a
layer that had neurons

00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:47.660
that could respond to a
certain number of curves

00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:48.930
simultaneously.

00:25:48.930 --> 00:25:51.240
It can start seeing
three dimensions.

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:53.690
And then above that is one
where the three dimensions

00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:54.840
are changing over time.

00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:57.220
It can detect movement of
a three-dimensional object.

00:25:57.220 --> 00:25:59.550
And the notion was you
would be able to just go

00:25:59.550 --> 00:26:03.560
up a layer after layer of
reductive pointilist wiring

00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:07.810
and way up on top, you would
have this super-duper layer

00:26:07.810 --> 00:26:10.080
of visual cortical processing.

00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:12.630
And all the way up on
top, somewhere up there,

00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:15.630
you would now have a neuron that
knew one thing and one thing

00:26:15.630 --> 00:26:18.740
only, knew how to recognize
your grandmother's face

00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:20.720
at this angle.

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:23.270
And the notion would be
that right next to it

00:26:23.270 --> 00:26:25.600
was another neuron that
recognized your grandmother's

00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:27.990
face at this angle,
and then one like this.

00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:29.850
And right behind, with
the rows of neurons

00:26:29.850 --> 00:26:31.580
recognizing your grandfather.

00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:34.520
And everybody
decided this is it.

00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:36.870
Just take this world
of Hubel and Wiesel's

00:26:36.870 --> 00:26:40.900
stepwise extraction of
information and keep going.

00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:45.360
And that's how the brain
winds up recognizing faces.

00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:47.230
And meanwhile,
people subsequently

00:26:47.230 --> 00:26:52.060
showed in the auditory cortex
that the correspondence

00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:54.800
between one cochlear
cell, one hair cell there,

00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:59.350
recognizing a single note,
up to chords, up to OK.

00:26:59.350 --> 00:27:01.200
So now you go up
enough layers there

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:03.980
and you will find a layer
that your single neurons then

00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:06.830
know your grandmother's
favorite symphony.

00:27:06.830 --> 00:27:07.890
And that's it.

00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:09.830
All the way up, you
would eventually

00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:13.120
find neurons that were
specialized in really

00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:15.400
complex sensory information.

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:17.480
And all you had to
do was just keep

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:20.790
going like this in this
purely reductive way

00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:22.910
and you've got it
up there on top.

00:27:22.910 --> 00:27:25.010
And people at the
time actually did

00:27:25.010 --> 00:27:27.930
refer to these as
grandmother neurons.

00:27:27.930 --> 00:27:30.630
The notion that
enough layers up here,

00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:33.990
you would get neurons
that responded to a really

00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:36.470
complex thing and only to that.

00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:39.110
And it was the only neuron
that responded to that point

00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:41.190
for point, one thing
and one thing only.

00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:43.760
And that all you needed to
do was just keep doing this

00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:45.760
and you would eventually
get neurons that

00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:48.100
recognized your grandmother.

00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:50.270
So right around the time
that Hubel and Wiesel got

00:27:50.270 --> 00:27:53.440
their third layer here, and
this took them about 15 years,

00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:55.520
they decided to go
study something else

00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:56.989
in the visual system.

00:27:56.989 --> 00:27:59.030
And that turned out to be
at least as interesting

00:27:59.030 --> 00:27:59.980
as this stuff.

00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:02.196
But everybody else
leapt in at that point,

00:28:02.196 --> 00:28:04.070
to try to find the next
layer, and the layer,

00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:05.080
and the next layer.

00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:07.440
And Hubel and Wiesel had
shown a remarkable bit

00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:09.670
of wisdom or
intuition by bailing

00:28:09.670 --> 00:28:11.210
on the field at that point.

00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:14.290
Because to this
day, hardly anybody

00:28:14.290 --> 00:28:18.200
has ever shown the existence
of a grandmother neuron

00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:20.000
all the way down there.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.260
They simply don't exist.

00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:24.000
OK, that's a lie.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:24.960
They do exist.

00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:26.960
But there's very few of them.

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:28.530
There's sparse coding.

00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:32.050
Occasionally, you find
neurons that show grandmother

00:28:32.050 --> 00:28:35.230
neuron-like processes,
neurons, a single neuron that

00:28:35.230 --> 00:28:38.580
will respond to a face
and only one type of face,

00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:42.130
way up there in many layers
of visual cortical processing.

00:28:42.130 --> 00:28:43.820
There are some of those.

00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:45.890
And there was a paper in
Nature some years ago,

00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:49.450
which was one of the weirdest
papers I have ever seen.

00:28:49.450 --> 00:28:51.510
Really interesting in
terms of what it showed,

00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:53.860
but weird from the
standpoint of what

00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:56.750
were these folks thinking
to actually test this?

00:28:56.750 --> 00:28:59.070
And they were recording
from the very upper layers

00:28:59.070 --> 00:29:01.550
of visual cortex
in monkey brains.

00:29:01.550 --> 00:29:04.060
And they found some
neurons that responded.

00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:08.450
One neuron would respond
only to a certain human face,

00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:11.100
encoding a
grandmother-type neuron.

00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:13.130
Here's the bizarre
thing in that paper.

00:29:13.130 --> 00:29:15.370
What they discovered
were neurons

00:29:15.370 --> 00:29:17.580
in the brains of
these rhesus monkeys,

00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:21.730
where there would be a single
grandmotheresque neuron.

00:29:21.730 --> 00:29:23.363
And what they found
was a neuron that

00:29:23.363 --> 00:29:27.270
would respond to a picture
of Jennifer Aniston.

00:29:27.270 --> 00:29:29.130
You think I'm being sarcastic.

00:29:29.130 --> 00:29:31.690
They found a Jennifer
Aniston neuron,

00:29:31.690 --> 00:29:34.500
which would respond
to a photograph of her

00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:37.220
at all sorts of different
angles, a caricature, all

00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:37.840
of that.

00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:40.810
They went and showed the
grandmother specificity of this

00:29:40.810 --> 00:29:43.440
by showing that-- and this
is in the paper-- it did not

00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:45.790
respond to Julia Roberts.

00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:48.100
It did not respond to Brad Pitt.

00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:49.750
Brad's very
meaningfully with that.

00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:52.430
It did not respond to
Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt

00:29:52.430 --> 00:29:53.540
in the same picture.

00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:57.350
And God knows what was going on
with Angelina Jolie with that.

00:29:57.350 --> 00:29:58.990
OK, that shows
how bizarre it is.

00:29:58.990 --> 00:30:00.730
The one other thing
they discovered

00:30:00.730 --> 00:30:04.060
this neuron would respond to was
a picture of the Sydney Opera

00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:05.870
House.

00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:07.010
What's up with that?

00:30:07.010 --> 00:30:11.610
So this is, to knowledge, almost
a perfect reductive grandmother

00:30:11.610 --> 00:30:12.300
neuron.

00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:16.190
The bizarre thing being, what
made these guys figure, I know,

00:30:16.190 --> 00:30:17.940
let's go get a picture
of Jennifer Aniston

00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:20.950
and show it to the rhesus
monkey and see what happens?

00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:22.160
Where did that come from?

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:24.040
I recall, there
was not a whole lot

00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:26.600
of illuminating information
in the methods section

00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:29.250
as to where those sort
of pictures came from.

00:30:29.250 --> 00:30:31.462
But, so there are some these.

00:30:31.462 --> 00:30:34.950
Some of them do exist, cases
of what people in the field

00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:38.730
call sparse coding, where
you only need a few neurons

00:30:38.730 --> 00:30:43.460
to recognize some really fancy
things, like Jennifer Aniston.

00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:47.590
Nonetheless, the vast, vast
majority of the attempts

00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:51.080
to find grandmother
neurons failed dismally,

00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:53.730
for a very simple reason.

00:30:53.730 --> 00:30:54.400
OK.

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:57.715
How many neurons do you need
where each one knows one dot

00:30:57.715 --> 00:30:59.280
and one dot only?

00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:01.890
You need the exact
same number of neurons

00:31:01.890 --> 00:31:05.460
as the number of
photoreceptors in your retina.

00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:08.050
How many neurons do
you need in this layer

00:31:08.050 --> 00:31:09.920
that turns these into lines?

00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:12.560
Well, you need one
that's going to respond

00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:14.570
to a line of this
length, and then one that

00:31:14.570 --> 00:31:16.200
will respond to this length,
and one of this length,

00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:17.950
and one of that length,
and the one that's

00:31:17.950 --> 00:31:19.580
a slightly different angle.

00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:23.980
You need, like, 10 times more
neurons in this layer than this

00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:26.410
to be able to pull
off that processing.

00:31:26.410 --> 00:31:28.740
How many neurons do
you need in this layer?

00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:31.610
Like, tenfold, 100-fold
more than here.

00:31:31.610 --> 00:31:34.740
And how come you don't
even have the next layer,

00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:37.450
let alone the grandmother
neurons in these three numbers

00:31:37.450 --> 00:31:39.850
because you run out of neurons.

00:31:39.850 --> 00:31:42.930
There's not enough neurons
in the brain, let alone

00:31:42.930 --> 00:31:46.400
the visual cortex, to
process stuff that way.

00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:49.150
You can't have a
layer above that

00:31:49.150 --> 00:31:51.680
because you've run
out of neurons.

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:56.050
In other words, there's not
enough neurons in the brain

00:31:56.050 --> 00:31:59.530
to do face recognition in
a point for point reductive

00:31:59.530 --> 00:32:00.830
manner.

00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:03.790
The system breaks
down because of lack

00:32:03.790 --> 00:32:06.001
of enough numbers of things.

00:32:06.001 --> 00:32:07.500
And what people
have been doing ever

00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:10.420
since then, what's become
the dominant sort of approach

00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:14.770
in that field, is an explicitly
non-reductive approach, which

00:32:14.770 --> 00:32:18.130
is now looking at something
called neural networks.

00:32:18.130 --> 00:32:21.229
Information, the really
fancy complex information,

00:32:21.229 --> 00:32:22.770
like what everybody
else from Friends

00:32:22.770 --> 00:32:25.030
looked like, except
for the Aniston neuron.

00:32:25.030 --> 00:32:27.650
Really complex
information is not

00:32:27.650 --> 00:32:31.610
coded for in a single
protein, a single synapse,

00:32:31.610 --> 00:32:32.900
a single neuron.

00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:37.150
It's coded for in patterns,
in patterns of activation

00:32:37.150 --> 00:32:39.590
across hundreds,
thousands of neurons,

00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:41.990
networks that are interacting.

00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:46.260
So you have a complete crashing
and burning of what up to here

00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:49.440
seemed like the greatest
demonstration of point

00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:52.870
for point reductive processing
of sensory information, which

00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:55.450
just led you all the way
up to grandmother neurons.

00:32:55.450 --> 00:32:58.100
And they basically don't
exist because you run out

00:32:58.100 --> 00:32:59.820
of neurons at this point.

00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:03.490
You can't solve the problem
of recognizing faces

00:33:03.490 --> 00:33:07.490
by using reductive
component partner biology.

00:33:07.490 --> 00:33:10.870
The next domain where
it falls apart as well.

00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:12.410
OK, what do we have here?

00:33:12.410 --> 00:33:15.960
Either we've got
a canal on Mars,

00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:20.030
or we've got a frost patten on
a window, or we've got a tree,

00:33:20.030 --> 00:33:23.880
or we've got a pattern of, like,
long branching of some sort.

00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:25.190
What do we have?

00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:27.750
We have a bifurcating system.

00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:30.930
And the characteristic
of a bifurcating system

00:33:30.930 --> 00:33:34.160
is it is scale-free.

00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:39.220
On a certain level, if this is
what the drainage line looks--

00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:43.170
you know, the Nile emptying out
into sort of the Mediterranean

00:33:43.170 --> 00:33:44.820
as seen by a satellite.

00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:49.530
And if you're looking
at the dendrites

00:33:49.530 --> 00:33:53.820
on one single neuron with
an appropriate microscope,

00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:57.220
if you look at it formally in
terms of the branching pattern,

00:33:57.220 --> 00:34:00.240
you can't tell which
one you are looking at.

00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:03.425
The complexity of the
branching is scale-free.

00:34:06.540 --> 00:34:09.010
So it turns out some of
the most important things

00:34:09.010 --> 00:34:13.480
we have in our bodies
are bifurcating systems.

00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:16.810
All the branch points on
neurons are bifurcating.

00:34:16.810 --> 00:34:19.929
And maybe what we'll post
is some amazing pictures

00:34:19.929 --> 00:34:22.690
of bifurcating dendritic
trees of neurons.

00:34:22.690 --> 00:34:25.650
And they're called
dendritic trees

00:34:25.650 --> 00:34:28.120
because they look
just like trees.

00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:30.909
And when they get more
complex for some reason,

00:34:30.909 --> 00:34:35.380
you are said to have increased
their arborization, using terms

00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:40.080
straight out of treeology, so
neuronal complexity in terms

00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:41.460
of its branch points.

00:34:41.460 --> 00:34:45.050
Look at the circulatory
system and it's the same thing

00:34:45.050 --> 00:34:46.889
as a bifurcating system.

00:34:46.889 --> 00:34:51.290
You've got your descending
aorta, which is ascending here.

00:34:51.290 --> 00:34:54.489
And then it splits into
two, and splits into two,

00:34:54.489 --> 00:34:57.210
and splits in-- and
it a tree, bifurcating

00:34:57.210 --> 00:35:00.370
into a whole bunch of little
capillaries at the end.

00:35:00.370 --> 00:35:02.990
You look at the
pulmonary system and it

00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:06.180
is the exact same
bifurcation, coming down

00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:10.340
your trachea, which
splits into two bronchos,

00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:13.200
and then splits into
branchioles or whatever.

00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:15.270
And it's the same exact thing.

00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:18.580
So you've got this theme
of bifurcating systems

00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:21.130
throughout living
systems in the body.

00:35:21.130 --> 00:35:23.550
And notice the
difference in scale.

00:35:23.550 --> 00:35:27.200
If this is the blood vessels,
we are talking about millions

00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:29.810
of cells making up the
blood vessel walls.

00:35:29.810 --> 00:35:31.690
But here, we are
seeing potentially

00:35:31.690 --> 00:35:34.410
the exact same
complexity of branching

00:35:34.410 --> 00:35:39.390
in a neuron that's a single
cell, independent of scale.

00:35:39.390 --> 00:35:42.230
And you can have just as
complex branching coming off

00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:44.960
of a single neuron as the
branching you're getting

00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:47.640
in a gazillion
different capillaries

00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:50.080
in the tree of
projections it comes from,

00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:53.570
the same exact
degree of complexity.

00:35:53.570 --> 00:35:55.900
So now we come to
the problem here,

00:35:55.900 --> 00:35:59.770
which is so how does
the body code for that?

00:35:59.770 --> 00:36:02.500
How does the body give
out the instructions

00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:06.640
as to how to make a
bifurcating system?

00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:09.750
And this is where you
immediately run into trouble.

00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:11.830
What's a world we're
sort of oriented to?

00:36:11.830 --> 00:36:14.490
In a purely reductive
world, there

00:36:14.490 --> 00:36:21.170
is some sort of set of rules
telling an aorta, that's

00:36:21.170 --> 00:36:25.690
growing like this, that there
is some gene or genes which

00:36:25.690 --> 00:36:29.130
specify the point
where this bifurcates.

00:36:29.130 --> 00:36:31.820
And this bifurcates
and it's two inches

00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:33.370
in diameter or something.

00:36:33.370 --> 00:36:35.450
Meanwhile, at a
later point, where

00:36:35.450 --> 00:36:38.950
it's about an inch in
diameter, it bifurcates.

00:36:38.950 --> 00:36:40.830
It's a different
gene or set of genes

00:36:40.830 --> 00:36:45.480
that specifies this bifurcation
and another type of gene that

00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:46.870
specifies the next one.

00:36:46.870 --> 00:36:49.870
And those are obviously going
to be totally different sorts

00:36:49.870 --> 00:36:52.540
of genes than specifying
the same branching

00:36:52.540 --> 00:36:53.870
patterns of the neuron.

00:36:53.870 --> 00:36:55.300
This is one cell.

00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:58.440
Here, you're having to
specify thousands of cells

00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:01.180
and at what point do they
stop adhering in a certain way

00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:03.070
so you can make a split there.

00:37:03.070 --> 00:37:05.370
And you look at this
and suddenly you've

00:37:05.370 --> 00:37:11.190
got the same problem,
which is there's not

00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:14.810
enough genes in the
genome that exist

00:37:14.810 --> 00:37:17.590
to be able to code this way.

00:37:17.590 --> 00:37:20.900
You can't code for
bifurcating systems

00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:25.800
in a living organism that covers
completely different scales.

00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:27.980
From one cell up to
zillions of cells,

00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:32.860
you can't code for it in a point
for point reductive way, where

00:37:32.860 --> 00:37:35.370
the points down at the
bottom, the component parts,

00:37:35.370 --> 00:37:37.190
are individual genes.

00:37:37.190 --> 00:37:39.900
You can't code for
recognizing your grandmother

00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:43.360
with simple reductive
component parts of neurons.

00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:46.760
You can't code for the
bifurcating systems in the body

00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:50.720
because these will bifurcate
out to millions of capillaries

00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:53.120
and there's only 20,000 genes.

00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:57.070
The reductive approach
breaks down here as well.

00:37:57.070 --> 00:37:59.920
Reductive point for
point approaches

00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:02.010
break down when you
get to the cortex,

00:38:02.010 --> 00:38:05.530
trying to do something fancy,
like recognizing faces, instead

00:38:05.530 --> 00:38:06.390
of dots.

00:38:06.390 --> 00:38:09.830
And it breaks down when you
look at bifurcating systems that

00:38:09.830 --> 00:38:13.700
have to have a plan to split,
and then split, and then split

00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:17.220
a million times to get all
the capillaries out there.

00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:20.660
You can't code for it
with a reductive approach.

00:38:20.660 --> 00:38:24.540
If there's not enough neurons,
there's not enough genes.

00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:28.170
The next way in which
reductionism fails,

00:38:28.170 --> 00:38:30.635
and the notion that if you
know the starting state,

00:38:30.635 --> 00:38:33.010
you'll know the complex version
and the other way around,

00:38:33.010 --> 00:38:35.100
all of that, and we've
already gotten this.

00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:38.380
We got this back when, in the
molecular genetics lectures,

00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:42.040
which is the role of
chance in these systems.

00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:47.310
All of that stuff we heard
about, about sort of molecules

00:38:47.310 --> 00:38:49.840
vibrating, Brownian motion.

00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:53.310
And what that winds up
doing is when cells split,

00:38:53.310 --> 00:38:56.960
it's going to be unequal
distributions of mitochondria.

00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:58.660
It's going to be things of that.

00:38:58.660 --> 00:39:01.870
Sheer chance is
going to throw off

00:39:01.870 --> 00:39:04.830
your ability to deal with
a reductive point for point

00:39:04.830 --> 00:39:05.460
system.

00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:09.780
You take identical
twins and they're

00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:13.920
each at the, like,
fertilized egg stage.

00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:17.260
And what you know in
a reductive world is

00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:19.760
when it splits in
two in this twin,

00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:23.560
and splits in two in
this twin, this cell

00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:26.140
is going to be identical
to this one, this one

00:39:26.140 --> 00:39:29.960
identical with this, all the
way down to single molecules

00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:32.360
because this is a
reductive world in terms

00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:33.330
of how they split.

00:39:33.330 --> 00:39:36.350
And what we know is by
the time a cell splits

00:39:36.350 --> 00:39:38.530
for the first
time, this split is

00:39:38.530 --> 00:39:40.360
going to distribute
the mitochondria

00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:43.410
between these two
differently than distributed

00:39:43.410 --> 00:39:44.620
between these two.

00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:48.620
Even at the first
cell division, chance

00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:52.610
is throwing off this ability
to know the starting state

00:39:52.610 --> 00:39:55.580
and know what the complex
system is going to be.

00:39:55.580 --> 00:39:58.830
So reductionism breaks down
there as well, the fact

00:39:58.830 --> 00:40:02.110
that chance plays a role
in any of these systems.

00:40:02.110 --> 00:40:06.160
The mitochondria wind
up dividing unequally,

00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:08.210
the transcription factors.

00:40:08.210 --> 00:40:10.850
You remember all that
stuff from there.

00:40:10.850 --> 00:40:13.730
The same exact thing
with transposons,

00:40:13.730 --> 00:40:15.650
with genes jumping around.

00:40:15.650 --> 00:40:18.990
You throw in that
randomizing chance element

00:40:18.990 --> 00:40:20.530
into there as well.

00:40:20.530 --> 00:40:23.450
You can't take the
starting states

00:40:23.450 --> 00:40:25.580
and wind up building on it.

00:40:25.580 --> 00:40:27.640
An example in
behavior, a guy named

00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:30.190
Ivan Chase did this really
interesting research

00:40:30.190 --> 00:40:33.600
with dominance behaviors,
the emergence of dominance

00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:34.930
in different species.

00:40:34.930 --> 00:40:35.510
OK.

00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:38.700
So you are going to have a
colony of, like, 10 fish.

00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:41.300
And what you do initially
is each one of them

00:40:41.300 --> 00:40:42.790
is in a tank of their own.

00:40:42.790 --> 00:40:45.720
And you set up a
round-robin tournament.

00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:47.840
You get every possible
pairing of fish.

00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:49.240
You put them against each other.

00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:52.850
And you see which one is
dominant of that pair.

00:40:52.850 --> 00:40:54.400
So you've done all of that.

00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:57.650
And you were able to derive
a dominance hierarchy, where

00:40:57.650 --> 00:41:00.560
the number one fish is
the one that dominated all

00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:03.310
the other nine in those
dyadic interactions.

00:41:03.310 --> 00:41:05.990
Number two dominated
eight of them, so on.

00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:09.930
It is simply a process,
a syllogistic expansion,

00:41:09.930 --> 00:41:12.790
to be able to then generate
a dominance hierarchy;

00:41:12.790 --> 00:41:16.700
pure, I know the starting
state, every single dyad

00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:18.520
and what the outcome was.

00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:20.620
I can now predict what
the dominance hierarchy

00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:23.880
is going to be when you
put all the fish together.

00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:26.740
And what he sees, of
course, is once you actually

00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:29.070
get the fish together
in a social group,

00:41:29.070 --> 00:41:31.940
there is no
resemblance whatsoever.

00:41:31.940 --> 00:41:35.170
The dyadic pairing
dominance outcomes

00:41:35.170 --> 00:41:38.830
has zero predictability over
what the actual dominance

00:41:38.830 --> 00:41:41.060
hierarchy is going to be like.

00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:42.540
Why should that be?

00:41:42.540 --> 00:41:45.830
Because chance plays
a role as well.

00:41:45.830 --> 00:41:48.950
You are fish and you've learned
this transitivity stuff,

00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:52.420
as fish are able to do, at least
in Professor Fernald's lab.

00:41:52.420 --> 00:41:57.290
And they're able to
do, if he defeats him

00:41:57.290 --> 00:42:00.040
and he defeats me, I
better give that guy

00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:01.970
a subordinating gesture.

00:42:01.970 --> 00:42:04.610
We've now just fit together
two of those pieces,

00:42:04.610 --> 00:42:06.750
establishing the
dyad beforehand.

00:42:06.750 --> 00:42:10.760
But what if the guy happens
to be facing the other way

00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:13.940
and doesn't see
him dominating him?

00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:15.650
And you've just lost the chance.

00:42:15.650 --> 00:42:19.410
Chance interactions wind
up driving the system.

00:42:19.410 --> 00:42:22.720
Random movement of the animals
and such winds up meaning

00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:25.100
knowing the starting
states of the dominance

00:42:25.100 --> 00:42:27.630
relations of every
single dyad gives you

00:42:27.630 --> 00:42:31.090
zero predictability of
what the complex system is

00:42:31.090 --> 00:42:33.180
going to look like.

00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:34.820
So what we have
over and over here

00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:37.990
is, amid this wonderful
Westernized focus

00:42:37.990 --> 00:42:40.090
on reductionism--
and this is going

00:42:40.090 --> 00:42:43.240
to tell us exactly how
complex systems work,

00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:45.030
and the starting
state, and the form,

00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:48.850
we're seeing here over and
over in biological systems,

00:42:48.850 --> 00:42:53.520
ranging from behavior of entire
organisms, down to genes,

00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:58.010
reductive systems break down
because there's simply not

00:42:58.010 --> 00:43:01.120
enough pieces in
there to explain

00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:05.420
complex function in a point for
point reductive component part,

00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:08.550
broken down, add them up
together afterward way.

00:43:08.550 --> 00:43:11.560
And there's no way
to deal with the fact

00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:15.710
that chance plays a role
in biological systems.

00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:17.660
So what have we
just gotten to here?

00:43:17.660 --> 00:43:20.750
500 years or so into
this reductive program,

00:43:20.750 --> 00:43:25.520
what we're seeing is if you kind
of are interested in behavior,

00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:27.760
or the brain, or any of
that stuff, what you've just

00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:31.590
discovered is the most
interesting domains

00:43:31.590 --> 00:43:35.170
of brain function, of
genetic regulation,

00:43:35.170 --> 00:43:38.670
the most interesting
stuff can't be regulated

00:43:38.670 --> 00:43:41.140
in a classical reductive way.

00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:42.980
It breaks down there.

00:43:42.980 --> 00:43:44.620
It can't be that way.

00:43:44.620 --> 00:43:46.820
It's got to be something else.

00:43:46.820 --> 00:43:49.240
So what this will do
now is transition us

00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:53.320
into this whole issue
of chaotic systems.

00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:57.800
What happens when you have a
system that is not reductive,

00:43:57.800 --> 00:44:01.550
where there is
non-linear nonadditivity,

00:44:01.550 --> 00:44:04.590
where you suddenly have
a very different picture?

00:44:04.590 --> 00:44:08.040
If a clock is broken,
you take the pieces apart

00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:11.460
and you find the one tooth or
one gear there that's missing

00:44:11.460 --> 00:44:12.590
and you fix that.

00:44:12.590 --> 00:44:15.280
And you now are able to put
the pieces back together

00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:18.690
in an additive way and you
will have fixed the clock.

00:44:18.690 --> 00:44:21.640
A clock can be fixed
using reductive point

00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:23.390
for point knowledge.

00:44:23.390 --> 00:44:25.580
Now, you have a problem
with something else.

00:44:25.580 --> 00:44:30.080
You have a cloud that doesn't
rain enough during a drought.

00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:32.230
How are you going to
figure out what's wrong?

00:44:32.230 --> 00:44:32.910
I know.

00:44:32.910 --> 00:44:35.730
Let's divide the
cloud in half and then

00:44:35.730 --> 00:44:38.560
get better tools so we can
divide each half into half,

00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:39.650
and each half into half.

00:44:39.650 --> 00:44:44.210
And eventually, we'll get like
one molecule worth of cloud

00:44:44.210 --> 00:44:45.256
and a gazillion of them.

00:44:45.256 --> 00:44:47.130
And we understand how
each one of them works.

00:44:47.130 --> 00:44:48.630
And put them together
and then we'll

00:44:48.630 --> 00:44:50.680
understand why
there's a drought.

00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:52.550
It doesn't work that way.

00:44:52.550 --> 00:44:56.260
Reductive approaches can
be used to fix clocks.

00:44:56.260 --> 00:44:59.250
Reductive approaches can't
be used to understand

00:44:59.250 --> 00:45:01.160
why clouds don't rain.

00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:04.100
And the whole point of all
chaos in these lectures

00:45:04.100 --> 00:45:07.560
here is when you look at the
interesting complex biological

00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:09.600
systems, they're clouds.

00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:10.920
They're not clocks.

00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:14.050
You need a whole different
explanatory system.

00:45:14.050 --> 00:45:15.690
So let's take a
five-minute break.

00:45:15.690 --> 00:45:17.850
And we will transition
to beginning

00:45:17.850 --> 00:45:22.330
to look at what chaoticism
is about, about this science.

00:45:22.330 --> 00:45:24.410
Showing that
Westernized reductionism

00:45:24.410 --> 00:45:28.660
is really good for fairly
uncomplicated systems

00:45:28.660 --> 00:45:30.380
breaking down in
component parts.

00:45:30.380 --> 00:45:33.290
The whole world of this
stuff we find interesting,

00:45:33.290 --> 00:45:36.730
it can't work because there's
not enough component parts.

00:45:36.730 --> 00:45:39.010
There's not a blueprint
that has enough elements

00:45:39.010 --> 00:45:41.820
in it and because of
the role of chance.

00:45:41.820 --> 00:45:44.190
And what this
transitions us into

00:45:44.190 --> 00:45:49.350
are non-linear systems,
nonadditive systems,

00:45:49.350 --> 00:45:52.810
where you break something
down to its component parts,

00:45:52.810 --> 00:45:55.080
and you study all these
pieces, and you put it

00:45:55.080 --> 00:45:58.040
back together again, and
it's going to be different.

00:45:58.040 --> 00:45:59.850
They've added up differently.

00:45:59.850 --> 00:46:02.730
You understand the starting
point in the system

00:46:02.730 --> 00:46:05.560
and you are going to have
no predictability about what

00:46:05.560 --> 00:46:09.810
the complex form is about
because the pieces don't add up

00:46:09.810 --> 00:46:12.540
in a straight linear manner.

00:46:12.540 --> 00:46:13.390
OK.

00:46:13.390 --> 00:46:14.830
What do I mean by this?

00:46:14.830 --> 00:46:19.410
As we begin to approach
this, what is chaotism about?

00:46:19.410 --> 00:46:21.020
Here, we have a
distinctive thing.

00:46:21.020 --> 00:46:25.000
We have a difference between two
different ways in which things

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.030
can be deterministic.

00:46:27.030 --> 00:46:33.450
Here's a-- no.

00:46:33.450 --> 00:46:35.265
You're just coming up
with a number series.

00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:40.340
And there's a rule.

00:46:40.340 --> 00:46:42.420
There's a rule which
determines what

00:46:42.420 --> 00:46:44.970
the next number is going to
be in the sequence, which

00:46:44.970 --> 00:46:47.000
is just add 1.

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:50.300
This is a determinist system.

00:46:50.300 --> 00:46:56.180
It is a periodic one, in
that knowing what the rule is

00:46:56.180 --> 00:46:58.590
and knowing which
point you're at,

00:46:58.590 --> 00:47:00.690
someone could say
what's it going

00:47:00.690 --> 00:47:03.980
to be in 15 steps
down the line there?

00:47:03.980 --> 00:47:07.210
And you don't need to say, well,
number one is going to be 5,

00:47:07.210 --> 00:47:09.040
number two is going
to be 6, number-- you

00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:10.460
don't need to do that.

00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:12.930
You've recognized
a periodicity that

00:47:12.930 --> 00:47:16.040
allows you to predict
pieces way down

00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:19.240
the line simply by applying
the same determinist

00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:21.000
rule over and over.

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:26.400
This would be a system that's
both determinist and periodic.

00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:29.390
Now, in contrast,
you can get a system

00:47:29.390 --> 00:47:32.670
which is determinist,
but aperiodic,

00:47:32.670 --> 00:47:35.220
which is where we're
heading very quickly.

00:47:35.220 --> 00:47:39.440
You have some system where
there's a sequence of numbers.

00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:44.570
There's a sequence of places
on a three-dimensional matrix.

00:47:44.570 --> 00:47:45.820
There's a sequence.

00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:49.470
And there are rules for
how you go from each step

00:47:49.470 --> 00:47:51.540
to the next one.

00:47:51.540 --> 00:47:54.690
But the thing is, you can't
just apply the same rule

00:47:54.690 --> 00:47:55.990
over and over.

00:47:55.990 --> 00:47:59.270
You cannot sit here and say,
if we start at number five,

00:47:59.270 --> 00:48:02.430
and given what the rule is, I
know what it's going to look

00:48:02.430 --> 00:48:04.850
like 10 of these down.

00:48:04.850 --> 00:48:07.680
The only way to
know is to see what

00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:09.980
five produces, as the
first step, what that

00:48:09.980 --> 00:48:11.760
produces as the second step.

00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:14.400
You cannot see periodicity.

00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:17.090
You cannot see
patterns that repeat.

00:48:17.090 --> 00:48:19.940
The only way to know
the complex form

00:48:19.940 --> 00:48:24.310
is to go stepwise and apply
the rule over and over again.

00:48:24.310 --> 00:48:27.580
Because the relationship
between any one step

00:48:27.580 --> 00:48:30.650
here is going to be
different from any other one.

00:48:30.650 --> 00:48:32.150
Here, it's always the same.

00:48:32.150 --> 00:48:35.630
Each one is one higher,
straight-forward, additive.

00:48:35.630 --> 00:48:37.630
You just keep doing it
over and over again.

00:48:37.630 --> 00:48:41.530
In an aperiodic
system you have rules.

00:48:41.530 --> 00:48:43.295
It's determinist.

00:48:43.295 --> 00:48:46.850
But the rules are
such that the spaces,

00:48:46.850 --> 00:48:49.560
the difference with each
step, is not constant.

00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:52.520
The only way you can know
what the number is going

00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:55.310
to be like x number
of rounds down

00:48:55.310 --> 00:48:57.620
is you got to do
this, and then this,

00:48:57.620 --> 00:48:59.200
and then this, and then this.

00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:01.830
This is an aperiodic system.

00:49:01.830 --> 00:49:04.150
At any given one
of these points,

00:49:04.150 --> 00:49:06.480
the rules exist for
you to know what

00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:08.730
the next one is going to be.

00:49:08.730 --> 00:49:10.740
But the rules
don't exist for you

00:49:10.740 --> 00:49:14.030
to know what the one
two down is going to be,

00:49:14.030 --> 00:49:16.360
unless you figure
out what this one is.

00:49:16.360 --> 00:49:19.440
You've got to march through
in that sort of way.

00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:20.910
It's aperiodic.

00:49:20.910 --> 00:49:26.630
There are no patterns that can
be used over and over again.

00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:29.300
The third version
is one that people

00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:31.830
mistake for what I'm
talking about here, which

00:49:31.830 --> 00:49:35.640
is a system which is
nondeterminist because there

00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:37.510
is randomness in there.

00:49:37.510 --> 00:49:40.690
And in that one, going from
this one to the next one,

00:49:40.690 --> 00:49:41.830
there is no rule.

00:49:41.830 --> 00:49:44.520
It's totally random what the
next number is going to be.

00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:46.950
And the one after that
is totally random.

00:49:46.950 --> 00:49:50.372
In that one, you have
no predictability.

00:49:50.372 --> 00:49:52.830
You're going to have to go
every single step down the line.

00:49:52.830 --> 00:49:55.070
But it's not a
determinist system.

00:49:55.070 --> 00:49:56.920
There's no set of
rules that are being

00:49:56.920 --> 00:49:59.090
applied over and over again.

00:49:59.090 --> 00:50:03.780
The nature of this one does
not specify the nature of that.

00:50:03.780 --> 00:50:06.060
It's not determinist
in that way.

00:50:06.060 --> 00:50:08.450
That's not what we're going
to be interested in here,

00:50:08.450 --> 00:50:10.430
where randomness comes in.

00:50:10.430 --> 00:50:13.750
What all of these non-linear
systems are about,

00:50:13.750 --> 00:50:17.900
these chaotic systems are ones
where they are determinist.

00:50:17.900 --> 00:50:21.090
There's rules for how you
go every step along the way.

00:50:21.090 --> 00:50:26.080
But the relationship, given
any given step, is non-linear.

00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:27.370
They're not identical.

00:50:27.370 --> 00:50:29.410
And thus, the only
way to know what's

00:50:29.410 --> 00:50:31.740
happening two down
from here is to know

00:50:31.740 --> 00:50:35.030
what's happening one down,
the only way to do that.

00:50:35.030 --> 00:50:39.240
And thus by definition, this
cannot be a system where

00:50:39.240 --> 00:50:42.580
knowing the starting state
allows you to know the mature

00:50:42.580 --> 00:50:43.080
system.

00:50:43.080 --> 00:50:45.460
Without having to go through
every single calculation

00:50:45.460 --> 00:50:47.740
and knowing the mature
state, doesn't tell you

00:50:47.740 --> 00:50:49.700
what the starting
state was unless you

00:50:49.700 --> 00:50:53.470
are willing to do all the back
calculations because it's not

00:50:53.470 --> 00:50:55.740
reductive in that sense.

00:50:55.740 --> 00:50:59.210
Where would this begin to
sort of manifest itself?

00:50:59.210 --> 00:50:59.760
OK.

00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:03.800
Into the Chaos book, and I
think it was page 27 or so,

00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:06.410
that you get the water wheel
coming up for the first time.

00:51:06.410 --> 00:51:09.390
And go and look at this
picture, obsess over it,

00:51:09.390 --> 00:51:11.480
understand what
that page is about.

00:51:11.480 --> 00:51:14.950
Because it begins to
show how these properties

00:51:14.950 --> 00:51:20.790
of non-linear aperiodicity wind
up producing chaotic systems.

00:51:20.790 --> 00:51:21.290
OK.

00:51:21.290 --> 00:51:22.680
So you've got this water wheel.

00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:24.590
And it's got these buckets here.

00:51:24.590 --> 00:51:26.980
And they've got
holes in the bottom.

00:51:26.980 --> 00:51:29.990
And you can have a very
simple steady state.

00:51:29.990 --> 00:51:32.440
You just put in a little
bit of water, such

00:51:32.440 --> 00:51:34.800
that the water is basically,
as soon as it gets here,

00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:35.670
it's running out.

00:51:35.670 --> 00:51:37.150
It's coming out
in the same state.

00:51:37.150 --> 00:51:38.540
This never fills.

00:51:38.540 --> 00:51:41.450
The water wheel doesn't turn.

00:51:41.450 --> 00:51:45.420
Now, you begin to fill
up at a higher rate.

00:51:45.420 --> 00:51:48.630
And what that does is it's
a little bit asymmetrical.

00:51:48.630 --> 00:51:52.360
This is heavy enough that it now
begins to push the wheel down.

00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:54.390
And as it's going
down, this next one

00:51:54.390 --> 00:51:56.110
is getting filled,
and this next one.

00:51:56.110 --> 00:51:58.500
And all the while,
it's emptying out.

00:51:58.500 --> 00:52:03.000
So a constant input of water,
a rate of things emptying,

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:04.960
the wheel turns.

00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:08.620
It's possible to get a rate
at which you're pouring water

00:52:08.620 --> 00:52:11.490
into the system, where
it will do precisely

00:52:11.490 --> 00:52:13.690
that for the rest of time.

00:52:13.690 --> 00:52:16.390
It will turn at a set speed.

00:52:16.390 --> 00:52:17.655
It is a steady state.

00:52:17.655 --> 00:52:19.630
It is in the equilibrium state.

00:52:19.630 --> 00:52:23.520
It is stable such that
if you sit here right now

00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:27.240
and somebody tells you, in
a circumstance like this,

00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:30.210
the wheel is turning this
fast, in this direction,

00:52:30.210 --> 00:52:32.540
with this force,
you can sit there

00:52:32.540 --> 00:52:35.070
and you can tell them
thus exactly what it

00:52:35.070 --> 00:52:39.590
will be doing 4,070 years
from now on Tuesday afternoon.

00:52:39.590 --> 00:52:41.650
It is a periodic system.

00:52:41.650 --> 00:52:43.580
You don't have to
sit there and go

00:52:43.580 --> 00:52:47.040
through every second between
now and 4,000 years from now.

00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:48.750
It is steady state.

00:52:48.750 --> 00:52:52.950
And you can apply a periodic--
there's periodicity.

00:52:52.950 --> 00:52:56.450
There's a reductive
quality to it.

00:52:56.450 --> 00:52:59.440
Now, what you do is
you put in the water

00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:02.040
with a little more force.

00:53:02.040 --> 00:53:04.680
And what begins to
happen is the wheel

00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:07.790
turns faster because
the wheel is filling up

00:53:07.790 --> 00:53:08.950
with water faster.

00:53:08.950 --> 00:53:10.712
So it's moving this way faster.

00:53:10.712 --> 00:53:11.730
And that's great.

00:53:11.730 --> 00:53:13.010
That's totally logical.

00:53:13.010 --> 00:53:15.120
But at some point,
if you're doing that,

00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:18.770
there's going to be too
little time for these buckets

00:53:18.770 --> 00:53:20.050
to empty out.

00:53:20.050 --> 00:53:22.590
They're going to start
having more water

00:53:22.590 --> 00:53:24.580
when they're coming
up on this side

00:53:24.580 --> 00:53:27.710
because it's moving fast enough,
but they are not emptying.

00:53:27.710 --> 00:53:31.760
And at some point, there's going
to be enough water left here

00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:35.260
that it will suddenly
change direction.

00:53:35.260 --> 00:53:36.180
OK.

00:53:36.180 --> 00:53:39.090
It's possible, if you get the
water pressure just right,

00:53:39.090 --> 00:53:42.220
that you can get a steady
state pattern there.

00:53:42.220 --> 00:53:44.240
It will go around
three times when you're

00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:45.560
putting water with a speed.

00:53:45.560 --> 00:53:48.900
It will go around three times at
this speed and with this force.

00:53:48.900 --> 00:53:52.350
And when it has gone
around 3.73 times,

00:53:52.350 --> 00:53:55.170
it will change
direction for 1.7 turns.

00:53:55.170 --> 00:53:58.130
And then it will go
3.7 times around.

00:53:58.130 --> 00:54:00.970
And once again,
it's a periodicity.

00:54:00.970 --> 00:54:04.450
It's simply a periodicity
with two components to it,

00:54:04.450 --> 00:54:06.340
two changes of directions.

00:54:06.340 --> 00:54:08.420
The first time,
you're going this way.

00:54:08.420 --> 00:54:09.920
And, oops, this fills up.

00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:12.260
So you have your first
change of direction.

00:54:12.260 --> 00:54:15.000
And then, at some
point, the balance

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:17.860
is such that you get your
second change of direction

00:54:17.860 --> 00:54:20.540
and you start the
process all over again.

00:54:20.540 --> 00:54:23.900
There is a pattern, a
periodic pattern to it,

00:54:23.900 --> 00:54:26.570
that just happens to
have two components.

00:54:26.570 --> 00:54:29.580
You've doubled the number
of components in it

00:54:29.580 --> 00:54:31.750
by putting more
force in the system.

00:54:31.750 --> 00:54:33.580
But once you
understand that rule,

00:54:33.580 --> 00:54:36.660
OK, this speed at this rate,
with this force of water,

00:54:36.660 --> 00:54:38.701
it's going to change
direction at this point

00:54:38.701 --> 00:54:39.700
for this length of time.

00:54:39.700 --> 00:54:41.450
Then it's going to
change direction again.

00:54:41.450 --> 00:54:44.270
Knowing that, you can
now sit here and be

00:54:44.270 --> 00:54:48.360
told exactly how full,
how fast, with what force.

00:54:48.360 --> 00:54:50.070
And you could now
tell exactly what

00:54:50.070 --> 00:54:53.660
this water wheel is going to
be doing 4,700 years from now.

00:54:53.660 --> 00:54:57.820
It is still a reductive
periodic system.

00:54:57.820 --> 00:55:00.990
Now, you put in the water
with even more force.

00:55:00.990 --> 00:55:03.720
And what you begin to
see is, as the wheel

00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:06.160
is moving fast
enough, it will have

00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:08.210
sort of this first
spin in this direction

00:55:08.210 --> 00:55:09.920
and then it will
change direction.

00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:14.710
And because the buckets are now
emptying out that much slower

00:55:14.710 --> 00:55:17.080
compared to the rate at
which the water is coming in,

00:55:17.080 --> 00:55:20.645
it will change direction
once more, and once more

00:55:20.645 --> 00:55:22.280
back this way.

00:55:22.280 --> 00:55:24.205
And you're back to
your starting point.

00:55:24.205 --> 00:55:28.570
In other words now, we have a
completely periodic reductive

00:55:28.570 --> 00:55:31.410
system that has four
components in it,

00:55:31.410 --> 00:55:33.960
four changes of
directions before you

00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:38.310
get back to exactly the starting
point and do it all over again.

00:55:38.310 --> 00:55:42.870
You have simply gotten a more
complex version of a totally

00:55:42.870 --> 00:55:45.980
predictable periodic system.

00:55:45.980 --> 00:55:49.250
And what you see is, as you put
in more and more water force

00:55:49.250 --> 00:55:53.250
in there, you keep getting
doublings of your periods.

00:55:53.250 --> 00:55:55.520
You will now get
spinning, where it

00:55:55.520 --> 00:55:58.150
goes through eight
changes of directions

00:55:58.150 --> 00:56:01.310
before it starts the exact thing
over again, and doing that.

00:56:01.310 --> 00:56:03.200
And you can still
predict 4,000 years

00:56:03.200 --> 00:56:05.920
from now, 1632, all of that.

00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:07.790
And throughout,
you can be graphing

00:56:07.790 --> 00:56:10.120
on a sort of way
of representing it.

00:56:10.120 --> 00:56:13.160
This is the simple system here.

00:56:13.160 --> 00:56:14.880
That's the single rotation.

00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:17.220
Here's when you get
a first doubling.

00:56:17.220 --> 00:56:18.640
Then it does
something like that.

00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:21.010
Here's when you're--
you get the point.

00:56:21.010 --> 00:56:22.840
You can represent it that way.

00:56:22.840 --> 00:56:26.720
And you see it is still, you
let it keep running like this

00:56:26.720 --> 00:56:30.720
and there will be the same
periodicity, the same pattern,

00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:33.010
that will go over and
over for the rest of time.

00:56:33.010 --> 00:56:36.130
It's still a reductive
periodic system.

00:56:36.130 --> 00:56:38.860
It's just gotten
more complicated.

00:56:38.860 --> 00:56:42.830
And then, somewhere in
the doubling process,

00:56:42.830 --> 00:56:44.770
something happens.

00:56:44.770 --> 00:56:46.590
And the something
that happens is

00:56:46.590 --> 00:56:51.130
it becomes a non-linear
chaotic system.

00:56:51.130 --> 00:56:54.790
As you increase the force
on the system, the force

00:56:54.790 --> 00:56:57.760
here being the force of
water coming in there,

00:56:57.760 --> 00:57:00.870
at some point with the
force of water increasing,

00:57:00.870 --> 00:57:04.560
it's going to stop this
perfect periodic doubling

00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:07.540
of the components and
it's going to shift over

00:57:07.540 --> 00:57:09.560
to a chaotic pattern now.

00:57:09.560 --> 00:57:12.240
How do you define that
as a chaotic pattern?

00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:14.855
It will shift over to
a pattern of spinning

00:57:14.855 --> 00:57:16.980
this way and then back for
a while, and going then.

00:57:16.980 --> 00:57:21.330
It will generate a pattern
which never repeats.

00:57:21.330 --> 00:57:24.490
There's no periodicity anymore.

00:57:24.490 --> 00:57:28.280
It generates a pattern that
is going to be infinitely

00:57:28.280 --> 00:57:31.110
different along the way.

00:57:31.110 --> 00:57:33.370
Because you're putting that
much force in the system,

00:57:33.370 --> 00:57:36.050
it has become chaotic.

00:57:36.050 --> 00:57:40.960
And what is obvious here, as
an implication, is knowing here

00:57:40.960 --> 00:57:44.010
gives you no predictive
value's ability

00:57:44.010 --> 00:57:46.290
of what's happening
4,000 years from now.

00:57:46.290 --> 00:57:50.310
The only way to know what's
happening 4,000 years from now

00:57:50.310 --> 00:57:53.400
is to study what the wheel
does for 4,000 years.

00:57:53.400 --> 00:57:57.430
You can't sit there and
recognize a periodicity

00:57:57.430 --> 00:58:00.430
and just do it over
again and again.

00:58:00.430 --> 00:58:02.440
And what the
discovery of chaos was

00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:07.780
about was that in structured,
reductive, linear systems,

00:58:07.780 --> 00:58:10.270
when you increase the
amount of force on it,

00:58:10.270 --> 00:58:12.440
there is a doubling and
quadrupling and all of that.

00:58:12.440 --> 00:58:14.390
It just gets more
complicated and reductive.

00:58:14.390 --> 00:58:17.360
That there is a transition
point, where it suddenly

00:58:17.360 --> 00:58:21.450
becomes chaotic and the
pattern never, ever repeats.

00:58:21.450 --> 00:58:23.740
And there is no predictability.

00:58:23.740 --> 00:58:26.790
And sort of the founding
generation of chaosists,

00:58:26.790 --> 00:58:29.980
this is what they were showing,
with things like water wheels,

00:58:29.980 --> 00:58:32.140
where you can see
the exact same thing.

00:58:32.140 --> 00:58:34.220
You have a cylinder.

00:58:34.220 --> 00:58:36.030
And what you're
applying in here--

00:58:36.030 --> 00:58:37.190
and it's filled with water.

00:58:37.190 --> 00:58:39.320
And you're applying
heat to the system.

00:58:39.320 --> 00:58:43.210
And what you begin to get
after awhile is convections

00:58:43.210 --> 00:58:44.580
or whatever.

00:58:44.580 --> 00:58:45.500
Stuff moves.

00:58:45.500 --> 00:58:48.280
And as you heat it even
more, changes direction.

00:58:48.280 --> 00:58:49.410
It's the same thing.

00:58:49.410 --> 00:58:51.670
And at some point, when
the heat gets high enough,

00:58:51.670 --> 00:58:53.850
it breaks into boiling.

00:58:53.850 --> 00:58:55.620
It breaks into turbulence.

00:58:55.620 --> 00:59:00.150
It breaks into a chaotic system,
where there's no periodicity.

00:59:00.150 --> 00:59:02.210
There is no repeating
of these patterns.

00:59:02.210 --> 00:59:05.810
And an amazing insight by
one of the first people

00:59:05.810 --> 00:59:09.490
in the field, this guy
Yorke, was that any time you

00:59:09.490 --> 00:59:13.080
see periodicity
of an odd number,

00:59:13.080 --> 00:59:16.680
you've just guaranteed that
you've entered chaotic terrain.

00:59:16.680 --> 00:59:19.410
That, as he called
it, period three,

00:59:19.410 --> 00:59:22.680
as soon as you're going
instead of a single period,

00:59:22.680 --> 00:59:25.270
a double, four, eight,
whatever, as soon

00:59:25.270 --> 00:59:29.190
as you see the first evidence
assumes any system like this

00:59:29.190 --> 00:59:33.450
begins to have three components
before the pattern repeats,

00:59:33.450 --> 00:59:38.080
it's about to disappear
into a chaoticism.

00:59:38.080 --> 00:59:41.050
So this is what a chaotic
system is about, which

00:59:41.050 --> 00:59:43.910
is you have a starting state.

00:59:43.910 --> 00:59:46.470
And as you increase the
force on the system,

00:59:46.470 --> 00:59:49.820
the periodicity, the
predictability, breaks down.

00:59:49.820 --> 00:59:52.570
And eventually, you get
as the critical thing,

00:59:52.570 --> 00:59:55.720
a pattern which never repeats.

00:59:55.720 --> 00:59:59.230
And thus, the only way to
know what that pattern will

00:59:59.230 --> 01:00:02.500
be doing x amount of
time down the line

01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:06.240
is to run the system
from now until time x.

01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:08.680
There is no
predictability from here

01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:10.450
as to what's happening at x.

01:00:10.450 --> 01:00:12.790
You gotta sit there
and march through it

01:00:12.790 --> 01:00:16.290
because it's an aperiodic
system, rather than one

01:00:16.290 --> 01:00:17.940
like this.

01:00:17.940 --> 01:00:21.580
So what the entire sort of
starting point for chaosists

01:00:21.580 --> 01:00:24.870
was, that you get these
nonlinear systems.

01:00:24.870 --> 01:00:27.930
And people had been noting them,
mathematicians, physicists,

01:00:27.930 --> 01:00:30.850
whatever, in systems like
that for a long time.

01:00:30.850 --> 01:00:33.770
And the longer they do,
right around the point

01:00:33.770 --> 01:00:35.900
that things would
become chaotic,

01:00:35.900 --> 01:00:39.720
they would say, well, this is
just getting perturbed by now.

01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:42.320
It's not functioning
properly anymore

01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:46.190
because it's not working in
a linear, periodic manner.

01:00:46.190 --> 01:00:49.260
Something's wrong with
the system, something

01:00:49.260 --> 01:00:52.320
along the lines of
noise and variability.

01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:56.010
We will stop studying
it up to that point.

01:00:56.010 --> 01:00:58.670
And if you say, we're
going to stop studying it

01:00:58.670 --> 01:01:01.500
until it gets to that point,
the last bit of periodicity,

01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:05.180
what do you come away with, a
very distorted view that all

01:01:05.180 --> 01:01:06.940
the interesting
things in the world

01:01:06.940 --> 01:01:09.720
work in reductive
periodic systems.

01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:11.660
Because what you've
just done is say,

01:01:11.660 --> 01:01:13.940
I'm getting totally
disturbed by these nonlinear

01:01:13.940 --> 01:01:16.540
chaotic things that
happen at an extreme.

01:01:16.540 --> 01:01:19.820
So I'm going to decide
they are just anomalies.

01:01:19.820 --> 01:01:22.140
And we're only going
to study in this domain

01:01:22.140 --> 01:01:24.570
and reach the conclusion
that the entire world works

01:01:24.570 --> 01:01:26.100
in this domain.

01:01:26.100 --> 01:01:30.640
Kind of like behavior
geneticists, who say, oh,

01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:33.340
I want to understand the
heritability of a trait.

01:01:33.340 --> 01:01:35.560
And I want to understand
it very cleanly.

01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:39.550
So we're going to study it
in only one environment.

01:01:39.550 --> 01:01:41.790
Because if you study in
a bunch of environments,

01:01:41.790 --> 01:01:44.940
it gets noisy, and
variable, and messy data.

01:01:44.940 --> 01:01:45.930
No, it doesn't.

01:01:45.930 --> 01:01:49.470
It is showing you that
the heritability is zilch.

01:01:49.470 --> 01:01:53.680
It's showing you that you have
just artificially excluded

01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:56.920
your ability to see
what's actually happening.

01:01:56.920 --> 01:01:59.350
And the founding
generation of the chaosists

01:01:59.350 --> 01:02:01.490
took the stance
that what you've got

01:02:01.490 --> 01:02:04.960
is all the interesting
stuff about complex systems

01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:09.060
out there, are all functioning
out in the chaotic realm.

01:02:09.060 --> 01:02:11.820
And what science has been
spending forever doing

01:02:11.820 --> 01:02:14.920
is looking the other way and
pretending it's not there.

01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:18.290
And restricting the
studying of complex systems

01:02:18.290 --> 01:02:21.300
to just these first
baby step domains

01:02:21.300 --> 01:02:23.430
of the periodic doubling.

01:02:23.430 --> 01:02:25.800
Most of the world is doing this.

01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:31.130
And most of science has worked
very, very hard to ignore this.

01:02:31.130 --> 01:02:34.620
So once you get this, you begin
to get some really interesting

01:02:34.620 --> 01:02:35.920
implications.

01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:37.390
So now you find a way.

01:02:37.390 --> 01:02:40.120
You get one of these
chaotic systems

01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:42.500
and you first study
it when it is still

01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:45.050
in the nice straightforward
periodic way.

01:02:45.050 --> 01:02:46.740
A little bit of
water is coming in.

01:02:46.740 --> 01:02:48.920
And it's turning like
this, at a set speed.

01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:50.750
And come back 4,000
years from now

01:02:50.750 --> 01:02:52.730
and it will still be
doing it the exact thing.

01:02:52.730 --> 01:02:55.960
It's a great periodic system.

01:02:55.960 --> 01:02:59.930
And you can come up with a
graph of which direction it's

01:02:59.930 --> 01:03:02.880
turning, would be here or here.

01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:05.170
And how fast, with what
work force, whatever.

01:03:05.170 --> 01:03:08.510
And you will come up
with a single dot, which

01:03:08.510 --> 01:03:13.720
represents this rotating in this
direction, at this set speed.

01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:16.840
And this is this point
of stability, this point

01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:18.720
of complete predictability.

01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:21.900
A feature of a periodic
system like this,

01:03:21.900 --> 01:03:24.810
when it's in this boring
linear reductive way,

01:03:24.810 --> 01:03:27.800
is you can mess with it.

01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:29.500
And after a little
bit of time, it

01:03:29.500 --> 01:03:31.830
will settle back
into the same system.

01:03:31.830 --> 01:03:35.600
You briefly hold the water wheel
and that throws things off.

01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:38.160
And then you let it go and it
goes back to what it was doing.

01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:39.880
And it will take a
little bit of time

01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:42.130
for it to go back
to where it started.

01:03:42.130 --> 01:03:43.750
And a way of viewing
this graphically

01:03:43.750 --> 01:03:45.210
is it's doing this forever.

01:03:45.210 --> 01:03:46.640
And now, you go mess with it.

01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:47.370
You hold it.

01:03:47.370 --> 01:03:49.650
You turn off the water
for a second, whatever.

01:03:49.650 --> 01:03:53.170
And for a while, it does
this, and it does this,

01:03:53.170 --> 01:03:54.680
and does this, and does this.

01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:58.090
And eventually, it gets
pulled back to this spot.

01:03:58.090 --> 01:04:02.640
It goes back to this point of
stability, of predictability.

01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:06.920
It is attracted to this point.

01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:10.950
And, thus, the linear systems
like this have attractors.

01:04:10.950 --> 01:04:14.060
Something where, when
you mess with it,

01:04:14.060 --> 01:04:17.920
the system will equilibrate
and go back to where it was,

01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:22.202
attracted to the "real"
solution to the problem.

01:04:22.202 --> 01:04:24.160
And if you are looking
at it at any point here,

01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:26.320
and it's not here, because
it is here instead,

01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:28.240
and it is here instead,
and here instead,

01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:30.780
all that is noise in the system.

01:04:30.780 --> 01:04:33.100
And you're in the process
of getting rid of the noise,

01:04:33.100 --> 01:04:38.810
back to the pure, perfect state,
the pure, perfect description

01:04:38.810 --> 01:04:41.800
of how the system works.

01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:45.260
So now, you look at what's
going on when instead you've

01:04:45.260 --> 01:04:48.870
got it to the point of
chaos, a chaotic system.

01:04:48.870 --> 01:04:53.520
And what you see is--
OK, let's assume that was

01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:55.210
where the attractor was.

01:04:55.210 --> 01:04:57.990
And what you see is
when you're mapping

01:04:57.990 --> 01:05:00.820
the speed, the direction
that it's turning,

01:05:00.820 --> 01:05:03.540
the force, all of
that, it's doing this.

01:05:03.540 --> 01:05:05.709
And it will do this for a
while, and will do this.

01:05:05.709 --> 01:05:08.000
And it will reach that critical
point where suddenly it

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:09.370
changes direction.

01:05:09.370 --> 01:05:11.140
And will do this for
a while, and then it

01:05:11.140 --> 01:05:13.880
will change direction again,
and then this, and this.

01:05:13.880 --> 01:05:17.440
And what you have is this
butterfly wing pattern,

01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:21.030
that became one of the
iconic images in early chaos.

01:05:21.030 --> 01:05:23.170
What do you have here?

01:05:23.170 --> 01:05:26.610
You've got a description of
how the system is working now.

01:05:26.610 --> 01:05:28.910
Once it's hit this
chaotism, it's

01:05:28.910 --> 01:05:33.020
not settling down into
a repeating pattern.

01:05:33.020 --> 01:05:36.490
The fact that it is never
here, and staying there,

01:05:36.490 --> 01:05:39.200
that's the business that
you could never predict.

01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:41.650
It is constantly oscillating.

01:05:41.650 --> 01:05:44.690
It is constantly chaotic.

01:05:44.690 --> 01:05:47.390
So now you ask,
and you say, well,

01:05:47.390 --> 01:05:50.420
that's pretty strange
because it's not actually

01:05:50.420 --> 01:05:51.890
touching the spot.

01:05:51.890 --> 01:05:53.670
But it just keeps
going around it.

01:05:53.670 --> 01:05:57.680
It's clearly pulled to it, but
in a very different sort of way

01:05:57.680 --> 01:06:01.180
than when you get a perturbation
and quickly it does this.

01:06:01.180 --> 01:06:04.670
This is being attracted back
to this pure starting point.

01:06:04.670 --> 01:06:07.200
And here, it never
actually quite gets there.

01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:09.210
But it's sort of
being pulled by it.

01:06:09.210 --> 01:06:10.150
What do we have here?

01:06:10.150 --> 01:06:13.350
We have a strange attractor.

01:06:13.350 --> 01:06:16.310
And that was the terminology
that came into the field.

01:06:16.310 --> 01:06:19.990
A regular old attractor
is one that will pull down

01:06:19.990 --> 01:06:22.410
to a single stable point.

01:06:22.410 --> 01:06:25.860
This is the predictable,
utterly predictable, state

01:06:25.860 --> 01:06:27.770
of the system right now.

01:06:27.770 --> 01:06:32.250
A stranger attractor is one
that has to do with the fact

01:06:32.250 --> 01:06:34.250
that it's going to
oscillate like this.

01:06:34.250 --> 01:06:38.776
But it's never going to settle
down into a single point.

01:06:38.776 --> 01:06:43.380
And suddenly, there's a very
different implication there.

01:06:43.380 --> 01:06:46.310
Because here, when
you're not yet

01:06:46.310 --> 01:06:49.070
at this spot, what's this spot?

01:06:49.070 --> 01:06:50.090
It's noise.

01:06:50.090 --> 01:06:51.420
Its variability.

01:06:51.420 --> 01:06:55.030
And hang on and it's going to go
away because it will eventually

01:06:55.030 --> 01:06:58.410
reach the real answer.

01:06:58.410 --> 01:07:00.830
In systems with
strange attractors,

01:07:00.830 --> 01:07:03.210
what do you make
of the variability?

01:07:03.210 --> 01:07:04.610
It's not noise.

01:07:04.610 --> 01:07:06.980
It is the phenomenon.

01:07:06.980 --> 01:07:10.500
There is no absolute
pure answer in there.

01:07:10.500 --> 01:07:14.670
There is not some idealized,
the real correct answer.

01:07:14.670 --> 01:07:16.620
And you're just
fluxing around here.

01:07:16.620 --> 01:07:19.760
And if only you had better
control of the system,

01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:22.062
you would eventually get
it to look like this.

01:07:22.062 --> 01:07:23.500
This is a myth.

01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:25.430
This is imaginary.

01:07:25.430 --> 01:07:29.390
In complex systems,
there is no answer

01:07:29.390 --> 01:07:32.380
as to what you are
supposed to be observing

01:07:32.380 --> 01:07:35.440
and everything else
is variable noise.

01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:39.085
This is the system itself.

01:07:39.085 --> 01:07:43.400
A critical expansion on that,
so you're looking at this

01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:44.960
and you're saying,
OK, what is this?

01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:47.390
This is measuring
in whatever units

01:07:47.390 --> 01:07:50.630
of time, where the wheel is,
what direction, what speed, all

01:07:50.630 --> 01:07:51.130
of that.

01:07:51.130 --> 01:07:53.400
It's a whole bunch
of data points.

01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:55.860
And the data points would
just keep doing this forever

01:07:55.860 --> 01:07:58.040
and ever, unpredictably.

01:07:58.040 --> 01:07:58.860
Wait a second.

01:07:58.860 --> 01:08:04.181
And you say, at some point
it's got to cross here,

01:08:04.181 --> 01:08:05.480
this spot here.

01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:07.260
And at some point
it's circling around

01:08:07.260 --> 01:08:11.090
and will circle and come
through exactly that point.

01:08:11.090 --> 01:08:16.340
And right now at that point, if
you apply the same equations,

01:08:16.340 --> 01:08:20.399
the same determinist
rules, right at that point,

01:08:20.399 --> 01:08:22.744
the next point should be this.

01:08:22.744 --> 01:08:24.160
And the next point
should be this.

01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:26.109
And what have you just done?

01:08:26.109 --> 01:08:28.430
You're beginning
to repeat yourself.

01:08:28.430 --> 01:08:30.840
You've just had periodicity.

01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:32.970
Wait, this really isn't chaotic.

01:08:32.970 --> 01:08:35.930
As soon as it hits the
same point that was there

01:08:35.930 --> 01:08:38.864
previously, it suddenly
should repeat the pattern

01:08:38.864 --> 01:08:39.810
all over again.

01:08:39.810 --> 01:08:41.090
It's periodic.

01:08:41.090 --> 01:08:42.950
It stopped being
a chaotic system.

01:08:42.950 --> 01:08:43.880
How can this be?

01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:45.870
Because they've got to
touch the same points.

01:08:45.870 --> 01:08:47.060
Look at all that.

01:08:47.060 --> 01:08:49.210
And this was the
next critical concept

01:08:49.210 --> 01:08:53.660
in the field, which is you can
look at this point and maybe

01:08:53.660 --> 01:08:59.859
its coordinates, 6, 3, in a
standard graph or whatever.

01:08:59.859 --> 01:09:01.710
And that's what
the coordinate was

01:09:01.710 --> 01:09:03.160
the first time it was there.

01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:06.710
And now, spinning around, it's
just come there a second time.

01:09:06.710 --> 01:09:08.640
It's back in the same spot.

01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:10.359
Oh, no, it's repeating.

01:09:10.359 --> 01:09:12.600
It isn't chaotic
and unpredictable

01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:14.240
and going on for an infinity.

01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:16.430
And it just fell apart.

01:09:16.430 --> 01:09:18.779
It doesn't really work
this way, until you

01:09:18.779 --> 01:09:21.090
look a little bit closer.

01:09:21.090 --> 01:09:22.990
And you look a
little bit closer.

01:09:22.990 --> 01:09:26.170
And it turns out
this is not 6 and 3.

01:09:26.170 --> 01:09:30.729
This coordinate
was actually 3.7.

01:09:30.729 --> 01:09:32.359
And you look closer here.

01:09:32.359 --> 01:09:36.050
And this one was 3.8.

01:09:36.050 --> 01:09:40.689
In other words, it's not
really in the exact same spot.

01:09:40.689 --> 01:09:44.330
It never gets to the
same exact spot again.

01:09:44.330 --> 01:09:45.330
Where is it then?

01:09:45.330 --> 01:09:46.890
Well, we really measured it now.

01:09:46.890 --> 01:09:49.432
And, in fact, both
of them are 3.7.

01:09:49.432 --> 01:09:50.660
It's the exact same.

01:09:50.660 --> 01:09:54.600
And look a little bit closer,
an order of magnitude closer,

01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:56.370
and there be it.

01:09:56.370 --> 01:09:59.460
And take it out a
million decimal places

01:09:59.460 --> 01:10:02.100
and they still look like
they're in the exact same point,

01:10:02.100 --> 01:10:05.440
a million small places
out in terms of accuracy.

01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:09.440
And a million and one is where
they will differ a little bit.

01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:13.610
And thus, they're
not in the same spot.

01:10:13.610 --> 01:10:19.330
Critical next concept with this,
which is if that's the case

01:10:19.330 --> 01:10:23.490
and there are a million
decimal places out there,

01:10:23.490 --> 01:10:27.590
they are differing by one
decimal place way out there,

01:10:27.590 --> 01:10:31.170
what that means is the
fact that one of them,

01:10:31.170 --> 01:10:35.960
4,000 digits out there,
is 8.2-- and notice,

01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:40.250
an 8.3 and a gazillion
zeroes before that-- that

01:10:40.250 --> 01:10:45.300
means at some point this is
going to function differently

01:10:45.300 --> 01:10:46.891
than this.

01:10:46.891 --> 01:10:51.210
This will produce a
different spot than that.

01:10:51.210 --> 01:10:54.110
They won't go to
the same next place

01:10:54.110 --> 01:10:56.690
because they're actually
different numbers.

01:10:56.690 --> 01:11:00.840
And if a million digits
out, that tiny difference,

01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:05.360
will change the functioning of
that, a million minus 1 digits

01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:07.700
out there, that will
then potentially

01:11:07.700 --> 01:11:10.860
change the functioning of
a million minus 2 digits

01:11:10.860 --> 01:11:12.940
out there, all the way up.

01:11:12.940 --> 01:11:17.410
In other words, the consequences
of this tiny little difference

01:11:17.410 --> 01:11:19.720
gets amplified.

01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:23.250
And this is what's called
the butterfly effect.

01:11:23.250 --> 01:11:25.450
In the standard sort
of jargon in the field,

01:11:25.450 --> 01:11:30.050
the butterfly effect is the fact
that the way a butterfly flaps

01:11:30.050 --> 01:11:36.560
its wings in Korea will change
the weather system in Indiana.

01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:39.140
And this is absolutely the case.

01:11:39.140 --> 01:11:41.370
Because of these
butterfly effects,

01:11:41.370 --> 01:11:45.830
the very local consequences
of something like a butterfly

01:11:45.830 --> 01:11:50.180
flapped its wings versus if
it hadn't flapped its wings,

01:11:50.180 --> 01:11:52.580
would have you just done to
air movement on the planet?

01:11:52.580 --> 01:11:55.010
You are a million
digits out there.

01:11:55.010 --> 01:11:57.750
And you've just changed
that this very last digit

01:11:57.750 --> 01:12:01.660
went from 3 to 4 because the
butterfly flapped its wings.

01:12:01.660 --> 01:12:04.560
And that's going to cause
a difference one digit

01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:06.090
before that, and one digit.

01:12:06.090 --> 01:12:10.150
And these are already
beginning to differ.

01:12:10.150 --> 01:12:13.340
And by the time it gets
up to any level higher,

01:12:13.340 --> 01:12:18.430
it's differing enough that the
next spot will differ as well.

01:12:18.430 --> 01:12:19.540
What are you doing?

01:12:19.540 --> 01:12:22.330
This is why the pattern
can never repeat

01:12:22.330 --> 01:12:24.390
and why it's good
to do this instead.

01:12:24.390 --> 01:12:26.710
Because on some level
of magnification

01:12:26.710 --> 01:12:29.570
in a chaotic system
like this, you never

01:12:29.570 --> 01:12:34.410
have the exact same location,
the exact same coordinates,

01:12:34.410 --> 01:12:36.260
occur a second time.

01:12:36.260 --> 01:12:39.110
Somewhere, however number
of digits out there you

01:12:39.110 --> 01:12:41.790
need to go, the two
of them will differ.

01:12:41.790 --> 01:12:45.570
And that difference can
potentially amplify upward

01:12:45.570 --> 01:12:48.580
in a butterfly effect.

01:12:48.580 --> 01:12:50.960
If you do it that
way, you suddenly

01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:52.520
have a very different view.

01:12:52.520 --> 01:12:56.300
Which is, all the way out, a
gazillion decimal places out

01:12:56.300 --> 01:12:58.832
there, and they
differ like this,

01:12:58.832 --> 01:13:00.600
this isn't noise in the system.

01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:02.370
This isn't variability.

01:13:02.370 --> 01:13:04.630
This is intrinsic to the system.

01:13:04.630 --> 01:13:08.110
And the fact that this
will now expand, amplify

01:13:08.110 --> 01:13:11.260
the consequences, is
why the whole system

01:13:11.260 --> 01:13:14.474
is unpredictable because
of these butterfly effects.

01:13:17.260 --> 01:13:18.020
OK.

01:13:18.020 --> 01:13:21.620
Let me just think about-- oh,
so the critical point here

01:13:21.620 --> 01:13:25.240
is in this strange attractor
realm, not only is there

01:13:25.240 --> 01:13:26.240
no predictability.

01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:27.530
That's an important point.

01:13:27.530 --> 01:13:30.190
And the closer you
look, you will still

01:13:30.190 --> 01:13:32.830
see the same degree
of noise variability.

01:13:32.830 --> 01:13:34.910
Noise is not something
that goes away.

01:13:34.910 --> 01:13:37.810
But almost philosophically,
this critical point

01:13:37.810 --> 01:13:41.220
in a system, a linear boring
system with an attractor,

01:13:41.220 --> 01:13:43.020
this is the answer.

01:13:43.020 --> 01:13:46.360
In chaotic systems,
there's no real answer.

01:13:46.360 --> 01:13:48.420
And if you're out
here, it doesn't

01:13:48.420 --> 01:13:52.326
mean that you're not correct,
you're not quite there.

01:13:52.326 --> 01:13:54.410
There is no there there.

01:13:54.410 --> 01:13:57.810
The notion that there is
a solution at the center

01:13:57.810 --> 01:14:02.600
is a fabrication of the data
oscillating around there.

01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:06.380
There is no correct
idealized answer in there.

01:14:06.380 --> 01:14:09.610
This is the idealized
answer, which

01:14:09.610 --> 01:14:13.640
is a completely
unpredictable system.

01:14:13.640 --> 01:14:14.980
OK.

01:14:14.980 --> 01:14:17.760
What's intrinsic in
this now is the fact

01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:23.110
that even though you now look
an order of magnitude closer,

01:14:23.110 --> 01:14:25.540
there's still this
variability stuff, which

01:14:25.540 --> 01:14:27.420
can amplify, as a
butterfly effect up,

01:14:27.420 --> 01:14:28.750
and make a huge difference.

01:14:28.750 --> 01:14:30.990
And you look an order
of magnitude closer

01:14:30.990 --> 01:14:33.440
and there's still a
butterfly effect potentially.

01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:36.940
And it doesn't matter how
many digits you go down,

01:14:36.940 --> 01:14:42.490
how closely you look, how
good your reductive tools are,

01:14:42.490 --> 01:14:46.370
the variability is still
going to exist down there.

01:14:46.370 --> 01:14:47.840
And the way to
describe this here

01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:52.170
is, thus, this is a
scale-free system.

01:14:52.170 --> 01:14:55.680
The nature of variability
is exactly the same

01:14:55.680 --> 01:14:57.970
if you're looking
at a whole number

01:14:57.970 --> 01:15:00.330
or if you're looking
at a number taken out

01:15:00.330 --> 01:15:04.222
to three decimal places or
three googleplex places,

01:15:04.222 --> 01:15:05.180
and that sort of thing.

01:15:05.180 --> 01:15:08.520
That it's independent of
how many steps down there

01:15:08.520 --> 01:15:10.750
you're examining
the system, the fact

01:15:10.750 --> 01:15:13.040
that there will
still be a difference

01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:15.380
and it can still
butterfly its way up

01:15:15.380 --> 01:15:18.330
to make a difference there,
means that all of this stuff

01:15:18.330 --> 01:15:19.960
is scale-free.

01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:23.910
It doesn't matter how closely
you are looking at it.

01:15:23.910 --> 01:15:27.110
In other words, the whole
reductive philosophy

01:15:27.110 --> 01:15:30.400
of the closer you look,
the better your measurement

01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:34.270
tools, the more variability
is going to go away,

01:15:34.270 --> 01:15:37.540
in a scale-free chaotic
system, regardless

01:15:37.540 --> 01:15:43.810
of what degree of reduction,
of what degree of detail

01:15:43.810 --> 01:15:47.730
you are looking at the system
with, the amount of noise

01:15:47.730 --> 01:15:49.970
is going to proportionally
remain the same

01:15:49.970 --> 01:15:51.380
because it's not noise.

01:15:51.380 --> 01:15:53.040
It is the system.

01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:57.180
So you don't have this reductive
notion that all we need to do

01:15:57.180 --> 01:16:00.550
is get better tools and
look closer and closer

01:16:00.550 --> 01:16:02.630
and noise will go away.

01:16:02.630 --> 01:16:03.940
Because it isn't noise.

01:16:03.940 --> 01:16:07.950
This is the phenomenon
at any scale you look at.

01:16:07.950 --> 01:16:12.460
And this introduces the notion,
thus, of what a fractal is.

01:16:12.460 --> 01:16:16.575
Because a fractal is a complex
pattern, a visual pattern,

01:16:16.575 --> 01:16:20.250
an equation that produces a
pattern, things of that sort,

01:16:20.250 --> 01:16:23.030
where it is scale-free.

01:16:23.030 --> 01:16:26.530
The appearance of it
is the same no matter

01:16:26.530 --> 01:16:28.290
what scale you look at.

01:16:28.290 --> 01:16:31.680
The complexity of it
is the same no matter

01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:33.570
how close you look at it.

01:16:33.570 --> 01:16:37.130
The degree of
variability is the same

01:16:37.130 --> 01:16:38.650
because it's not variability.

01:16:38.650 --> 01:16:40.450
It's intrinsic to the system.

01:16:40.450 --> 01:16:43.540
OK, ways to define a
fractal, because this has

01:16:43.540 --> 01:16:46.267
becomes sort of a very
trendy sort of subject.

01:16:46.267 --> 01:16:47.850
And there's a number
of different ways

01:16:47.850 --> 01:16:49.200
to think about it.

01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:55.530
Most formally, what a
fractal is is information

01:16:55.530 --> 01:16:58.140
that codes for a pattern.

01:16:58.140 --> 01:17:01.670
Where, for example, it can
code for a pattern that

01:17:01.670 --> 01:17:08.420
is a line-- a line-- and thus
is a one-dimensional object.

01:17:08.420 --> 01:17:13.740
But where the line is moving
around with such complexity,

01:17:13.740 --> 01:17:17.100
with such an infinite amount of
complexity, because even if you

01:17:17.100 --> 01:17:20.240
look closer, it's going to be
just as complex, proportionally

01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:21.055
closer and closer.

01:17:21.055 --> 01:17:25.940
In other words, this is going
to be an infinitely long line

01:17:25.940 --> 01:17:28.260
in a finite space.

01:17:28.260 --> 01:17:31.750
Which begins to make it sound
kind of more eventually,

01:17:31.750 --> 01:17:33.650
this is more
beginning to resemble

01:17:33.650 --> 01:17:35.860
a two-dimensional object.

01:17:35.860 --> 01:17:39.680
What a fractal is is some
object, some property, that's

01:17:39.680 --> 01:17:41.980
a fraction of a dimension.

01:17:41.980 --> 01:17:45.080
If this goes on
infinitely, it's a line.

01:17:45.080 --> 01:17:46.710
But it's really much
more than a line.

01:17:46.710 --> 01:17:48.790
But it's not quite
two-dimensional.

01:17:48.790 --> 01:17:51.350
It's 1.3 dimensions.

01:17:51.350 --> 01:17:52.670
It's a fractal.

01:17:52.670 --> 01:17:57.100
A fractal is a system that has
fractional dimensions to it,

01:17:57.100 --> 01:18:00.470
where just the infinite
amount of complexity

01:18:00.470 --> 01:18:03.440
the closer you look, it's
still going to be like this,

01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:06.210
means that this is a
line like no other line.

01:18:06.210 --> 01:18:10.260
It's one that's infinitely
long, packed in a finite space.

01:18:10.260 --> 01:18:11.860
That's more than a line.

01:18:11.860 --> 01:18:13.710
But it's not quite
a two dimensional.

01:18:13.710 --> 01:18:14.820
It's a fraction.

01:18:14.820 --> 01:18:17.160
It's a fraction of a dimension.

01:18:17.160 --> 01:18:21.060
That's the formal mathematical
definition of a fractal.

01:18:21.060 --> 01:18:25.830
For our purposes, it's instead,
as well, no matter how close

01:18:25.830 --> 01:18:29.080
or how far away you look at
it, the amount of variability

01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:30.320
is the same.

01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:34.860
And thus, we have absolutely
a classic fractal system

01:18:34.860 --> 01:18:38.890
if these are canals on Mars
or if these are the dendrites

01:18:38.890 --> 01:18:40.310
of a single neuron.

01:18:40.310 --> 01:18:44.670
No matter what dimension,
with what resolution

01:18:44.670 --> 01:18:47.060
you are looking at
it with, the degree

01:18:47.060 --> 01:18:50.010
of complexity, the
degree of variability,

01:18:50.010 --> 01:18:52.310
remains proportionally constant.

01:18:52.310 --> 01:18:53.530
It's a fractal.

01:18:53.530 --> 01:18:57.130
Bifurcating systems
are classic fractals.

01:18:57.130 --> 01:19:00.050
And the variability
within the system

01:19:00.050 --> 01:19:05.380
is constant regardless of
what scale you are looking at.

01:19:05.380 --> 01:19:08.100
And, thus, is telling
you the variability

01:19:08.100 --> 01:19:10.120
isn't noise variability.

01:19:10.120 --> 01:19:12.962
It's instead, what the
system is actually about.

01:19:16.950 --> 01:19:19.510
So I will look here.

01:19:19.510 --> 01:19:20.950
OK.

01:19:20.950 --> 01:19:23.150
So you see these
fractal properties.

01:19:23.150 --> 01:19:26.230
The circulatory
system is a fractal

01:19:26.230 --> 01:19:28.960
with roughly the same
degree of complexity

01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:32.500
as is the pulmonary system
in its branch points,

01:19:32.500 --> 01:19:35.300
as in the dendrites
of a single neuron,

01:19:35.300 --> 01:19:37.240
as are the branches of a tree.

01:19:37.240 --> 01:19:38.450
They're all fractals.

01:19:38.450 --> 01:19:40.880
Their complexity,
their variability,

01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:42.660
is independent of scale.

01:19:42.660 --> 01:19:45.550
This is what you
begin to see in all

01:19:45.550 --> 01:19:48.720
these physiological
systems, these fractals that

01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:51.140
have equivalent
scales of complexity

01:19:51.140 --> 01:19:54.210
at infinitely different,
vastly different,

01:19:54.210 --> 01:19:56.450
scales of magnification.

01:19:56.450 --> 01:19:59.390
And as a hint of where we're
heading on Friday, what that

01:19:59.390 --> 01:20:02.330
begins to tell you
is you can solve

01:20:02.330 --> 01:20:07.230
this problem of coding for these
vastly bifurcating systems.

01:20:07.230 --> 01:20:09.300
Where this is made
of a billion cells,

01:20:09.300 --> 01:20:11.940
and this is a single
cell, you can use

01:20:11.940 --> 01:20:14.600
some are these similar rules.

01:20:14.600 --> 01:20:17.980
And all the rule has
to be is scale-free.

01:20:17.980 --> 01:20:20.670
We will see exactly what
I mean by that on Friday.

01:20:20.670 --> 01:20:23.470
But this begins to
solve the problem of,

01:20:23.470 --> 01:20:25.340
there's not enough
genes in there.

01:20:25.340 --> 01:20:27.820
And what this
introduces is the notion

01:20:27.820 --> 01:20:32.350
of there being fractal genes,
genes that give instructions

01:20:32.350 --> 01:20:34.605
that are independent of scale.

01:20:34.605 --> 01:20:37.190
And we'll see lots more
about that on Friday.

01:20:37.190 --> 01:20:40.370
So you've got these fractal
systems all over the place,

01:20:40.370 --> 01:20:42.440
where the point over,
and over, and over again

01:20:42.440 --> 01:20:46.520
is the variability
isn't variability noise.

01:20:46.520 --> 01:20:49.130
It is what the
system is all about.

01:20:49.130 --> 01:20:52.650
There is no absolute state,
where the closer you get,

01:20:52.650 --> 01:20:56.150
the more it suddenly is going
to seem clean and nonvariable.

01:20:56.150 --> 01:20:58.800
An example of this,
an example of this

01:20:58.800 --> 01:21:02.584
in the biological literature.

01:21:02.584 --> 01:21:10.230
And this was actually a study
I did about 15 years ago,

01:21:10.230 --> 01:21:13.330
with probably the most obsessive
undergraduate I've met in all

01:21:13.330 --> 01:21:14.740
my years here at Stanford.

01:21:14.740 --> 01:21:17.240
Which was great, because
the study was only doable

01:21:17.240 --> 01:21:20.570
because he was
out-of-his-mind obsessive.

01:21:20.570 --> 01:21:22.540
Here's what the study was about.

01:21:22.540 --> 01:21:27.460
I was thinking about, well, all
of this chaos, fractal stuff,

01:21:27.460 --> 01:21:29.950
amid all of us functioning
with a standard model

01:21:29.950 --> 01:21:32.620
that, God, if only we
could measure this down

01:21:32.620 --> 01:21:34.371
to the single cell
level, then we'd really

01:21:34.371 --> 01:21:36.745
know what's happening, because
that's going to be so much

01:21:36.745 --> 01:21:39.069
better than blood values,
because that's noisy working.

01:21:39.069 --> 01:21:40.610
Working with that
model of the mirror

01:21:40.610 --> 01:21:44.260
reductive you get, the cleaner
the data are going to be.

01:21:44.260 --> 01:21:46.470
And then, here's this
whole other world

01:21:46.470 --> 01:21:48.660
of these non-linear
fractal systems saying,

01:21:48.660 --> 01:21:50.900
it shouldn't work that way.

01:21:50.900 --> 01:21:53.530
So it struck me to do the study.

01:21:53.530 --> 01:21:56.180
And what I wanted
to do was study

01:21:56.180 --> 01:22:00.210
the data generated in
the scientific literature

01:22:00.210 --> 01:22:03.140
at different scales
of reductionism

01:22:03.140 --> 01:22:06.030
and see what happens
to the variability.

01:22:06.030 --> 01:22:08.500
And the point here was to make
it as, like, well controlled

01:22:08.500 --> 01:22:09.565
as possible.

01:22:09.565 --> 01:22:13.742
I felt for some subject, that
was sort of Bio 150 related.

01:22:13.742 --> 01:22:15.450
And came up with the
notion that won't it

01:22:15.450 --> 01:22:19.290
be interesting to look at what
are the effects of testosterone

01:22:19.290 --> 01:22:21.080
on behavior?

01:22:21.080 --> 01:22:24.120
Just taking any such sort of
question out of this course,

01:22:24.120 --> 01:22:25.270
what are the effects?

01:22:25.270 --> 01:22:29.080
And you can answer that
on the level of societies.

01:22:29.080 --> 01:22:30.210
OK.

01:22:30.210 --> 01:22:32.729
People who are
agriculturalists tend

01:22:32.729 --> 01:22:34.270
to have different
testosterone levels

01:22:34.270 --> 01:22:35.510
than hunters, all of that.

01:22:35.510 --> 01:22:38.130
How does that affect
things like behavior?

01:22:38.130 --> 01:22:41.384
You can ask that on the
level of a single individual.

01:22:41.384 --> 01:22:43.050
What does a person's
testosterone levels

01:22:43.050 --> 01:22:44.510
tell you about behavior?

01:22:44.510 --> 01:22:47.610
You can ask on an
organ system level.

01:22:47.610 --> 01:22:49.600
What's happening
to blood pressure

01:22:49.600 --> 01:22:52.210
throughout the body
and cerebral oxygen

01:22:52.210 --> 01:22:54.230
delivery as a
functioning system,

01:22:54.230 --> 01:22:57.454
down to a single organ,
what's happening to the brain,

01:22:57.454 --> 01:22:58.870
down to a single
cell or molecule?

01:22:58.870 --> 01:23:02.070
All the way down, you
see the logic of it.

01:23:02.070 --> 01:23:05.000
So what we did-- and
I use "we" in the,

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:08.810
like, most parasitic way
possible-- what we did

01:23:08.810 --> 01:23:11.842
was to go to the literature,
the scientific literature.

01:23:11.842 --> 01:23:13.800
And for a reason, we
picked the literature, not

01:23:13.800 --> 01:23:16.900
a contemporary one at the time,
but one that was 10 years old.

01:23:16.900 --> 01:23:20.120
And we looked at every
journal out there

01:23:20.120 --> 01:23:21.890
that we could come
up with, that ever

01:23:21.890 --> 01:23:24.170
had papers in the
realm of-- that

01:23:24.170 --> 01:23:26.680
could be interpreted as
the effects of testosterone

01:23:26.680 --> 01:23:27.800
on behavior.

01:23:27.800 --> 01:23:30.150
Up from anthropology
journals, comparisons

01:23:30.150 --> 01:23:32.030
between different
groups; down to people

01:23:32.030 --> 01:23:36.550
doing X-ray crystallography
on testosterone receptors.

01:23:36.550 --> 01:23:38.960
And what this mad
man I had hanging out

01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:42.910
with me at that point did was
go through every single one

01:23:42.910 --> 01:23:44.630
of those papers.

01:23:44.630 --> 01:23:48.440
And first classify it, is
this an organismal one?

01:23:48.440 --> 01:23:50.000
Is this a multiorganismal one?

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.910
Is this a cellular, is this
a subcellular, all of that.

01:23:52.910 --> 01:23:57.800
And then measure how variable
were the data in that study.

01:23:57.800 --> 01:24:00.100
This was a drag.

01:24:00.100 --> 01:24:10.920
Because what he
had to do was-- OK.

01:24:10.920 --> 01:24:13.220
So there would be some figure
in one of these papers,

01:24:13.220 --> 01:24:14.290
looking like this.

01:24:14.290 --> 01:24:18.520
And what this tells you is, for
this group, here's the average.

01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:21.480
And this is a measure of how
much variability there was.

01:24:21.480 --> 01:24:23.210
And this tells you
there was a lot more

01:24:23.210 --> 01:24:25.794
variability in this measure
than this one, all of that.

01:24:25.794 --> 01:24:27.210
You could come up
with something--

01:24:27.210 --> 01:24:29.280
and do not worry about
the details here--

01:24:29.280 --> 01:24:32.170
something called a
coefficient of variation.

01:24:32.170 --> 01:24:36.330
Which is, you ask how
much variability is there

01:24:36.330 --> 01:24:39.050
relative to the
total size of this?

01:24:39.050 --> 01:24:43.550
And thus, what you will get
is, say, a circumstance,

01:24:43.550 --> 01:24:47.070
if this is 100 units
high; and in this case,

01:24:47.070 --> 01:24:48.920
this is 10 units high;
and in this case,

01:24:48.920 --> 01:24:50.560
this is 50 units high.

01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:54.670
In this case, your coefficient
of variation would be 50%.

01:24:54.670 --> 01:24:59.510
Your variance is half the size
of the thing you're studying.

01:24:59.510 --> 01:25:01.750
And in this case, the
coefficient of variation

01:25:01.750 --> 01:25:03.270
would only be 10%.

01:25:03.270 --> 01:25:05.860
It's much less noisy data.

01:25:05.860 --> 01:25:09.110
So what he did with
his little ruler

01:25:09.110 --> 01:25:12.080
there, in the next 3 and 1/2
years, with nothing else to do,

01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:14.520
he went through these
hundreds of papers.

01:25:14.520 --> 01:25:18.300
And for every single figure,
he measured what was the mean

01:25:18.300 --> 01:25:20.680
and what was the error bar
in every single figure.

01:25:20.680 --> 01:25:22.150
And, thus, what
was the coefficient

01:25:22.150 --> 01:25:26.800
of variation for that
piece of inflow of data,

01:25:26.800 --> 01:25:29.240
for that figure, for
that entire paper,

01:25:29.240 --> 01:25:31.660
that would have eleventy
different bars of data

01:25:31.660 --> 01:25:32.160
in there?

01:25:32.160 --> 01:25:34.520
And he's measuring away
and going mad from this.

01:25:34.520 --> 01:25:36.590
And eventually, what
he could then do

01:25:36.590 --> 01:25:40.390
was stick in the average
coefficient of variation

01:25:40.390 --> 01:25:44.210
in all of the papers in
the organismal category,

01:25:44.210 --> 01:25:46.795
and all the papers in
the cellular category,

01:25:46.795 --> 01:25:48.740
and all the way down.

01:25:48.740 --> 01:25:52.020
Reductive science,
what's the prediction?

01:25:52.020 --> 01:25:55.440
As we go from the big
organismal papers,

01:25:55.440 --> 01:25:59.410
all the way down to the
subcellular, submolecular ones,

01:25:59.410 --> 01:26:04.280
the noise, the variability,
the coefficient of variation

01:26:04.280 --> 01:26:08.570
should be decreasing as
you get more reductive.

01:26:08.570 --> 01:26:11.090
That would be the
traditional interpretation.

01:26:11.090 --> 01:26:14.200
The chaotic fractal
interpretation would be,

01:26:14.200 --> 01:26:15.580
it's not noise.

01:26:15.580 --> 01:26:18.860
It's not noise that you want to
get rid of with better tools.

01:26:18.860 --> 01:26:22.620
It is intrinsic--
I'm going to leave it

01:26:22.620 --> 01:26:26.210
there-- oscillatory stuff,
which is the system, rather

01:26:26.210 --> 01:26:28.290
than the discrepancy
from the system.

01:26:28.290 --> 01:26:31.550
It would predict that the
relative amount of noise,

01:26:31.550 --> 01:26:33.890
the variability, the
coefficient of variation,

01:26:33.890 --> 01:26:36.954
shouldn't be trending
towards decreasing.

01:26:36.954 --> 01:26:38.620
There shouldn't really
be a relationship

01:26:38.620 --> 01:26:42.160
between what level you
are examining phenomenon

01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:43.680
and the amount of variability.

01:26:43.680 --> 01:26:46.630
So an insane amount
of work later,

01:26:46.630 --> 01:26:50.530
this was his, like, what he
spent the early 1990s on,

01:26:50.530 --> 01:26:53.034
producing this one figure here.

01:26:53.034 --> 01:26:53.930
[LAUGHTER]

01:26:53.930 --> 01:26:54.880
This was it.

01:26:54.880 --> 01:26:55.480
This was it.

01:26:55.480 --> 01:26:59.620
He wept with pride and happiness
when we finally saw this,

01:26:59.620 --> 01:27:01.950
going from, this
is the coefficient

01:27:01.950 --> 01:27:05.490
of variation on all the data
in all the papers that year

01:27:05.490 --> 01:27:07.440
that were at the
organismal level,

01:27:07.440 --> 01:27:10.410
about an 18% coefficient
of variation.

01:27:10.410 --> 01:27:14.060
Organ system, single organ,
multicellular, single cell,

01:27:14.060 --> 01:27:18.420
subcellular, is there a trend
towards variability decreasing?

01:27:18.420 --> 01:27:19.700
Absolutely not.

01:27:19.700 --> 01:27:21.310
It's not going anywhere.

01:27:21.310 --> 01:27:23.220
It's remaining fairly constant.

01:27:23.220 --> 01:27:26.430
Looking over scales of
magnifications ranging

01:27:26.430 --> 01:27:29.530
from societies, down
to crystallography

01:27:29.530 --> 01:27:33.190
on single molecules, the
data don't get cleaner.

01:27:33.190 --> 01:27:34.930
They don't get less variable.

01:27:34.930 --> 01:27:37.730
Because it's a fractal system.

01:27:37.730 --> 01:27:40.370
One additional
possibility there was

01:27:40.370 --> 01:27:43.345
that part of what was
going in was you're

01:27:43.345 --> 01:27:46.674
looking at the entire
literature in that year.

01:27:46.674 --> 01:27:48.340
And as we all know,
some of those papers

01:27:48.340 --> 01:27:50.950
are going to be kind of garbage
and not very good science.

01:27:50.950 --> 01:27:52.740
Maybe that's the
noise in the system.

01:27:52.740 --> 01:27:55.400
And there's enough noise that
it swamps every single one

01:27:55.400 --> 01:27:56.280
of these levels.

01:27:56.280 --> 01:27:59.100
Here was the advantage that
we had been looking at papers

01:27:59.100 --> 01:28:00.880
published 10 years before.

01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:05.090
You could now see how many
times that paper was cited

01:28:05.090 --> 01:28:06.525
in the subsequent 10 years.

01:28:06.525 --> 01:28:08.670
In other words, you
could find the papers

01:28:08.670 --> 01:28:11.470
that were considered
by people in that field

01:28:11.470 --> 01:28:15.000
to be the really good ones,
versus the ones that were junk.

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:18.450
Now if we do the whole analysis
only on the papers that

01:28:18.450 --> 01:28:21.340
were in the top 10
percentile of influence,

01:28:21.340 --> 01:28:24.710
the best papers in the
field, and it winds up

01:28:24.710 --> 01:28:26.750
looking exactly like this.

01:28:26.750 --> 01:28:28.580
It's a fractal system.

01:28:28.580 --> 01:28:31.420
As you get closer and
closer to measuring

01:28:31.420 --> 01:28:33.700
what's really
happening, wow, down

01:28:33.700 --> 01:28:35.410
to the level of
single molecules,

01:28:35.410 --> 01:28:39.900
you don't get any cleaner data
because it's a fractal system.

01:28:39.900 --> 01:28:42.540
It's a chaotic fractal system.

01:28:42.540 --> 01:28:44.220
So that was real interesting.

01:28:44.220 --> 01:28:45.730
What was even more
interesting was

01:28:45.730 --> 01:28:48.730
after that, when we tried
to publish the paper.

01:28:48.730 --> 01:28:51.560
So got it together and
we wrote up this paper.

01:28:51.560 --> 01:28:55.370
And we sent it off to, like,
one of my favorite neuroscience

01:28:55.370 --> 01:28:56.100
journals.

01:28:56.100 --> 01:28:57.820
And after a couple
of weeks, the editor

01:28:57.820 --> 01:29:00.460
wrote back, saying this
is totally cool stuff.

01:29:00.460 --> 01:29:01.590
This is really interesting.

01:29:01.590 --> 01:29:03.540
This has really made
me rethink some stuff.

01:29:03.540 --> 01:29:05.321
This is very stimulating stuff.

01:29:05.321 --> 01:29:07.570
I don't see what it has to
do with our journal though.

01:29:07.570 --> 01:29:09.472
So we really can't publish it.

01:29:09.472 --> 01:29:11.930
So then I sent it off to my
favorite endocrinology journal.

01:29:11.930 --> 01:29:13.596
And two weeks later,
back comes a letter

01:29:13.596 --> 01:29:16.050
from the editor, saying,
whoa, totally cool stuff.

01:29:16.050 --> 01:29:18.549
Come over for dinner and bring
that piece of paper with you.

01:29:18.549 --> 01:29:21.000
But I don't quite see what
it has to do with our field.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:22.830
And marching our
way up and down,

01:29:22.830 --> 01:29:24.640
all the different
relevant journals

01:29:24.640 --> 01:29:26.880
in those different
disciplines, and each time

01:29:26.880 --> 01:29:29.260
they come back saying, whoa,
isn't that interesting.

01:29:29.260 --> 01:29:30.718
I can't wait to
tell my friend, who

01:29:30.718 --> 01:29:33.550
is the social anthropologist
or the x-ray crystallographer.

01:29:33.550 --> 01:29:36.960
But I don't see what it has to
do with our particular field

01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:37.530
here.

01:29:37.530 --> 01:29:40.240
And we couldn't get it
published in a journal that

01:29:40.240 --> 01:29:43.390
specialized in any single
one of these levels.

01:29:43.390 --> 01:29:45.690
So ultimately, we
published in this journal,

01:29:45.690 --> 01:29:49.000
this sort of philosophical
proceedings of medicine

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:49.640
and biology.

01:29:49.640 --> 01:29:53.120
As far as I can tell, I was
the first person under age 80

01:29:53.120 --> 01:29:54.971
to ever publish a
paper in that journal.

01:29:54.971 --> 01:29:55.470
[LAUGHTER]

01:29:55.470 --> 01:29:58.910
It's the journal of
somewhat demented, senile,

01:29:58.910 --> 01:30:01.110
elderly emeritus
professors, who were now

01:30:01.110 --> 01:30:03.730
writing their philosophical
pieces because they're not

01:30:03.730 --> 01:30:05.700
generating data any more.

01:30:05.700 --> 01:30:08.460
I broke the age barrier
on that journal.

01:30:08.460 --> 01:30:09.760
And they published in there.

01:30:09.760 --> 01:30:11.880
And in the years
since, it has had,

01:30:11.880 --> 01:30:15.870
like, zero impact on the
literature in terms of anybody

01:30:15.870 --> 01:30:18.340
quoting it, in terms
of anybody citing it.

01:30:18.340 --> 01:30:20.200
Actually that's not true.

01:30:20.200 --> 01:30:22.850
There's this
mathematician in Moscow.

01:30:22.850 --> 01:30:25.070
This guy started writing
to me about two months

01:30:25.070 --> 01:30:26.510
after the paper came out.

01:30:26.510 --> 01:30:29.610
And he basically said, this
was the most wonderful thing

01:30:29.610 --> 01:30:30.340
he had ever read.

01:30:30.340 --> 01:30:33.250
And I had transformed his
life, and he loved me.

01:30:33.250 --> 01:30:36.250
And he's been writing about
once every three weeks since.

01:30:36.250 --> 01:30:37.530
His English is not very good.

01:30:37.530 --> 01:30:40.620
Either he wants to adopt me
or he wants me to adopt him.

01:30:40.620 --> 01:30:41.890
I'm not quite sure in that.

01:30:41.890 --> 01:30:42.390
[LAUGHTER]

01:30:42.390 --> 01:30:45.220
But as far as saying,
that's like the only person

01:30:45.220 --> 01:30:47.490
who noticed that
it there, showing

01:30:47.490 --> 01:30:50.380
this point that this
is, but what does it

01:30:50.380 --> 01:30:52.100
have to do with our discipline?

01:30:52.100 --> 01:30:57.290
So what we see here is a prelude
to Friday, what fractals do

01:30:57.290 --> 01:31:00.230
is blow apart the notion
that get even more

01:31:00.230 --> 01:31:02.990
reductive than they
were back in the 1500s

01:31:02.990 --> 01:31:04.430
and we'll get better data.

01:31:04.430 --> 01:31:06.130
It doesn't get
better because it's

01:31:06.130 --> 01:31:07.940
the same degree of variability.

01:31:07.940 --> 01:31:13.820
Because the variability is
the-- whoa, where did that go?

01:31:13.820 --> 01:31:16.920
The variability is the
system, rather than

01:31:16.920 --> 01:31:18.880
discrepancy from the system.

01:31:18.880 --> 01:31:20.750
Fractals show that as well.

01:31:20.750 --> 01:31:22.650
What we'll begin
to see on Friday

01:31:22.650 --> 01:31:26.390
is how you can now
use fractal systems

01:31:26.390 --> 01:31:30.030
to solve some of those problems
of not enough neurons, not

01:31:30.030 --> 01:31:31.270
enough genes.

01:31:31.270 --> 01:31:32.060
OK.

01:31:32.060 --> 01:31:35.090
So on first past, what did
today seem to be about?

01:31:35.090 --> 01:31:38.200
This endless
trashing of reductive

01:31:38.200 --> 01:31:42.650
science and, you know, that's
how you fix a broken clock.

01:31:42.650 --> 01:31:44.600
But the world of really
interesting things

01:31:44.600 --> 01:31:48.690
are like broken clouds and are
non-linear aperiodic systems,

01:31:48.690 --> 01:31:51.190
that are just as interesting
and just as complex,

01:31:51.190 --> 01:31:53.000
no matter what scale
you look at them at.

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.940
Hooray, most of science
makes no sense whatsoever.

01:31:55.940 --> 01:31:58.590
Hooray for us, we
are the vanguard.

01:31:58.590 --> 01:31:59.240
OK.

01:31:59.240 --> 01:32:00.000
That's a drag.

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.330
Because that really doesn't
accomplish a whole lot

01:32:02.330 --> 01:32:05.650
because what there has
to be is a substitution.

01:32:05.650 --> 01:32:08.890
So where is the
actual predictability?

01:32:08.890 --> 01:32:11.230
Where is the actual
insight coming from?

01:32:11.230 --> 01:32:12.910
And that's what
Friday is about, which

01:32:12.910 --> 01:32:15.976
is this whole field of
complexity, emergence,

01:32:15.976 --> 01:32:17.630
what we'll look at there.

01:32:17.630 --> 01:32:20.907
But the last point here winds
up being, OK, OK, terrific.

01:32:20.907 --> 01:32:21.740
You've convinced me.

01:32:21.740 --> 01:32:25.790
You have trashed linear
additive periodic systems.

01:32:25.790 --> 01:32:28.190
And 500 years' worth
of books of science

01:32:28.190 --> 01:32:29.920
need to be burned at the stake.

01:32:29.920 --> 01:32:33.351
Is classical reductionism
good for anything?

01:32:33.351 --> 01:32:33.850
Yes.

01:32:33.850 --> 01:32:34.790
We already know it is.

01:32:34.790 --> 01:32:36.080
It's good for when
clocks are broken.

01:32:36.080 --> 01:32:36.740
No, no, no.

01:32:36.740 --> 01:32:39.760
I mean is it good for
anything in the realm of stuff

01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:43.740
that we're interested in,
in how, like, biology works,

01:32:43.740 --> 01:32:46.310
in how behavior
works, any of that?

01:32:46.310 --> 01:32:50.740
And what you get is, it's very
useful and very effective,

01:32:50.740 --> 01:32:55.070
if you're not very picky,
if you are not very precise.

01:32:55.070 --> 01:32:56.300
An example.

01:32:56.300 --> 01:32:58.260
There's a miserable
disease out there,

01:32:58.260 --> 01:33:00.530
that's wiping out
people left and right.

01:33:00.530 --> 01:33:02.800
And it's this viral disease.

01:33:02.800 --> 01:33:04.750
And you're trying to
figure out how to come up

01:33:04.750 --> 01:33:05.990
with a vaccine for it.

01:33:05.990 --> 01:33:08.070
And you finally come
up with a vaccine.

01:33:08.070 --> 01:33:10.010
And you start
distributing it to people.

01:33:10.010 --> 01:33:12.730
And what you see is exactly
what Jonas Salk saw,

01:33:12.730 --> 01:33:15.690
was that it did wonders
for preventing polio.

01:33:15.690 --> 01:33:20.100
But one in 560
kids, instead would

01:33:20.100 --> 01:33:22.740
get a worst case of polio.

01:33:22.740 --> 01:33:27.480
So you could now ask a
very reductive question,

01:33:27.480 --> 01:33:33.360
which is, is this vaccine,
what happened in that one kid?

01:33:33.360 --> 01:33:35.850
And what we'll see
at that level is

01:33:35.850 --> 01:33:38.560
if you're trying to ask
that, that's not going to be.

01:33:38.560 --> 01:33:40.584
If we understand what
happened in that one kid,

01:33:40.584 --> 01:33:43.000
we're going have to understand
their individual cells, all

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:44.958
the way down, to get
better and better numbers.

01:33:44.958 --> 01:33:46.860
Because this OK, we've
just entered the world

01:33:46.860 --> 01:33:49.430
where it's actually a
nonlinear chaotic system.

01:33:49.430 --> 01:33:52.690
Where's the reductionism useful?

01:33:52.690 --> 01:33:55.260
On the average, it's
a whole lot better

01:33:55.260 --> 01:33:59.070
that kids got this vaccine than
they didn't get the vaccine.

01:33:59.070 --> 01:34:03.240
You want reductive classical
dead-right male reproductive

01:34:03.240 --> 01:34:04.640
predictable science.

01:34:04.640 --> 01:34:06.775
It's if you have a
community of kids,

01:34:06.775 --> 01:34:09.570
who get injected with this,
versus a community that

01:34:09.570 --> 01:34:12.310
doesn't, they're
going to be healthier.

01:34:12.310 --> 01:34:14.660
Don't ask me about one
particular individual, let

01:34:14.660 --> 01:34:17.000
alone one particular
individual's immune system.

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:18.920
The reductionism
breaks down there.

01:34:18.920 --> 01:34:24.050
But if fancy, satisfying
science for you counts as,

01:34:24.050 --> 01:34:28.570
do they tend to be healthier
than them, reduction is great.

01:34:28.570 --> 01:34:30.540
That is sufficient.

01:34:30.540 --> 01:34:33.024
Suppose your question
is, well, is there

01:34:33.024 --> 01:34:34.440
a certain time of
the year, what's

01:34:34.440 --> 01:34:37.550
the weather likely going to
be in January versus in June?

01:34:37.550 --> 01:34:40.020
You're never going to
have reductive tools that

01:34:40.020 --> 01:34:43.300
can tell you on any particular
day what the temperature is

01:34:43.300 --> 01:34:45.670
going to be three
years from now.

01:34:45.670 --> 01:34:49.680
But if all you want to know is,
in general, it's warmer in June

01:34:49.680 --> 01:34:54.240
than in January, reductive tools
that exist now are sufficient.

01:34:54.240 --> 01:34:56.880
And when you look at what
people do in their research,

01:34:56.880 --> 01:34:59.880
in the labs and places
like this, in my lab,

01:34:59.880 --> 01:35:02.454
all of that, when you sit
there and you say, whoa,

01:35:02.454 --> 01:35:04.120
we just learned and
are trying to, like,

01:35:04.120 --> 01:35:06.070
figure out the cure
of some disease

01:35:06.070 --> 01:35:08.630
by finding the
mutation, whoa, that's

01:35:08.630 --> 01:35:09.930
really a reductive approach.

01:35:09.930 --> 01:35:11.795
And we just learned
that's gibberish.

01:35:11.795 --> 01:35:13.840
Whoa, everybody toss
out what they do.

01:35:13.840 --> 01:35:16.480
It's actually quite
useful because you're not

01:35:16.480 --> 01:35:18.940
very picky about what
you want out of it.

01:35:18.940 --> 01:35:20.730
My lab, for example,
studies what

01:35:20.730 --> 01:35:23.630
happens in brains after
there's a stroke and trying

01:35:23.630 --> 01:35:26.230
to figure out gene therapy
stuff that you can do.

01:35:26.230 --> 01:35:30.560
And we can't tell you
why one rat out of eight

01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:33.170
is not going to be
helped by this procedure.

01:35:33.170 --> 01:35:36.410
Whereas, three rats are
wonderful, and so on.

01:35:36.410 --> 01:35:36.950
Oh, I know.

01:35:36.950 --> 01:35:38.550
Let's look at their
are single molecules.

01:35:38.550 --> 01:35:39.633
That's not going to do it.

01:35:39.633 --> 01:35:40.940
Reductionism breaks apart.

01:35:40.940 --> 01:35:44.080
But it's perfectly fine at
the level that's useful here,

01:35:44.080 --> 01:35:46.629
which is, on the average,
is this something

01:35:46.629 --> 01:35:48.920
plausibly that you might want
to do to humans somewhere

01:35:48.920 --> 01:35:50.070
down the line?

01:35:50.070 --> 01:35:52.832
Most of what the science
research is about--

01:35:52.832 --> 01:35:54.540
and when you look at
the labs around here

01:35:54.540 --> 01:35:55.920
and you look at
the labs you work

01:35:55.920 --> 01:35:58.500
in, if those of you, who are
lots of you, do research,

01:35:58.500 --> 01:36:01.340
it's reductionism is
a perfectly good thing

01:36:01.340 --> 01:36:05.420
to use because you're not being
too picky what-- you do not

01:36:05.420 --> 01:36:07.640
want to come up with
an explanation for how

01:36:07.640 --> 01:36:12.070
every neuron in every
developing grasshopper on Earth

01:36:12.070 --> 01:36:12.790
bifurcates.

01:36:12.790 --> 01:36:15.380
At this point, you want to
know, in general, somewhere

01:36:15.380 --> 01:36:19.080
around hours three
to four after the egg

01:36:19.080 --> 01:36:22.390
starts or the grasshopper
parents meet and fall in love,

01:36:22.390 --> 01:36:25.230
or whatever it is,
that, in general, that's

01:36:25.230 --> 01:36:28.100
when you begin to get
differentiation here.

01:36:28.100 --> 01:36:29.600
Your science is great.

01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:31.930
So as long as most
of what we're asking

01:36:31.930 --> 01:36:34.770
is this sort of science,
where you just kind

01:36:34.770 --> 01:36:37.270
of a need to have a
general predictive sense,

01:36:37.270 --> 01:36:39.510
reductionism is just fine.

01:36:39.510 --> 01:36:42.600
But nonetheless, underneath
all of it, when you really

01:36:42.600 --> 01:36:46.820
want to understand the systems,
it's anything but reductionism.

01:36:46.820 --> 01:36:49.660
And probably the most
important philosophical point

01:36:49.660 --> 01:36:53.640
is when you look at these
interesting complex systems,

01:36:53.640 --> 01:36:56.420
there is not a "the answer."

01:36:56.420 --> 01:37:00.800
There is not a "the solution" to
what is this water wheel going

01:37:00.800 --> 01:37:01.770
to be doing?

01:37:01.770 --> 01:37:05.550
And thus, all of us, who
are out there, not quite

01:37:05.550 --> 01:37:07.700
matching the perfect
one, it is not

01:37:07.700 --> 01:37:11.960
that we are being deviating
from what the real answer, what

01:37:11.960 --> 01:37:14.230
the real norm is supposed to be.

01:37:14.230 --> 01:37:17.360
The variation is what
it's supposed to be.

01:37:17.360 --> 01:37:19.170
All of the things
that are interesting,

01:37:19.170 --> 01:37:21.700
when you measure them,
and they look like this,

01:37:21.700 --> 01:37:24.720
it's not because they
are failing to be what

01:37:24.720 --> 01:37:28.360
they're supposed to be and
match the norm, they're--

01:37:28.360 --> 01:37:31.760
