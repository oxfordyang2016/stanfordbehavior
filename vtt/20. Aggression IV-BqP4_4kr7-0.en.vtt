[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:05.930
Stanford University.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.423
OK, let's get started.

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.790
We pick up with aggression,
competition, et cetera.

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:25.390
And where have we gotten to?

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.130
We are now just about
to leap to, instead

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.100
of early environment,
early hormonal exposure,

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:37.240
parenatal-- hormones both
pre, before and after birth.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.300
Around that time,
what do they have

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.120
to do with adult
behavior in these realms?

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.170
So, again, this is tapping into
that same concept from the sex

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.840
lectures-- organizational
hormonal effects,

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.100
versus activational.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.250
Organizational early in life,
setting up the nervous system

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.330
to respond later on to some
sort of activational hormonal

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:01.890
effect.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.744
So the basic theme that's come
through with animal studies

00:01:04.744 --> 00:01:07.100
here has been built
around, what if you

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.600
have females who are prenatally,
or perinatally, androgenized,

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.270
exposed to high
testosterone levels?

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.130
And what you see is,
basically, the exact same thing

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.210
as from the sex
lectures, which is

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.190
you get a powerful
masculinization--

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:28.870
organizational masculinization
effect so that later on these

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.340
are females who respond
to even their low levels

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.090
of testosterone
in the bloodstream

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.360
with increased
levels of aggression,

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.270
more aggressive play, bunch
of measures like that,

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.820
less maternal behavior when
having offspring-- a pretty

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.370
clear literature in terms
of prenatal masculinization

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:52.110
of aggressive behavior, as
well as sexual behavior.

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.390
So, as usual, what about humans?

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.690
And we go back to
our two diseases

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.550
from the other week one was that
congenital adrenal hyperplasia

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.580
business, that tumor in
the mother that produces

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.140
vast amounts of,
among other things,

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.310
an androgen, a
testosterone derivative,

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.730
which androgenizes the fetus.

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.070
Or the case with that drug
DES, diethylstilbestrol,

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.790
where some women in
the '50s took them

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.470
for preventing
miscarriage, in some cases

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:22.920
had androgenic effect.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.260
Back to the same
issue as with the sex

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.510
lectures, so what's the behavior
of these individuals like?

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.480
And, again, people
were over that one.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.200
People were really
interested in this.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.030
Both of them kind of
burst on the scene,

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.840
congenital adrenal hyperplasia,
and the DES babies,

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.620
around the same time
lots of people started

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.230
studying these kids as they
started growing up with a very

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.840
simple question
here of, are they

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.770
going to be more aggressive
than typical girls?

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.214
And, ultimately, will they
be more aggressive women?

00:02:56.214 --> 00:02:57.880
And somewhere between
the lines, they're

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.770
also asking the
question, are they

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.950
going to be more aggressive than
is normal for a typical girl?

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.500
So what began to come
out of these studies?

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.420
First off, some interesting,
odd, quirky things-- one

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.430
is when you androgenize
a female fetus

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.790
human, later on as
a child she will

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.754
have a higher than average IQ.

00:03:22.754 --> 00:03:25.770
Whoa, that's kind
of interesting.

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:29.080
Stay tuned, it turns out
that's not at all interesting.

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.150
OK, so that was observed.

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.150
Another thing,
more of a tendency

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.190
towards being left-handed,
better spatial skills.

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.370
And both of those
are attributes that

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.150
are more common among
males than females.

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.870
What else?

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.910
That's all that
sort of stuff having

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.330
to do with ancillary issues.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.970
But now, finally, people
were then really focusing

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:53.910
in on the issues of aggression.

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.170
And by the time these
girls were, I don't know,

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:01.280
10, 12 years old or so, the
findings were absolutely clear.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:07.090
These kids were way, way
more aggressive than normal.

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:08.800
How do you know?

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.280
Because they were less
interested in playing

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.820
with dolls than normal
girls, because they expressed

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.510
less interest in
marriage, because they

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.910
expressed more interest in
having a career some day.

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:26.250
So these were, obviously, over
the top, rabid, psychopathic,

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.050
androgenized, females
because they weren't normal.

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.120
They weren't interested
in dolls, or marriage,

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.530
and were interested in a career.

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:37.250
This was in every textbook
starting in the late '60s,

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.400
and was still there in
textbooks by the mid '80s or so,

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.000
endocrinology textbooks.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.280
And somewhere in the
early '70s or so,

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.000
probably some male
endocrinologists kind of

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.730
discovered that,
you know, wanting

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:54.930
a career if you're female
does not count as aggression.

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.810
Actually, they came up with an
even better term-- assertive

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.050
dominance.

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.480
How's that for a term that just
summarizes an entire worldview

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.240
of gender differences?

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.730
OK, so some male endocrinologist
finally figured that out.

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:09.290
Or maybe actually
they're finally

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:11.680
started being some female
endocrinologists who

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.250
pointed out this was gibberish.

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:16.060
The entire literature
went down the tubes,

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.240
had to be started all over.

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.870
Oh, wanting a career is not
being assertively, dominantly

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.290
aggressive if you're female.

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:27.730
So back to stage one on that
whole literature, lots of work

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:28.560
since then.

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.130
What the literature
has generally shown

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:34.910
is the left-handedness is there.

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:36.650
The spatial issue
seem to remain.

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.420
The higher IQ is there.

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:43.290
What's up with that?

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:45.790
All that's known is
as an explanation,

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:49.890
you find an equivalently
higher IQ in the parents.

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:52.460
So it's got nothing to do
with the androgenization.

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:56.550
There's some sort of
selection going on, perhaps

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:00.370
who winds up being in a study
like this-- sort of more

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:01.460
educated families.

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:02.440
Who knows what.

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.190
But that one turned out
to be a red herring.

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:06.570
What about aggression?

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:08.750
Because now there's
been populations

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:12.430
of androgenized girls who
are now well into adulthood.

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:14.160
What about antisocial behavior?

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.080
What about all those
sorts of things?

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:20.280
And, in general, what is shown
is there's not much going on.

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:23.480
The literature has
been pretty ambiguous

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:27.490
in terms of any sort of trends
there of different behaviors,

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:31.230
different attitudes, different
motivations, et cetera,

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:34.490
in these folks as they grow up.

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:39.310
But suppose what you
found was, as adults,

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:42.640
women who had been androgenized
as fetuses were now

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:47.260
17 times more likely to
start brawls in bar rooms,

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.760
to snipe at people
from the tops of water

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:52.310
towers, things of that sort.

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:53.652
What would you conclude?

00:06:53.652 --> 00:06:56.700
Oh, prenatal testosterone
makes you more

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:59.900
aggressive as an adult-- no.

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:02.820
Same confound with these
folks as from the sex

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:07.020
lectures the other week, which
is these girls were not just

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:10.570
born having been exposed to
lots of testosterone in utero,

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:13.020
and doing something or
other to their brain.

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:17.520
They were born with, basically,
a hermaphroditic profile

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:21.390
of genitals that looked
like males, or intersects,

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:23.700
sexually ambiguous genitals.

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:26.320
These were the kids who
went through a dozen rounds

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:30.070
of reconstructive surgery in
their first half dozen years

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:33.810
of life, their first 10 years of
life, in this part of the body

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:36.890
that everyone is interested in,
but doesn't quite talk about.

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:38.070
And what's up with that?

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:39.460
Why aren't I normal?

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:42.580
And these, once
again, were not girls

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:44.960
who grew up with the only
thing being different

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:48.050
about them their prenatal
hormone exposure.

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:52.070
Basically makes the whole
literature uninterpretable.

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:54.850
So what else in terms of
prenatal hormone effects?

00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:56.580
Another literature
that people have

00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:59.420
looked at, which in
principle could be extremely

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:03.460
informative, looking
at dizygotic twins,

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:05.190
non-identical twins.

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:06.580
So you were a girl.

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:08.550
You're a dizygotic twin.

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:11.080
And you could have a
sibling who is either

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:14.000
a sister or a brother.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.270
In other words, you may have
spent your time in utero

00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:20.800
with your sibling who
either did or did not

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:24.070
secrete a certain amount of
testosterone during that time.

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:26.600
Do you see any sort
of masculinization

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:30.100
of aspects of
aggressive behavior

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:34.710
in girls who are dizygotic
twins with a male sibling

00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:36.929
rather than a female one?

00:08:36.929 --> 00:08:40.929
And what you wind up
seeing is these kids show,

00:08:40.929 --> 00:08:44.370
on the average, more
aggressive play in childhood,

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:46.850
more-- here's the
jargony term-- more rough

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:51.420
and tumble play, more interest
in cars, mechanical things

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:55.420
like that, less interest in
stuffed animals, in dolls--

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:57.410
small effect, very small effect.

00:08:57.410 --> 00:09:01.030
Nonetheless, it suggests that
this is another realm where

00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:04.120
a little bit of prenatal
exposure to testosterone

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:07.590
will change the
behavioral profile.

00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:10.980
Except there's a confound
in these studies, which

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:15.100
is if you were a girl and you
have an identical twin who

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:19.890
is a boy, you are in the
Guinness Book of Records.

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:21.470
OK, let's start that one.

00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:25.160
If you are a girl and you
have a non-identical twin--

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:26.302
that's how it works, OK.

00:09:26.302 --> 00:09:28.510
I knew I should have checked
the notes before coming.

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:31.880
So you've got a non-identical
twin who is a boy.

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:35.390
Not only do you spend
your prenatal environment

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:37.870
being awash in some of
his dribbling hormones,

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:39.940
but you grow up with him.

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:44.850
And girls who grow up
with boys as brothers-- as

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:47.045
opposed to plants as brothers.

00:09:47.045 --> 00:09:48.930
Whoa, what is happening here?

00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:53.270
OK, being a girl growing up
with brother brothers increases

00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:56.940
the likelihood of rough and
tumble play, because that's

00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:59.670
what you do with your
brother-- once again,

00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:01.670
uninterpretable literature.

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:05.680
Generally, what you
see is very, very clear

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:10.060
cut androgenization of
aggressive behavior prenatal

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:13.000
testosterone when you're
looking at rodents.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.880
By the time you're looking at
primates, some pretty strong

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:18.540
patterns but nowhere near
as dramatic as in rodent

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:19.750
species looked at.

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:23.440
By the time you look at
humans, maybe just some hints,

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:25.310
but that at the most.

00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:27.520
Of the most interesting
realms, literatures,

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:30.580
where people have been thinking
about prenatal testosterone

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:33.770
exposure is work
of a guy in the UK

00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:36.150
at Oxford named
Simon Baron-Cohen.

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:40.580
And what he is, is basically
the world's expert on autism.

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:44.190
And he has developed what
is called the hyper male

00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:46.790
hypothesis of autism.

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:50.860
For starters, there's a
very, very big gender skew

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:54.950
in autism-- far more frequent
among boys than girls,

00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:56.820
among males than females.

00:10:56.820 --> 00:11:00.760
And what Baron-Cohen has done
a lot of work on over the years

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:03.060
is first looking
at a whole array

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:08.650
of sex differences between
normal human males and females.

00:11:08.650 --> 00:11:12.380
Sex differences, some of
it's the finger ratio stuff.

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:14.420
Some of it is
neural anatomy, some

00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:17.072
of those structural
differences in the brain,

00:11:17.072 --> 00:11:18.030
having to do with that.

00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:23.000
Some of it is functional spatial
skills versus language skills.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.450
Some of it is problem solving.

00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:28.990
And there is a gender
difference that

00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:33.210
tends to come through with that
on the average in that boys,

00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:36.680
males, men, take more
analytical approaches

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:38.460
to social problem solving.

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:42.600
Girls, women, females,
take more empathic ones.

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:44.790
So that's a difference.

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:46.760
OK, so he studied
all sorts of stuff

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:48.920
like that, and obviously
with hormones as well--

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:52.580
all sorts of really subtle
interesting physical

00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:55.310
differences, whole
array of these.

00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:59.030
And what he has shown is
that individuals with autism,

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:01.650
regardless of their
sex, tend to have

00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:04.570
even more exaggerated
versions of

00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:08.240
those male typical
profiles-- the finger length,

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:12.680
the analytical focus at
the cost of social empathy,

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:16.950
social affiliation, the
very strong spatial skills,

00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:18.400
whole bunch of those.

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:20.730
So he's made a fairly
convincing argument,

00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:22.490
I think, that is good.

00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:26.070
Something's going on in terms
of prenatal androgenization,

00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:31.770
perhaps, which produces a more
masculinized profile, which

00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:34.960
taken to its extreme
winds up being autism.

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:36.810
In other words,
normal male behavior

00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:39.220
is just skating on
thin ice before going

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:43.195
into this whole realm of sort
of dysfunctional socialization.

00:12:43.195 --> 00:12:44.730
Lots of stuff with
that, as we'll

00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:48.040
see next week some very
interesting differences

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:52.090
in the wiring of the cortex
of people with autism.

00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:56.340
And males show that same
thing, just not as extreme.

00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:59.910
OK, interesting footnote
thing-- Simon Baron-Cohen

00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:03.560
is apparently the cousin of
Sasha Baron-Cohen of Borat,

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:07.140
which suggests that must be one
interesting family when they

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:08.830
get together for the holidays.

00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:14.399
OK, moving back one
more box, however-- no,

00:13:14.399 --> 00:13:15.440
I'm not going to do that.

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:17.120
OK, moving back one more box.

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:20.320
Now, instead of
perinatal hormone stuff,

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:22.860
early environment,
what about genes?

00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:23.640
What about genes?

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:26.660
What do genes have to do
with aggression, competition,

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:28.540
cooperation, empathy, et cetera?

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:32.220
It used to be not that
long ago if you even raised

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:36.260
the possibility that there were
genetic elements to aggression,

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:39.030
you would be hounded
out of certain realms

00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:40.130
of social science.

00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:44.890
It was viewed as wildly
incorrect, wildly offensive,

00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:47.150
hidden agendas out the wazoo.

00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:51.600
For some reason, this began to
pass in the early '90s or so.

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:54.490
There were studies in
the mid '80s, conferences

00:13:54.490 --> 00:13:57.100
in the mid '80s, where
there were protests.

00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:59.910
They were picketed, because
in this meeting that

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:03.080
was considering the
sociology of aggression,

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:04.910
the this of aggression,
the biology,

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:07.000
the genetics, the
inclusion of it,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.140
was the grounds
for the picketing.

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:11.920
A number of those were canceled
by the National Institutes

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:15.470
of Health under public pressure
of certain interest groups, all

00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:16.120
of that.

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:19.430
It used to be viewed as
outrageously offensive,

00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:24.640
the notion that genes have
anything to do with aggression.

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:27.920
So there's two ways of
showing that that's wrong.

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:30.020
The first is to
sit somebody down

00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:33.190
and make them go through the
last 15 lectures in this class.

00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:35.990
Or the other is to
reflect on the fact

00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:38.170
that you would leave
a three-year-old

00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:41.850
in the care of a basset hound,
but not with a pit bull.

00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:47.000
Oh, there are breed-specific
differences in behavior.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.120
That, if nothing else,
is a demonstration of it,

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:53.910
that dog breeds have been
bred for 20,000 years or so

00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:56.350
to differ in levels
of aggression,

00:14:56.350 --> 00:14:59.000
in levels of
affiliation, all of that.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.440
People who for some bizarre
reason follow bullfighting,

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:06.180
there are lines of bulls,
different ranches of Spain

00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:08.370
in Mexico, where
they have been famous

00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:12.670
for centuries for the particular
fighting style of the bulls

00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:14.450
that they breed.

00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:15.940
Genes have something
to do with it.

00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:18.140
Of course they do,
because hormones

00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:19.400
have something to do with it.

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:22.010
And because receptors,
and because enzymes,

00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:25.590
and everything with that, it
is impossible to have talked

00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:28.140
about any of this stuff on
the far right of the chart

00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:32.350
without invoking genes--
a ludicrous view.

00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:35.310
So what is known about
the relevance of genes

00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:38.080
to aspects of
aggressive behavior?

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:39.900
First off, at this
stage, there's

00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:42.910
been a whole bunch of studies--
many of them winding up

00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:45.810
in some very visible
journals-- where people find

00:15:45.810 --> 00:15:50.797
a gene implicating it in
abnormal levels of aggression,

00:15:50.797 --> 00:15:52.130
one of those sorts of behaviors.

00:15:52.130 --> 00:15:55.480
Typical strategy-- these might
be genetically engineered

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:58.090
animals to remove that gene.

00:15:58.090 --> 00:16:00.640
Or there might be a
spontaneous mutation.

00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:03.020
And all of these
report that these

00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:05.830
are animals with a whole
bunch of these mutations,

00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:07.750
that these are animals
with abnormally

00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:10.200
high levels of aggression.

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:12.080
That's kind of a
clean experiment.

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:15.900
If you go in-- and thanks to
a mutation, or chopping out

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:18.190
one particular
gene, and now you've

00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:21.300
got a lot more aggression
in that individual.

00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:23.490
That kind of suggests
that that gene

00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:25.410
has something to do
with aggression, perhaps

00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:26.870
a whole lot.

00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:29.460
What are all the
problems with that?

00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:31.260
Other ways that
that gene could be

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:34.630
affecting behavior,
which indirectly winds up

00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:36.380
getting to aggression.

00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:39.440
One possibility-- what
if that's a gene that

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:42.570
is relevant to impulsivity?

00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:45.340
And this is an
individual who, if you

00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:47.970
gave the mouse a
different realm of tests,

00:16:47.970 --> 00:16:52.880
would be shouting its love
to the world at an impusively

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:55.050
high rate, just as
it's being aggressive

00:16:55.050 --> 00:16:56.910
at an impulsively high rate.

00:16:56.910 --> 00:17:01.080
Maybe it's a gene having
to do with impulsivity.

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:04.579
Maybe it's a gene having to
do with one of the things

00:17:04.579 --> 00:17:05.800
we heard in the last lecture.

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:08.640
What are the environmental
releasing stimuli

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:09.980
that cause aggression to occur?

00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:11.650
What's one of the
most reliable ones?

00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:13.150
Pain.

00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:16.329
Oh, it turned out a
number of these strains

00:17:16.329 --> 00:17:19.240
of mice that were identified
with a gene knock-out.

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:22.520
That here's a gene which
can cause aggression.

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:24.589
It turned out that
these were genes

00:17:24.589 --> 00:17:27.710
that made animals that were
much more sensitive to pain.

00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:30.380
And they were more
likely in a pain state

00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:34.200
to displace aggression
on to something else.

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:36.120
Or, as was shown
in some of these,

00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:38.150
these were animals who
were more aggressive.

00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:40.120
But they were also
more affiliative.

00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:43.640
And they were more everything.

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:47.020
Their generic level of
arousal was a lot higher.

00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:50.160
So all these caveats, an
awful lot of the genes

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:53.010
that popped up in the first
generation of those sorts

00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:56.230
of studies that looked
solid, that were replicated,

00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:59.810
a lot of them instead had
to do with indirect routes,

00:17:59.810 --> 00:18:02.940
rather than directly
with aggression itself.

00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:05.640
So what about the genes
that have held up?

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:08.640
And in the really
plausible candidate ones,

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:10.723
we've covered some of
these are already--

00:18:10.723 --> 00:18:15.780
the serotonin synthesis genes,
and the serotonin receptor

00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:17.740
genes, and the dopamine
receptor genes.

00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:21.580
All of those have been very
solidly implicated, really

00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:24.770
careful research, the
molecular biologists teaming up

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:26.510
with behaviorists
knew what they were

00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:29.120
doing-- a genetic component.

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:31.940
And what you know by now
that is absolutely about

00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:35.150
is this figure again.

00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:37.170
That's the case with
all of these genes.

00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:40.520
Oh my God, it's not
genes causing aggression.

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:42.730
We know exactly this
one, modulation,

00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:46.060
all that stuff, again
depending on the environment.

00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:49.090
And the environment
in the realm of genes

00:18:49.090 --> 00:18:50.970
relevant to aggression,
the environment

00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:55.890
is overwhelmingly about abuse
and stress early in life.

00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:59.850
So that's about as far as
genes will get you there,

00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:01.530
which is plenty
good, because this

00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:04.790
is exactly how the genes
should be relevant to behavior.

00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:07.880
This is how all genes
are relevant to behavior.

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:11.110
Remember our ultimate punchline
from the behavior of genetics--

00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:12.590
at the end of the
day, it actually

00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:16.410
doesn't make any sense to
ever say what any gene does,

00:19:16.410 --> 00:19:18.320
only what it does
in the following

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:20.680
range of environments.

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:24.000
In terms of that, what
you are beginning to find

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.780
is this still sort of
growing field which

00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:31.390
is beginning to look at
differences in these genotypes,

00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:33.910
these different
versions of these genes,

00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:37.460
in different populations,
in different cultures.

00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:40.330
And that's just beginning
as a literature.

00:19:40.330 --> 00:19:42.200
I'm not impressed
enough with the findings

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:43.720
yet that it's worth
passing them on.

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:47.680
But that is going to be
a very interesting field.

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:51.020
Finally, there's always this
puzzle with any of these of,

00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:54.130
oh, you've got some gene
that's predisposing you

00:19:54.130 --> 00:19:57.340
towards being aggressive if
you were abused in childhood.

00:19:57.340 --> 00:20:01.280
We still know nothing
in terms of that gene.

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:03.650
That gene has got
no predictive power

00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:07.330
as to whether this will thus
be someone who grows up and is

00:20:07.330 --> 00:20:09.030
a sociopathic murderer.

00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:13.240
Or if this is someone who grows
up and is just an unbelievably

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:15.820
nasty Monopoly player.

00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:19.620
That factor, again,
that same deal-- oh,

00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:22.120
major frontal cortical
damage, disinhibition.

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:24.130
You can't regulate
your behavior.

00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:27.590
No science in terms of
the neurobiology as to why

00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:30.260
one turns into a serial
murder, and the other one who

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:33.210
doesn't catch clues that the
family wants to eat dinner.

00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:36.090
Again, it's the same
puzzle over and over.

00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:39.190
And, again, you could begin to
guess what the differences are

00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:40.400
going to be.

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:43.710
Problems in some of these realms
with these aggressive genes,

00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:46.900
and different upbringings,
different stabilities

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:49.570
and families, different
relationships, different role

00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:52.950
models, you can be off
and running with that one.

00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:56.090
One final domain in
genes and aggression--

00:20:56.090 --> 00:20:58.690
and only a handful of
you the other lecture

00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:00.330
knew who that guy
Charles Whitman

00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:02.400
was, who was the
guy who climbed up

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:04.230
the Texas tower, all of that.

00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:07.000
OK, so here's another
chance to score points

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.100
in the mass murderer realm.

00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:11.720
How many people have ever heard
of a guy named Richard Speck?

00:21:14.816 --> 00:21:18.840
Wow, very few-- no hands.

00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:19.950
OK.

00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:22.850
No, that's a bottle
going up, not a hand.

00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:26.170
Richard Speck was once one
of the most notorious people

00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:27.180
in America.

00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:30.500
Richard Speck was a
nightmare sociopath

00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:34.780
who in 1968 committed
a crime that just

00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:37.130
stunned the entire country.

00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:39.410
People wrote songs about it.

00:21:39.410 --> 00:21:42.990
It was just as brutal
as one could imagine.

00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:47.420
He broke into the
apartment of eight nurses

00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:49.810
living in Chicago,
eight student nurses,

00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:51.950
and slaughtered them all.

00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:58.010
And this was shocking on a
level that's hard to describe.

00:21:58.010 --> 00:22:02.820
Richard Speck was the
nightmare sociopathic murderer.

00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:06.980
So he gets sent off to
prison eventually for life.

00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:09.860
And in the process at
some point or other,

00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:12.450
he's getting some physical exam.

00:22:12.450 --> 00:22:14.840
Somebody takes a blood
sample something.

00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:17.290
And a lab technician
notices something

00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:19.920
interesting in his
blood, examining

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:24.350
the chareotypes, the
structures, of his chromosomes.

00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:27.780
And they discovered that
he had an extremely rare

00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:30.160
chromosomal abnormality.

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:35.690
Females, XX, males,
XY-- every now

00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:38.140
and then you get somebody
where something screws up.

00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:41.270
And what you now get is XYY.

00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:43.760
You get an extra Y chromosome.

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:46.670
And, suddenly, this had
to be the explanation

00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:47.780
for what was going on.

00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:50.600
Males are a total pain in
the ass all over the world.

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:52.100
And they've got
those Y chromosomes.

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:52.680
Oh my God.

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:55.850
The guy has two Y chromosomes
in every single cell.

00:22:55.850 --> 00:22:56.730
This explains it.

00:22:56.730 --> 00:22:59.670
And this suddenly
started this hysteria

00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:02.840
about violence and the XYY male.

00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:05.620
Senators were
bellowing in Congress

00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:09.420
about how we needed to screen
our schoolteachers to make

00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:12.440
sure none of the men
had XYY profiles.

00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:16.410
The military was all set to
start testing recruits for XYY.

00:23:16.410 --> 00:23:18.800
Although it's not clear if
that would get you in or would

00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:21.020
that get you out,
how that one worked.

00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:22.610
But they were
suddenly interested.

00:23:22.610 --> 00:23:25.200
Tons of work went
into it, this flurry

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:27.120
of excitement, special funding.

00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:28.900
We need to be on top of this.

00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:31.150
And by the early '70s,
what was clear was

00:23:31.150 --> 00:23:33.460
there was no
relationship whatsoever.

00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:35.080
So that one went down the tubes.

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:37.390
And then one of those
ironic ending departments,

00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:40.990
it was eventually discovered
that a lab technician had

00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:43.680
blown, had done the
chareotyping wrong.

00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:46.340
And he really
wasn't an XYY male,

00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:49.150
despite that lab technician
then having called up

00:23:49.150 --> 00:23:50.080
the newspapers.

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:53.500
He was a normal XY
sociopathic male.

00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:56.870
So that one was up
there for a while,

00:23:56.870 --> 00:24:01.800
more realms of don't overvalue
the genetic evidence.

00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:05.060
So that shifts us now
one step further back.

00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:08.690
And now begin to look
at whole populations--

00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:12.050
whole populations not yet on
the genetic evolutionary level.

00:24:12.050 --> 00:24:14.810
But what do things
like ecology have

00:24:14.810 --> 00:24:16.940
to do with levels of aggression?

00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:19.313
What does culture
have to do with it?

00:24:19.313 --> 00:24:21.500
What does factors like that?

00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:26.240
And there's a really interesting
array of findings out there.

00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:28.870
First off, one
important dichotomy

00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:31.390
when looking at
traditional human cultures

00:24:31.390 --> 00:24:34.280
is how people make their living.

00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:35.900
And the one that's
pertinent here

00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:39.500
is the dichotomy between
pastoralist people

00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:40.910
and everybody else.

00:24:40.910 --> 00:24:44.590
Pastoralist people, nomadic
pastoralists people, these

00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:45.800
are cow people.

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:48.390
These are people who wander
around with their goats,

00:24:48.390 --> 00:24:49.750
or their camels.

00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:52.170
These are the
shepherds, in contrast

00:24:52.170 --> 00:24:56.610
to traditional
agriculturalists, or far rarer

00:24:56.610 --> 00:24:59.870
traditional hunter-gatherers--
so nomadic pastoralists

00:24:59.870 --> 00:25:01.490
versus everyone else.

00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:04.850
And what a boatload of
anthropology has shown

00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:09.770
is nomadic pastoralists have
higher rates of violence

00:25:09.770 --> 00:25:13.080
both within group
and between group.

00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:17.520
Nomadic pastoralists are vastly
more likely than other groups

00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:23.140
to have standing
armies, warrior classes,

00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:25.980
to have leadership be
derived from people

00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:29.570
who have had the most
success as a warrior,

00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:33.680
to have myths built around their
religion that success in war,

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:37.490
violent acclaim in war,
is your gateway to heaven,

00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:40.610
or whatever afterlife is
viewed as most desirable.

00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:42.430
This is a consistent finding.

00:25:42.430 --> 00:25:46.060
Lots and lots of these
cultures, nomadic pastoralists

00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:50.360
are the ones who came up with
warfare on a certain level,

00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:51.820
and warrior classes.

00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:54.110
And this makes perfect
sense, because one feature

00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:57.130
of being a nomadic
pastoralist is you're nomadic.

00:25:57.130 --> 00:25:59.730
At certain times of
the year, there's

00:25:59.730 --> 00:26:03.370
one subset of the whole
village who's off 15 miles

00:26:03.370 --> 00:26:05.350
away where there's
some good grazing.

00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:07.130
Another group is
on the other side.

00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:10.050
And what this sets you up for
is something that farmers never

00:26:10.050 --> 00:26:11.300
have to worry about.

00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:14.900
Somebody can't come and rustle
your farm away at night.

00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:17.800
But people can come and
steal all your animals.

00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:20.960
Warrior classes, so
that at any given point,

00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:24.910
if people are dispersed, there
is still a designated age group

00:26:24.910 --> 00:26:29.250
of individuals who are out there
to defend the collective herds

00:26:29.250 --> 00:26:30.530
of the group.

00:26:30.530 --> 00:26:32.030
So you see that.

00:26:32.030 --> 00:26:34.270
In the United States,
where that has had

00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:37.270
an interesting
manifestation is where

00:26:37.270 --> 00:26:40.350
people settled in the
original 13 colonies,

00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:42.510
from which part of
the United Kingdom.

00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:45.930
And some very influential
studies, really interesting

00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:49.750
creative ones, pointing
out that the American South

00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:53.050
was disproportionately
settled by sheep people

00:26:53.050 --> 00:26:56.330
from the northern ends
of the British Isles--

00:26:56.330 --> 00:26:58.920
in other words,
nomadic pastoralists.

00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:02.820
Shifting to another realm of
anthropological designation,

00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:06.510
these are people who
disproportionately have

00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:09.520
come from cultures of honor.

00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:12.940
Cultures of honor,
where people are

00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:17.290
willing to kill over very
symbolic slights rather

00:27:17.290 --> 00:27:20.420
than over material
conflicts, where there

00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:22.570
are vendettas within
the group, there

00:27:22.570 --> 00:27:24.980
are vendettas
between groups, where

00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:27.970
it is honorific
to have to avenge

00:27:27.970 --> 00:27:29.780
a death, which you
do not necessarily

00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:32.620
find in agriculturalists.

00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:35.880
Cultures of honor, and
that goes hand-in-hand

00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:37.430
with nomadic pastoralism.

00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:39.510
And what you get
there, typically,

00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:44.400
are very clear rules
about enforced hospitality

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:49.860
for guests, and very clear
rules of the circumstances

00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:54.430
of aggression, retributive
ones, over symbolic affronts.

00:27:54.430 --> 00:27:58.040
And that's really clear
difference regionally

00:27:58.040 --> 00:27:59.670
in this country.

00:27:59.670 --> 00:28:02.010
Interesting sociologist,
University of Michigan,

00:28:02.010 --> 00:28:04.020
named Richard Nesbett.

00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:05.490
And he grew up in the South.

00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:07.360
And I actually heard
him once give a talk

00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:10.870
where he talks about how
when he was about 18 or so,

00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:12.910
he left the South
for the first time

00:28:12.910 --> 00:28:16.090
and joined this very
strange culture at Harvard

00:28:16.090 --> 00:28:17.850
University as an undergraduate.

00:28:17.850 --> 00:28:22.500
And he was dumbfounded by how
different of a world this was.

00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:25.630
People didn't shoot
relatives at picnics,

00:28:25.630 --> 00:28:29.110
at barbecues, which
sounded totally facetious.

00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:31.530
But when you look
at the higher crime

00:28:31.530 --> 00:28:34.620
rates in the American
South, it is not

00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:36.620
occurring in urban areas.

00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:39.390
Urban crime is
roughly equivalent

00:28:39.390 --> 00:28:40.960
all throughout
the United States.

00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:43.910
It is not due to
higher rates of what

00:28:43.910 --> 00:28:47.970
they call 7-Eleven robberies,
which is just material

00:28:47.970 --> 00:28:49.940
gain, a robbery of that sort.

00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:52.010
It is murders of honor.

00:28:52.010 --> 00:28:55.520
It is people who know each
other at social settings,

00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:59.760
people who have some insult,
have something that has nothing

00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:01.660
to do with material wealth.

00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:04.330
This is where the
disproportionate violence comes

00:29:04.330 --> 00:29:06.640
from in the American South.

00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:08.750
And prompted by
that, Nesbett did

00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:12.810
one of the all-time interesting
studies, this famous, amazing

00:29:12.810 --> 00:29:13.510
study.

00:29:13.510 --> 00:29:15.590
So he's at the
University of Michigan.

00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:18.630
And he recruits
student volunteers

00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:25.630
who believe they're going
in to do a hopscotch test,

00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:26.566
or some such thing.

00:29:26.566 --> 00:29:27.440
And they're going in.

00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:29.970
But he made a point of finding
out where everyone came from.

00:29:29.970 --> 00:29:32.620
And he got a fairly
even distribution

00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:35.000
between the relatively
few students in Michigan

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.380
from the American
South, and then students

00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:39.210
from the more traditional North.

00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:42.300
So we get into the psych
building, each individual who's

00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:44.100
coming for their appointment.

00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:45.351
And they take the elevator.

00:29:45.351 --> 00:29:46.100
And they come out.

00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:47.610
And they walk down the hall.

00:29:47.610 --> 00:29:50.440
And this is where the
experiment happens.

00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:53.190
Nesbett has somebody
working on the project--

00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:59.530
a confederate on the project,
I say making a lame pun, OK.

00:29:59.530 --> 00:30:01.652
So a confederate on
the project, a person

00:30:01.652 --> 00:30:02.610
working on the project.

00:30:02.610 --> 00:30:06.160
And this was a big, beefy guy.

00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:09.600
And the whole idea was
that this big, beefy guy

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:11.790
was going to do
something insulting

00:30:11.790 --> 00:30:15.765
to this individual walking
down the hallway, all male.

00:30:15.765 --> 00:30:16.640
Here's what they did.

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:19.250
They clearly did
a lot of thinking

00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:22.560
in designing this study, in
terms of what single word

00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:24.270
this person was going to say.

00:30:24.270 --> 00:30:26.560
And this is what
he wound up saying.

00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:28.700
The volunteer would be
walking down the hall.

00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:31.720
Here comes this big,
beefy guy moving fast.

00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:34.850
And as he comes by him, bumps
into him with his shoulder,

00:30:34.850 --> 00:30:39.710
walks past, and says, watch it,
asshole, and then disappears.

00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:42.020
Volunteer comes in
to start their study,

00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:45.620
and quickly they look at blood
pressure, and heart rate,

00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:48.430
and stress hormone levels,
and testosterone levels,

00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:52.370
and get a typical participant
in this study from the North.

00:30:52.370 --> 00:30:53.360
And they come in.

00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:55.670
And they're a little bit
irritated, and what a jerk,

00:30:55.670 --> 00:30:56.336
and all of that.

00:30:56.336 --> 00:30:58.240
And it's all over with
two minutes later.

00:30:58.240 --> 00:30:59.820
Get people from
the American South,

00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:03.560
on the average massive stress
response, hypertension,

00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:07.510
elevated testosterone levels,
big regional differences.

00:31:07.510 --> 00:31:09.770
These are some of the
physiological pictures

00:31:09.770 --> 00:31:13.010
of cultures of honor.

00:31:13.010 --> 00:31:13.860
What else?

00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:17.790
What other interesting things
about ecosystems, or ecology,

00:31:17.790 --> 00:31:19.050
or cultural aspects?

00:31:19.050 --> 00:31:23.020
Another dichotomy that is
really consistent-- and this one

00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:26.290
maps pretty readily on that
pastoralist versus everybody

00:31:26.290 --> 00:31:30.470
else-- the sorts of cultures
and the level of violence

00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:32.930
that are generated
in cultures that live

00:31:32.930 --> 00:31:36.840
in deserts versus rain forests.

00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:39.500
And, once again,
deserts are where

00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:43.080
you are far more likely to
find nomadic pastoralists, rain

00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:46.660
forests, hunter-gatherers,
mixture of hunter-gatherers,

00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:49.960
small farm agriculturists--
two totally different worlds

00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:51.100
of occupations.

00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:53.720
And what you see
is far higher rates

00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:56.360
of violence within
group and between groups

00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:57.860
in desert dwellers.

00:31:57.860 --> 00:32:02.230
And that maps very
logically onto pastoralists

00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:03.840
versus everybody else.

00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:06.950
Desert dwellers, open
savanna grasslands,

00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:09.520
that's where you see
the warrior classes.

00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:12.010
That's where you see
raiding of other tribes.

00:32:12.010 --> 00:32:15.120
That's where you get that
pattern, virtually none

00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:17.420
among the hunter-gatherers.

00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:19.020
I might point out
something which

00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:21.910
will become sort of focused
on more in a lecture in about

00:32:21.910 --> 00:32:23.540
a week or so.

00:32:23.540 --> 00:32:28.490
I should point out that desert
dweller nomadic pastoralists

00:32:28.490 --> 00:32:30.450
are also the cultures
on this planet that

00:32:30.450 --> 00:32:33.110
invented monotheism.

00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:35.880
Consistent difference--
desert dwellers

00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:37.550
tend more towards monotheism.

00:32:37.550 --> 00:32:40.660
And it was invented by
desert nomadic pastoralists.

00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:43.640
Rainforest cultures
far disproportionately

00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:45.700
tend to be polytheistic.

00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:47.620
And this is not
remotely surprising.

00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:49.560
If you're living in a
rainforest and there's

00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:52.707
10,000 different types of
edible plants around there,

00:32:52.707 --> 00:32:55.040
it doesn't take a lot of work
to come up with the notion

00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:58.850
that there's lots of different
spirits and gods out there.

00:32:58.850 --> 00:33:03.580
What the desert it is about is
one, singular baked truth there

00:33:03.580 --> 00:33:04.930
of surviving.

00:33:04.930 --> 00:33:07.070
That's where
monotheism was born.

00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:08.980
Monotheism,
historically, is more

00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:12.850
associated with cultures that
invented warfare, and invented

00:33:12.850 --> 00:33:16.750
warrior classes, and raiding,
and things of that sort.

00:33:16.750 --> 00:33:19.030
That's kind of interesting.

00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:23.450
OK, moving on, more cultural
differences-- one of the great,

00:33:23.450 --> 00:33:28.840
great predictors of having a
society with lots of violence

00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:31.250
in it, and lots of
warfare elsewhere,

00:33:31.250 --> 00:33:35.370
is a culture that has
rots of cultural myths

00:33:35.370 --> 00:33:37.180
of victimization.

00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:40.690
We have been screwed
historically, because of this,

00:33:40.690 --> 00:33:45.060
this, and this, and coupled
with that an ethos of not

00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:48.520
turning the other cheek,
but instead of retribution.

00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:52.360
Cultures that have
strong histories

00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:55.850
and or myths of victimization,
and strong values

00:33:55.850 --> 00:33:59.930
built around retribution are
extremely violent societies,

00:33:59.930 --> 00:34:03.580
and often really bad
news as neighbors.

00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:05.030
What else?

00:34:05.030 --> 00:34:07.660
Amazing study that got
published about a year ago,

00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:10.460
which is on the
recommended reading list.

00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:11.679
This is not required.

00:34:11.679 --> 00:34:14.710
But this was a deeply
interesting study.

00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:15.210
It

00:34:15.210 --> 00:34:17.110
Was one of those
game theory studies.

00:34:17.110 --> 00:34:18.980
It was a game a little
bit like prisoner's

00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:22.800
dilemma-- not exactly the same,
but the same sort of notions

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:26.350
that you could be very generous
in your game playing style.

00:34:26.350 --> 00:34:28.310
You could be absolutely
rationally fair.

00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:31.639
You could be exploited, a
whole range of possibilities.

00:34:31.639 --> 00:34:33.500
What these guys
did in this study

00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:38.750
was take scads of people
from 40 different countries.

00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:41.210
No they didn't,
from 16, 19, they

00:34:41.210 --> 00:34:44.940
took from a bunch of
different countries.

00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:47.590
And just to control for
things, all of the subjects

00:34:47.590 --> 00:34:49.170
were university students.

00:34:49.170 --> 00:34:52.380
So you're selecting for a
fairly homogeneous bunch,

00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:55.459
both within group and across
these different countries.

00:34:55.459 --> 00:34:59.200
And what they did was they
had people play these games.

00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:03.630
And they had the option for what
is called altruistic punishing,

00:35:03.630 --> 00:35:07.340
which we will hear more about
in a little while, which is you

00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:11.290
have the option to expend
some of your resources--

00:35:11.290 --> 00:35:13.560
your points, your
chips, whatever--

00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:18.269
you can spend to punish the
other individual for cheating.

00:35:18.269 --> 00:35:19.810
And the question,
of course, becomes,

00:35:19.810 --> 00:35:22.576
how much are you willing
to spend to punish somebody

00:35:22.576 --> 00:35:24.200
when they've been
cheating against you,

00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:26.780
when they've been stingy, when
they haven't reciprocated,

00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:28.040
all of that?

00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:30.930
First finding,
which is everybody

00:35:30.930 --> 00:35:32.820
across all the
countries averaged out

00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:35.660
to the same rate, the
percentage of resources

00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:37.340
that someone is
willing to expend

00:35:37.340 --> 00:35:41.410
on punishing a cheater-- so no
particular cultural differences

00:35:41.410 --> 00:35:42.222
there.

00:35:42.222 --> 00:35:46.180
But then they identified
another interesting realm

00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:49.790
of game behavior here,
which they called antisocial

00:35:49.790 --> 00:35:52.650
punishment, which
is where it's not

00:35:52.650 --> 00:35:55.770
that you are expending some
of your resources to punish

00:35:55.770 --> 00:35:57.280
somebody for having cheated.

00:35:57.280 --> 00:35:59.440
It's where you're
expending resources

00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:04.070
to punish someone for
having been overly generous.

00:36:04.070 --> 00:36:07.210
And that pops up in
certain sorts of games.

00:36:07.210 --> 00:36:09.240
It is not terribly
common when it's

00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:12.140
the person who is choosing
with their opponent.

00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:14.520
But when you have
a third party, you

00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:17.210
have no cultural differences
at the rate at which they

00:36:17.210 --> 00:36:18.940
are willing to punish cheaters.

00:36:18.940 --> 00:36:21.270
But here's where
the differences came

00:36:21.270 --> 00:36:24.720
then, the rate at which
people would punish

00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:27.330
unexpectedly generous players.

00:36:27.330 --> 00:36:29.320
And you got a big spread.

00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:31.630
The lowest rate at
which this happened

00:36:31.630 --> 00:36:34.930
was, nicely, as it
turned out, people

00:36:34.930 --> 00:36:37.840
from this country, which is kind
of nice, people from England.

00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:39.790
And, of course, who else?

00:36:39.790 --> 00:36:44.450
The ever-useful Scandinavians
with their powerhouses

00:36:44.450 --> 00:36:47.510
of the cells and their
other cliches all set.

00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:49.820
So the Scandinavians
come through yet again.

00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:51.870
But, for once, we're able
to hang out with them

00:36:51.870 --> 00:36:54.230
and actually count as
having a good profile--

00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:57.390
the lowest rates of
people being willing to do

00:36:57.390 --> 00:37:02.040
this nutso anti-social
punishing in those countries.

00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:05.580
In between rates-- a number
of Middle Eastern countries,

00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:10.060
a large number of Eastern
Bloc countries, in other words

00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:13.712
Slavic ones that used to be
part of the Soviet Union, Korea,

00:37:13.712 --> 00:37:15.220
and turkey.

00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:16.630
Those were the middle ones.

00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:18.580
Which ones had the worst rates?

00:37:18.580 --> 00:37:20.520
I will just read the
two countries here

00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:23.520
that were way up there,
a big gap between them

00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:24.770
and the rest of the countries.

00:37:24.770 --> 00:37:27.210
One was Greece.

00:37:27.210 --> 00:37:32.810
And the other were the Arabic
Emirates on the Saudi Arabian

00:37:32.810 --> 00:37:37.840
Peninsula, where people
are willing to spend more

00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:41.000
to do anti-social
punishing than they

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:43.830
are willing to spend
to punish cheaters,

00:37:43.830 --> 00:37:45.910
extraordinary finding.

00:37:45.910 --> 00:37:49.660
People from Muscat, which
was where the university was,

00:37:49.660 --> 00:37:53.210
those students were more
willing to punish someone

00:37:53.210 --> 00:37:56.570
for being unexpectedly
generous than for somebody

00:37:56.570 --> 00:38:02.200
cheating on a game theory social
contract-- totally amazing.

00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:03.290
So what's that about?

00:38:03.290 --> 00:38:05.080
When they actually
question people,

00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:06.870
you see things with
people from there

00:38:06.870 --> 00:38:09.300
along the lines
of, if people start

00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:11.750
doing that, of being
all generous like that,

00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:13.970
it's just going to up
the ante for everybody.

00:38:13.970 --> 00:38:16.520
Everybody's going to
have to start doing that.

00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:18.370
That's an interesting
piece of reasoning.

00:38:18.370 --> 00:38:21.220
But when you look at a larger
level, what these researchers

00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:23.790
then showed was a
predictor across all

00:38:23.790 --> 00:38:25.620
these different
societies of the rate

00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:30.340
of this anti-social punishment
levels of trust in the society.

00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:33.170
Some standard metrics
used by sociologists

00:38:33.170 --> 00:38:37.110
who were interested in this
concept of social capital--

00:38:37.110 --> 00:38:40.610
how much social trust there
is in the society, how

00:38:40.610 --> 00:38:44.230
much participation there is,
how much of a sense of efficacy.

00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:46.630
And what you see is
the lower the levels

00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:49.290
of social capital
in these societies,

00:38:49.290 --> 00:38:52.990
the higher the rates of this
anti-social punishment, totally

00:38:52.990 --> 00:38:55.040
interesting study.

00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:57.580
Next in the realm
of culture, what

00:38:57.580 --> 00:38:59.980
are people doing
these days, what

00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:02.420
is sort of the science and
the research these days,

00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:05.270
trying to make
sense of terrorism,

00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:07.650
and the sort of cultures
that give rise to them,

00:39:07.650 --> 00:39:10.760
and the sort of ideologies
that give rise to them?

00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:13.400
A number of basic
dichotomies-- one

00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:16.130
is a camp that
views it as always

00:39:16.130 --> 00:39:18.840
abnormal sociopathic behavior.

00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:21.250
Another is a camp that
just views terrorism

00:39:21.250 --> 00:39:24.080
as extremes of ideology.

00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:27.920
The first one is much more
about individual dysfunction--

00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:31.040
oh, this is a neuropsychiatric
problem, perhaps.

00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:33.620
The second one is
one more a feature

00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:36.820
of cultures that have
extremely strong ideologies.

00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:39.720
So that's one division in
there as to how to think

00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:41.320
about it in the community.

00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:44.040
Another division is
really interesting.

00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:46.550
And it's one my reading
of this literature

00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:49.580
that has totally thrown people
in the field for a loop.

00:39:49.580 --> 00:39:52.870
Forever, there has
been a profile,

00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:55.290
a demographic and
psychological profile,

00:39:55.290 --> 00:39:57.550
of individuals who
are terrorists,

00:39:57.550 --> 00:40:00.300
all the way back to the
people who did the Boston Tea

00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:02.920
Party in this country, the IRA.

00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:05.840
All sorts of stuff like
that, the Haganah, which

00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:09.440
was in Israel, terrorist
acts before independence,

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:11.420
studied in a whole
bunch of these

00:40:11.420 --> 00:40:14.570
that there tends to be a
rather consistent profile

00:40:14.570 --> 00:40:17.190
of these individuals
who would be terrorists.

00:40:17.190 --> 00:40:26.030
Young, male, socially isolated,
socially unaffiliated in terms

00:40:26.030 --> 00:40:31.930
of relationships, relatively
uneducated background,

00:40:31.930 --> 00:40:39.710
history of childhood abuse, and
another factor which has just

00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:43.410
completely slipped my mind.

00:40:43.410 --> 00:40:46.230
What was it?

00:40:46.230 --> 00:40:47.200
Oh you all know.

00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:49.620
OK, so that's exactly what
you find in these folks--

00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:53.830
a picture of isolated
sociopathic individuals

00:40:53.830 --> 00:40:57.150
who already have a history
of anti-social behavior.

00:40:57.150 --> 00:40:59.630
These are people who,
if they hadn't stumbled

00:40:59.630 --> 00:41:01.460
into this cause,
would be spending

00:41:01.460 --> 00:41:03.840
their time mugging old ladies.

00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:05.340
That would be that profile.

00:41:05.340 --> 00:41:07.630
And you look at
these various groups.

00:41:07.630 --> 00:41:10.010
And that has been
a consistent one.

00:41:10.010 --> 00:41:13.540
Terrorism in the recent years,
particularly Middle Eastern

00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:17.120
fundamentalist, is a
completely different profile.

00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:19.440
It is not young men.

00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:22.680
It tends to be educated,
well-off people

00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:27.390
in their thirties and forties,
overwhelmingly middle class

00:41:27.390 --> 00:41:29.990
or upper class backgrounds.

00:41:29.990 --> 00:41:32.850
Next, it's not just
middle-aged males.

00:41:32.850 --> 00:41:34.180
It's females.

00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:36.860
It's women to a much
higher extent than seen

00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:39.430
in any previous
sort of population

00:41:39.430 --> 00:41:41.620
dealing with terrorism.

00:41:41.620 --> 00:41:45.030
Next what you see is
these are individuals

00:41:45.030 --> 00:41:47.860
who, on the average,
tend not to have

00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:52.500
had any direct exposure
to the suppression

00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:54.910
that they are fighting against.

00:41:54.910 --> 00:41:58.830
As opposed to the sociopathic
model, a classic picture

00:41:58.830 --> 00:42:03.180
with IRA gunman, the father
was taken away by the whoevers,

00:42:03.180 --> 00:42:05.150
shot, never came back again.

00:42:05.150 --> 00:42:07.420
And they were passed
on the family mantle.

00:42:07.420 --> 00:42:10.300
The current picture is
a very different oe--

00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:15.350
no direct experience
of the persecution.

00:42:15.350 --> 00:42:19.550
Finally, tending not to have
particularly high levels

00:42:19.550 --> 00:42:24.020
of religiosity, and this is
this very contemporary profile

00:42:24.020 --> 00:42:27.720
where you get these 40-year-old
engineers who are suicide

00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:29.850
bombers, where they go home.

00:42:29.850 --> 00:42:31.390
They say goodbye
to their families.

00:42:31.390 --> 00:42:34.730
They make a video tape sort
of wishing everybody well.

00:42:34.730 --> 00:42:37.250
And after having quit their
job and paying the rent one

00:42:37.250 --> 00:42:40.440
extra month, and off they
go and blow themselves up.

00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:43.190
People, I sense, in the
field haven't a clue

00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:46.880
how to make sense of what
this is about, very new,

00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:48.440
challenging feature.

00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:52.160
One interpretation,
one is of a school

00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:54.120
pushed by people
like Phil Zimbardo

00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:57.330
here in the psychology
department, incredibly

00:42:57.330 --> 00:43:01.130
influential psychologist, who as
a general theme over the years

00:43:01.130 --> 00:43:04.600
has argued for the stance that
under the right circumstances,

00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:07.000
under the right
coercive circumstances,

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:10.940
virtually anybody could do
anything that is appalling.

00:43:10.940 --> 00:43:15.180
Zimbardo, who did the famed
Stanford prison study.

00:43:15.180 --> 00:43:18.420
The other view is, OK,
this isn't a lesson

00:43:18.420 --> 00:43:22.927
that anybody could wind up being
this violent if, look at them.

00:43:22.927 --> 00:43:23.760
They're an engineer.

00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:26.260
And they've got a master's
degree, and all of that.

00:43:26.260 --> 00:43:30.270
Instead, it is simply an outcome
of a lot of what terrorism

00:43:30.270 --> 00:43:33.320
is about these days,
a very novel world

00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:36.000
of international terrorism.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.560
Rather than within
country, suddenly you

00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:41.460
have a world of people who
need to be able to do things

00:43:41.460 --> 00:43:45.410
like get passports, and
fly elsewhere, and be

00:43:45.410 --> 00:43:48.760
able to navigate customs,
and things of that sort.

00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:52.150
It is suddenly selecting for a
more sophisticated population

00:43:52.150 --> 00:43:53.540
of individuals.

00:43:53.540 --> 00:43:55.450
You know, the jury's
out on all of this.

00:43:55.450 --> 00:43:58.280
But this seems to be a
very challenging thing

00:43:58.280 --> 00:44:00.310
for that field.

00:44:00.310 --> 00:44:04.340
OK, so now this allows us to
push one step further back.

00:44:04.340 --> 00:44:06.480
I'm going to skip over
a few things there.

00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:09.870
Now, insofar as we are
looking at culture,

00:44:09.870 --> 00:44:13.080
and insofar as we have looked
at anthropological differences,

00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:15.730
and insofar as we have
looked at anything having

00:44:15.730 --> 00:44:19.350
to do with genes, we now
have to talk about evolution,

00:44:19.350 --> 00:44:22.330
because that's where the
genes came from, of course.

00:44:22.330 --> 00:44:24.860
So in first pass,
it's absolutely simple

00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:27.600
to understand what evolution
has to do with aggression, which

00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:31.080
is evolution selects for higher
and higher levels of aggression

00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:33.420
because that's what
you need to succeed.

00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:35.860
Unless you grew up watching
certain types of television

00:44:35.860 --> 00:44:38.150
programs, in which
case evolution selects

00:44:38.150 --> 00:44:40.460
for no aggression
occurring because animals

00:44:40.460 --> 00:44:42.960
behave for the good
of the species.

00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:45.130
So sorting through
that, beginning now

00:44:45.130 --> 00:44:48.230
to apply some of our
foundations from that world,

00:44:48.230 --> 00:44:53.480
individual selection, kin
selection, reciprocal altruism,

00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:56.910
and the modern version
of group selection.

00:44:56.910 --> 00:44:58.610
So where do these play out?

00:44:58.610 --> 00:45:01.030
First, how do these
play out in terms

00:45:01.030 --> 00:45:05.020
of increasing the likelihood
of aggression and antisocial

00:45:05.020 --> 00:45:06.430
behavior?

00:45:06.430 --> 00:45:10.810
Individual selection, males,
that is absolutely simple.

00:45:10.810 --> 00:45:16.270
In every culture on this
planet, and in the vast majority

00:45:16.270 --> 00:45:18.710
of social species that
have been looked at,

00:45:18.710 --> 00:45:21.560
the majority, the major
cause of aggression

00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:25.030
in that society or species
is male male violence

00:45:25.030 --> 00:45:27.820
over reproductive
access to females.

00:45:27.820 --> 00:45:30.340
That is close to a universal.

00:45:30.340 --> 00:45:33.060
That is the most
common form motivator

00:45:33.060 --> 00:45:36.370
of violence on this planet,
humans and otherwise.

00:45:36.370 --> 00:45:38.630
So that one's easy
to come up with,

00:45:38.630 --> 00:45:40.850
in terms of obvious stuff.

00:45:40.850 --> 00:45:44.920
One classic study,
insanely controversial one,

00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:48.680
that appeared to be the
landmark demonstration of some

00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:52.090
of the same in humans--
traditional tribe,

00:45:52.090 --> 00:45:55.480
hunter-gatherer down in
Venezuela in the Amazon

00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:58.080
called the Yanomamo
who have been

00:45:58.080 --> 00:46:01.130
the darlings of high
testosterone male

00:46:01.130 --> 00:46:03.290
anthropologists for decades.

00:46:03.290 --> 00:46:07.430
These have been intensely
studied people, many decades

00:46:07.430 --> 00:46:09.690
now, predominantly by
an anthropologist named

00:46:09.690 --> 00:46:13.060
Napoleon Chagnon, who is now
emeritus at Santa Barbara.

00:46:13.060 --> 00:46:15.550
But he has been a major
figure in anthropology

00:46:15.550 --> 00:46:16.760
for a long time.

00:46:16.760 --> 00:46:21.380
And these people are insanely
aggressive, incredibly high

00:46:21.380 --> 00:46:25.090
rates of violence between
groups, within groups.

00:46:25.090 --> 00:46:28.630
Sufficiently so that
the written monographs

00:46:28.630 --> 00:46:30.663
of the Yanamamo, with
titles like Yanamamo,

00:46:30.663 --> 00:46:33.420
the fierce people,
things of that sort.

00:46:33.420 --> 00:46:36.360
And about 15 years ago,
Chagnon published a paper

00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:39.630
in Science using
decade's worth of data

00:46:39.630 --> 00:46:44.700
showing that the more people,
particular men in this society,

00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:48.760
in this tribe, the more people
you have killed on the average,

00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:51.700
the higher your
reproductive success

00:46:51.700 --> 00:46:52.532
That's it.

00:46:52.532 --> 00:46:53.364
That's it.

00:46:53.364 --> 00:46:54.900
That's everything right there.

00:46:54.900 --> 00:46:56.680
That's Darwin all
over the place.

00:46:56.680 --> 00:46:58.380
Just play it out over time.

00:46:58.380 --> 00:47:02.760
And this is dramatic selection
in a traditional human society,

00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:07.390
the reproductive rewards
of violence and murder.

00:47:07.390 --> 00:47:10.290
Very major, influential
study, picked up

00:47:10.290 --> 00:47:11.520
by all the newspapers.

00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:14.330
And it has been completely
mired in controversy

00:47:14.330 --> 00:47:18.730
ever since, all sorts of
ethical attacks on Chagnon,

00:47:18.730 --> 00:47:20.240
most of which that
have not stuck,

00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:23.910
but some really, really telling
dissections of the work,

00:47:23.910 --> 00:47:26.140
ripping it apart on
statistical grounds.

00:47:26.140 --> 00:47:28.790
I don't think it's
actually for real.

00:47:28.790 --> 00:47:32.740
But that as easily interpreted
within that framework.

00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:35.830
Then more realms of violence,
individual selection,

00:47:35.830 --> 00:47:39.570
orangutans raping each,
rape in other species,

00:47:39.570 --> 00:47:42.180
rape among humans, which
of course brings up

00:47:42.180 --> 00:47:45.650
the question of whether
rape is more about passing

00:47:45.650 --> 00:47:49.850
on copies of your genes, or more
about power and subjugation.

00:47:49.850 --> 00:47:51.800
And the overwhelming
sense in the field

00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:53.760
is it's about the latter.

00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:57.460
It does not have a whole
lot to do with a world

00:47:57.460 --> 00:48:00.330
where you have to start counting
numbers of copies of genes,

00:48:00.330 --> 00:48:04.260
and thinking about
adaptiveness of strategies.

00:48:04.260 --> 00:48:08.280
Next, individual selection,
explaining another realm

00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:11.560
of violence-- in most
cultures, and in an awful lot

00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:15.460
of species looked at, the
second leading cause of violence

00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:22.360
is males attacking females
over denial of sexual access.

00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:27.280
And this is amazingly
common all over the place,

00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:29.490
the second leading
cause of violence

00:48:29.490 --> 00:48:32.620
on this planet across humans
and different cultures,

00:48:32.620 --> 00:48:37.630
and obvious easy individual
selection explanation there.

00:48:37.630 --> 00:48:40.550
Finally, another realm
individual selection,

00:48:40.550 --> 00:48:43.490
the world of female
female competition,

00:48:43.490 --> 00:48:46.360
and infanticide,
competitive infanticide.

00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:47.980
We know how to run all of those.

00:48:47.980 --> 00:48:50.240
So lots of reasons
within the framework

00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:53.230
of individual selection
to see where you are

00:48:53.230 --> 00:48:55.420
increasing rates of aggression.

00:48:55.420 --> 00:48:59.270
Next, kin selection-- you're
going to know that one as well.

00:48:59.270 --> 00:49:02.780
Two brothers or eight cousins,
and that whole strategy,

00:49:02.780 --> 00:49:05.370
and that's why
related individuals

00:49:05.370 --> 00:49:09.280
cooperate with each other in
circumstances of aggression.

00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:13.970
Chimpanzees--
chimps are function

00:49:13.970 --> 00:49:16.430
where females are the ones
who pick up at puberty

00:49:16.430 --> 00:49:17.490
and go elsewhere.

00:49:17.490 --> 00:49:20.070
So all of the adult
males in a chimp group

00:49:20.070 --> 00:49:23.730
are brothers, first cousins,
things of that sort.

00:49:23.730 --> 00:49:26.620
And, thus, you get
one of the outcomes

00:49:26.620 --> 00:49:29.850
of that, high levels of
male male cooperation.

00:49:29.850 --> 00:49:33.630
And as we heard, that has been
reported by Goodall and others

00:49:33.630 --> 00:49:36.250
to result in things
that look absolutely

00:49:36.250 --> 00:49:39.140
like organized
warfare and genocide,

00:49:39.140 --> 00:49:42.460
eradicating all the males in
a group in the next valley

00:49:42.460 --> 00:49:46.190
over, purely along
kinship lines.

00:49:46.190 --> 00:49:47.640
What else?

00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:51.440
Other primates, old world
primates, monkeys like baboons,

00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:55.530
aggression is very much
between lineages than within,

00:49:55.530 --> 00:49:58.600
same exact kin selection
sort of arguments.

00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:00.620
So what happens when
you get to humans?

00:50:00.620 --> 00:50:03.960
Things get more
complicated, of course.

00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:07.675
The first one being that
a relative, relatives,

00:50:07.675 --> 00:50:12.510
is a relative term, in
that it is a sliding scale.

00:50:12.510 --> 00:50:15.440
Wonderful quote to that
effect, a Bedouin quote,

00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:19.700
which is, it's my
brothers, my cousins, and I

00:50:19.700 --> 00:50:21.820
against the world.

00:50:21.820 --> 00:50:26.140
And it's my brothers and
I against my cousins.

00:50:26.140 --> 00:50:29.160
As in, who counts as an
us, and who counts as a

00:50:29.160 --> 00:50:31.280
them is a sliding measure.

00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:33.620
It is a relative measure.

00:50:33.620 --> 00:50:35.540
What you see is by
the time you get

00:50:35.540 --> 00:50:40.210
to humans capacity for very
rapid shifts of us/them

00:50:40.210 --> 00:50:43.040
along the lines of relatedness.

00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:45.680
Now, one of the readings,
which I can't remember now

00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:48.190
if I actually did stick
into an assignment,

00:50:48.190 --> 00:50:52.270
but one of the readings looks
at the classic social biological

00:50:52.270 --> 00:50:55.370
interpretation of making
sense of aggression

00:50:55.370 --> 00:50:57.070
along the lines
of kin selection.

00:50:57.070 --> 00:51:00.360
What do you make of child abuse?

00:51:00.360 --> 00:51:04.020
What do you make of homicidal
parents, damaging parents?

00:51:04.020 --> 00:51:07.620
How do you make sense of that
in a, are you out of your mind?

00:51:07.620 --> 00:51:11.510
This is copies of your genes
there, the challenges to that.

00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:15.280
And this is a couple, Daley and
Wilson, University of Toronto,

00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:17.690
I think, who have for
decades been working

00:51:17.690 --> 00:51:22.440
in this area showing
things like a child is

00:51:22.440 --> 00:51:26.470
more likely to be
abused by a stepfather

00:51:26.470 --> 00:51:28.500
than a biological father.

00:51:28.500 --> 00:51:30.120
Wonder what that's about?

00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:32.380
Kin selection, that's easy.

00:51:32.380 --> 00:51:34.410
A child is more
likely to be abused

00:51:34.410 --> 00:51:38.760
by a paternal grandparent
than a maternal one.

00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:42.500
Kin selection explanation--
more certainty of paternity

00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:45.130
when something is going
through a female line.

00:51:45.130 --> 00:51:46.840
So they've been
all these studies

00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:50.040
showing that degree
of relatedness

00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:52.830
explains a fair amount of
the variability in patterns

00:51:52.830 --> 00:51:56.280
of violence within families.

00:51:56.280 --> 00:51:58.790
Problems with it--
two problems, one

00:51:58.790 --> 00:52:01.710
is there's been a lot of
failure of replications

00:52:01.710 --> 00:52:03.120
in other societies.

00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:06.400
The Scandinavians, for
example, don't see that pattern

00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:07.420
when they study it.

00:52:07.420 --> 00:52:09.850
The other is there's
alternative models.

00:52:09.850 --> 00:52:12.330
There's economic
models, for example.

00:52:12.330 --> 00:52:17.050
When times get tough in
terms of displacement,

00:52:17.050 --> 00:52:18.940
family violence increases.

00:52:18.940 --> 00:52:21.630
Families with stepfathers,
on the average,

00:52:21.630 --> 00:52:23.970
are under more economic
duress than families

00:52:23.970 --> 00:52:27.820
with biological fathers, greater
likelihood of violence there.

00:52:27.820 --> 00:52:30.440
It is a very
uncontrolled literature.

00:52:30.440 --> 00:52:33.022
That is sort of viewed
as in the classic,

00:52:33.022 --> 00:52:36.620
and in other people's view, the
most ideologically most extreme

00:52:36.620 --> 00:52:39.760
way in which social biologists
think about something as

00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:44.560
bizarre and challenging as close
relatives killing each other.

00:52:44.560 --> 00:52:48.760
One final realm, which is in
terms of this us/them stuff,

00:52:48.760 --> 00:52:52.630
the point here being, how do you
decide who is an us and them?

00:52:52.630 --> 00:52:55.860
And suddenly, we're in
our world of ethology.

00:52:55.860 --> 00:53:00.390
Do we make some us/them
dichotomies more easily

00:53:00.390 --> 00:53:01.520
than others?

00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:04.580
Do we have prepared
learning to see

00:53:04.580 --> 00:53:09.460
some differences as more
salient than others in us/thems?

00:53:09.460 --> 00:53:12.740
That remains an immensely
controversial subject

00:53:12.740 --> 00:53:16.530
in terms of what are the natural
categories that young kids

00:53:16.530 --> 00:53:18.320
divide people up by?

00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:21.950
Are kids colorblind in
terms of skin color?

00:53:21.950 --> 00:53:25.020
Are kids blind in
terms of body types,

00:53:25.020 --> 00:53:26.340
in terms of some such things?

00:53:26.340 --> 00:53:29.680
Lots of work in this
area, how unnatural

00:53:29.680 --> 00:53:31.740
are some of the
us/them dichotomies

00:53:31.740 --> 00:53:33.190
that we tend to come up with?

00:53:33.190 --> 00:53:36.630
Stay tuned about 20 minutes, and
you will see not very natural

00:53:36.630 --> 00:53:38.350
at all.

00:53:38.350 --> 00:53:41.320
As soon as you get to humans,
all this social biology

00:53:41.320 --> 00:53:43.840
stuff with kin selection
is interesting, but as

00:53:43.840 --> 00:53:47.180
soon as you get to humans you
get to something vastly more

00:53:47.180 --> 00:53:48.970
interesting and important.

00:53:48.970 --> 00:53:52.380
Back to our recognizing
relatives realm--

00:53:52.380 --> 00:53:56.680
the business of how we interact
not with our relatives,

00:53:56.680 --> 00:54:00.430
but with people who we
feel as close to as if they

00:54:00.430 --> 00:54:03.900
are relatives-- pseudo kinship.

00:54:03.900 --> 00:54:06.890
And what you see in
culture after culture

00:54:06.890 --> 00:54:11.990
is brilliant manipulative skills
on the part of powers that

00:54:11.990 --> 00:54:16.080
be to make some non-relatives
feel more related to each other

00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:17.780
than they actually are.

00:54:17.780 --> 00:54:19.100
What's this about?

00:54:19.100 --> 00:54:21.860
This is military indoctrination.

00:54:21.860 --> 00:54:24.160
The whole point, or
one of the main points,

00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:27.000
of military training
early on is to get

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:30.400
people to become a
band of brothers,

00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:33.060
a band of pseudo
kinshipped relatives,

00:54:33.060 --> 00:54:36.360
to increase the
cooperativity later on,

00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:37.860
to increase the
odds that you are

00:54:37.860 --> 00:54:40.400
willing to give up your life
for the person next to you.

00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:43.060
Culture after culture
is great at doing this.

00:54:43.060 --> 00:54:46.540
Warrior cultures-- for example,
the Maasai in East Africa,

00:54:46.540 --> 00:54:48.840
they have a warrior
stage when you're 15,

00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:51.010
you go become a
warrior, roughly 15.

00:54:51.010 --> 00:54:52.840
And you stay that
way for a decade.

00:54:52.840 --> 00:54:54.170
And you protect the cows.

00:54:54.170 --> 00:54:55.300
And you raid the neighbors.

00:54:55.300 --> 00:54:57.680
And once you're 25,
you become an elder

00:54:57.680 --> 00:55:00.520
and get married then
to a 13-year-old.

00:55:00.520 --> 00:55:05.260
But what you've got there is
the entire structure of warrior

00:55:05.260 --> 00:55:07.880
life is built around
pseudo kinship.

00:55:07.880 --> 00:55:10.860
They live separately
from everybody else.

00:55:10.860 --> 00:55:13.870
They use kinship
terms for each other.

00:55:13.870 --> 00:55:16.440
For the rest of their
lives, their wife

00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:19.100
will refer to somebody
from their warrior class

00:55:19.100 --> 00:55:21.390
as her brother-in-law.

00:55:21.390 --> 00:55:24.450
Warriors are not allowed
to eat their own food.

00:55:24.450 --> 00:55:27.640
They can only share their
food with another warrior,

00:55:27.640 --> 00:55:31.440
all built around
generating pseudo kinship.

00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:34.850
Other version, that other
more industrialized version,

00:55:34.850 --> 00:55:37.310
the Israeli Military,
for example,

00:55:37.310 --> 00:55:40.680
allows kids when they are
signing up after high school

00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:44.740
to join particular units as
a group, a group of friends

00:55:44.740 --> 00:55:47.970
from their high school,
increasing the pseudo kinship

00:55:47.970 --> 00:55:49.790
element there.

00:55:49.790 --> 00:55:54.390
More of that-- something that
was absolutely unprecedented

00:55:54.390 --> 00:55:58.100
when you look at the difference
between kinship and pseudo

00:55:58.100 --> 00:55:58.870
kinship.

00:55:58.870 --> 00:56:03.630
World War II, United States
hugely heterogeneous country,

00:56:03.630 --> 00:56:06.850
obviously, blah, blah,
melting pot, all of that.

00:56:06.850 --> 00:56:10.710
And World War II was sort
of the peak of that picture.

00:56:10.710 --> 00:56:13.770
And what you got in
many, many fighting units

00:56:13.770 --> 00:56:16.100
was something straight
out of central casting

00:56:16.100 --> 00:56:17.820
in these inspirational movies.

00:56:17.820 --> 00:56:23.240
There's McCarthy from Boston,
and Sapiola from Philadelphia,

00:56:23.240 --> 00:56:26.700
and Kewalski from Chicago,
and then the Southern guy,

00:56:26.700 --> 00:56:28.540
and the Jewish guy
from who knows where.

00:56:28.540 --> 00:56:29.940
And they're all together.

00:56:29.940 --> 00:56:33.030
And they're a fighting
unit of American unity,

00:56:33.030 --> 00:56:33.930
and all of that.

00:56:33.930 --> 00:56:35.590
And what does that produce?

00:56:35.590 --> 00:56:39.040
Something that was virtually
unprecedented in warfare.

00:56:39.040 --> 00:56:41.990
If you were an American
soldier in World War II

00:56:41.990 --> 00:56:46.360
and you were of German-American
or German ancestry,

00:56:46.360 --> 00:56:48.740
you would, on the
average, almost certainly

00:56:48.740 --> 00:56:52.160
share more genes in common
with the people you were trying

00:56:52.160 --> 00:56:54.770
to kill than the people
you were willing to give up

00:56:54.770 --> 00:56:58.390
your life for, as you had
classically heterogeneous

00:56:58.390 --> 00:57:02.880
troops on the American side--
completely unprecedented,

00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:06.040
so this business
of pseudo kinship.

00:57:06.040 --> 00:57:08.080
Historically, Vietnam
was apparently

00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:12.570
a major failure of military
pseudo kinship mechanisms,

00:57:12.570 --> 00:57:15.490
in that something
unprecedented was done there,

00:57:15.490 --> 00:57:20.050
which was people were not
kept in stable fighting units.

00:57:20.050 --> 00:57:22.940
Instead, people were constantly
shuttling in and out.

00:57:22.940 --> 00:57:25.640
And you would get these nutty
circumstances, apparently,

00:57:25.640 --> 00:57:27.980
where you'd be there in the
middle of the firefight.

00:57:27.980 --> 00:57:31.220
And the person over here is some
kid who showed up this morning.

00:57:31.220 --> 00:57:33.070
And the guy here,
if he survives this,

00:57:33.070 --> 00:57:35.840
he's shipping out home
to Hawaii tonight.

00:57:35.840 --> 00:57:37.940
And who feels like a brother?

00:57:37.940 --> 00:57:38.890
No one.

00:57:38.890 --> 00:57:43.490
Vietnam had an unmatched degree
of breaking of unity of troops.

00:57:43.490 --> 00:57:44.960
Why was that done in Vietnam?

00:57:44.960 --> 00:57:46.600
Something that kept happening.

00:57:46.600 --> 00:57:49.930
As soon as they allowed
units to remain more stable,

00:57:49.930 --> 00:57:52.520
the rates at which soldiers
were shooting their officers

00:57:52.520 --> 00:57:54.910
would go way up.

00:57:54.910 --> 00:57:58.990
So another, perhaps,
version of cooperation.

00:57:58.990 --> 00:58:01.500
Hand-in-hand with
the pseudo kinship

00:58:01.500 --> 00:58:05.490
is, of course, the flip
side, pseudo speciation,

00:58:05.490 --> 00:58:08.650
the mechanisms, the
psychological, the propagandist

00:58:08.650 --> 00:58:12.950
mechanisms that are available
to make them seem as

00:58:12.950 --> 00:58:15.170
different from you as possible.

00:58:15.170 --> 00:58:17.540
Not just different
sorts of people,

00:58:17.540 --> 00:58:21.800
but pseudo speciation-- they
are so different they hardly

00:58:21.800 --> 00:58:23.890
even count as humans.

00:58:23.890 --> 00:58:26.300
It doesn't count as
much when you kill them.

00:58:26.300 --> 00:58:30.590
And endless realms of that
World War II propaganda

00:58:30.590 --> 00:58:33.450
in the United
States about various

00:58:33.450 --> 00:58:35.160
ethnicities that
we were fighting

00:58:35.160 --> 00:58:39.340
against pseudo speciating,
various genocides, the Rwandan

00:58:39.340 --> 00:58:39.840
one.

00:58:39.840 --> 00:58:44.450
The sort of call to arms there
was kill the cockroaches,

00:58:44.450 --> 00:58:47.700
kill the cockroaches, the
Hutu tribes killing the Tutsis

00:58:47.700 --> 00:58:48.270
there.

00:58:48.270 --> 00:58:50.970
And this was pseudo speciation.

00:58:50.970 --> 00:58:53.910
Let me give you an
amazing example which

00:58:53.910 --> 00:58:58.510
occurred in this country not
all that long ago around 1990.

00:58:58.510 --> 00:59:01.280
An astonishing piece
of pseudo speciation

00:59:01.280 --> 00:59:06.540
that happened in this
country-- 1990, first Gulf War.

00:59:06.540 --> 00:59:11.800
Kuwait was drilling oil from
underneath the Iraq's land.

00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:13.780
Iraq got pissed
off, invaded them.

00:59:13.780 --> 00:59:15.750
And, suddenly, we had
the first Gulf War.

00:59:15.750 --> 00:59:19.910
The United States goes in
there to drive the Iraqis out

00:59:19.910 --> 00:59:20.620
of Kuwait.

00:59:20.620 --> 00:59:22.280
And ultimately has
to make the decision

00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:25.300
of whether to follow them
into Iraq and overthrow

00:59:25.300 --> 00:59:26.350
Saddam Hussein.

00:59:26.350 --> 00:59:27.440
And that wasn't done.

00:59:27.440 --> 00:59:29.360
But so this war going on.

00:59:29.360 --> 00:59:31.950
Very early on, it
was absolutely clear

00:59:31.950 --> 00:59:37.250
where it was heading, which was
that the diplomacy was failing.

00:59:37.250 --> 00:59:38.830
And the United
States was beginning

00:59:38.830 --> 00:59:41.660
to pull together a coalition
of various countries

00:59:41.660 --> 00:59:44.270
that would be a unified
force fighting against Iraq.

00:59:44.270 --> 00:59:47.560
But it had not yet been
authorized by US Congress

00:59:47.560 --> 00:59:49.620
as an act of war.

00:59:49.620 --> 00:59:53.290
Suddenly, into
this came a woman,

00:59:53.290 --> 00:59:56.220
a refugee from Kuwait City.

00:59:56.220 --> 00:59:59.650
Refugee, she was a nurse who
worked in a hospital there.

00:59:59.650 --> 01:00:01.840
She had managed to
get out of Kuwait

01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:03.770
after the Iraqis had invaded.

01:00:03.770 --> 01:00:06.810
And she came and
testified in Congress

01:00:06.810 --> 01:00:10.120
about an appalling thing
that she had witnessed,

01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:13.580
which was when the Iraqis
came in and took over

01:00:13.580 --> 01:00:17.790
their hospital, not only did
they steal all the supplies.

01:00:17.790 --> 01:00:21.470
They took the newborn
infants out of the incubators

01:00:21.470 --> 01:00:24.830
and left them out to die, and
shipped the incubators back

01:00:24.830 --> 01:00:26.650
to Iraq.

01:00:26.650 --> 01:00:29.740
Everyone was
flabbergasted by this.

01:00:29.740 --> 01:00:33.490
This was every newspaper
in the country, everybody

01:00:33.490 --> 01:00:34.760
learned about this.

01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:39.440
Everybody suddenly learned,
my God, they leave babies out

01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:40.320
to die.

01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:43.160
These people hardly
count as human.

01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:46.740
And, critically, that war
was authorized by Congress

01:00:46.740 --> 01:00:49.060
by just a couple of
votes of senators.

01:00:49.060 --> 01:00:50.920
And at least a
half dozen of them

01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:54.320
cited this incident in helping
them decide and this was

01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:56.040
something that had to be done.

01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:59.810
This was a deciding factor
in us going to that war.

01:00:59.810 --> 01:01:04.060
And the remarkable thing
is, it never happened.

01:01:04.060 --> 01:01:07.340
The nurse was not a
nurse from Kuwait City.

01:01:07.340 --> 01:01:11.030
She was the niece of
the Kuwaiti ambassador

01:01:11.030 --> 01:01:12.810
to the United States.

01:01:12.810 --> 01:01:15.550
She had been trained
by a public relations

01:01:15.550 --> 01:01:18.050
firm paid for by
the US government

01:01:18.050 --> 01:01:19.700
to make up this story.

01:01:19.700 --> 01:01:23.070
And she sat in our
Congress on live TV

01:01:23.070 --> 01:01:26.360
in front of the entire
country, lied like crazy.

01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:30.980
And we went into that war
with a 92% approval rate-- one

01:01:30.980 --> 01:01:33.930
gigantic piece of
pseudo speciation.

01:01:33.930 --> 01:01:37.170
My God, they leave
babies out to die.

01:01:37.170 --> 01:01:39.490
It will hardly
count killing them.

01:01:39.490 --> 01:01:41.490
They're hardly even human.

01:01:41.490 --> 01:01:44.360
And the coverage of when it
was revealed what was actually

01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:47.930
going on with this person
didn't come anywhere close

01:01:47.930 --> 01:01:51.510
to front page in any newspaper
in the country, buried down

01:01:51.510 --> 01:01:52.230
in there.

01:01:52.230 --> 01:01:55.430
Virtually the entire country
came out of that incident

01:01:55.430 --> 01:01:58.840
having learned how
inhumane, those people

01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:01.010
hardly count as human.

01:02:01.010 --> 01:02:03.420
OK, five minute break.

01:02:03.420 --> 01:02:05.630
Our principles of
individual selection,

01:02:05.630 --> 01:02:08.280
kin selection,
reciprocal altruism,

01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:11.410
begin to give us insight into
circumstances where evolution

01:02:11.410 --> 01:02:13.710
should select for
more aggression,

01:02:13.710 --> 01:02:16.310
for more warfare
along those lines.

01:02:16.310 --> 01:02:19.470
Now, the flip side--
what is it in the realms

01:02:19.470 --> 01:02:21.750
of these basic building
blocks of evolution

01:02:21.750 --> 01:02:25.590
that will push for more
cooperation, more empathy, more

01:02:25.590 --> 01:02:27.810
affiliation, less violence?

01:02:27.810 --> 01:02:30.500
Individual selection
level-- we already

01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:32.260
know some of these
examples, which

01:02:32.260 --> 01:02:36.190
is that whole world of
alternative male strategies,

01:02:36.190 --> 01:02:39.780
that whole world of sometimes
if you're a male baboon,

01:02:39.780 --> 01:02:42.000
you could pass on lots
of copies of your genes

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.530
by fighting like mad
and being high ranking.

01:02:44.530 --> 01:02:47.550
And sometimes it's by
bypassing all of that

01:02:47.550 --> 01:02:51.180
and being the nice guy, having
an affiliative relationship,

01:02:51.180 --> 01:02:53.830
and female choice
being the thing that

01:02:53.830 --> 01:02:57.320
winds up increasing the number
of copies of your genes.

01:02:57.320 --> 01:03:01.180
So the possibilities of
alternative mating strategies,

01:03:01.180 --> 01:03:05.050
the possibilities of, of
course, parental behavior,

01:03:05.050 --> 01:03:07.310
and all we need to do
there is switch over

01:03:07.310 --> 01:03:10.140
to the world of South
American pair bonding monkeys.

01:03:10.140 --> 01:03:13.380
And those are not animals
with particularly high rates

01:03:13.380 --> 01:03:14.430
of aggression.

01:03:14.430 --> 01:03:16.290
So all of those
are circumstances

01:03:16.290 --> 01:03:19.770
where that could potentially
be perfectly genetically

01:03:19.770 --> 01:03:23.150
viable alternatives
to natural selection

01:03:23.150 --> 01:03:25.010
selects for higher
degrees of violence

01:03:25.010 --> 01:03:28.370
because it passes on more
copies of your genes.

01:03:28.370 --> 01:03:33.780
OK, kin selection-- so we've
just gone through kin selection

01:03:33.780 --> 01:03:37.490
insofar as it can
generate pseudo kinship

01:03:37.490 --> 01:03:40.090
and make you a better,
more murderous soldier

01:03:40.090 --> 01:03:42.070
who is more willing
to give up your life

01:03:42.070 --> 01:03:44.230
for your band of brothers.

01:03:44.230 --> 01:03:46.830
And conversely,
pseudo speciation,

01:03:46.830 --> 01:03:48.950
they hardly even
count as humans.

01:03:48.950 --> 01:03:52.890
The flip side, of course, ways
in which the human capacity

01:03:52.890 --> 01:03:56.860
for pseudo kinship can be
used to decrease violence,

01:03:56.860 --> 01:04:00.240
and to make things more
peaceable, and to make people

01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:02.660
feel more connected
with each other.

01:04:02.660 --> 01:04:05.350
This is a ritual in
all sorts of societies

01:04:05.350 --> 01:04:07.940
where you generate
pseudo kinship

01:04:07.940 --> 01:04:10.180
as a means of generating peace.

01:04:10.180 --> 01:04:14.200
One example, traditional Bedouin
society, here's what happens.

01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:16.770
You have two groups who have
been having tensions, who've

01:04:16.770 --> 01:04:19.440
been fighting, who have been
having some clan warfare,

01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:20.260
whatever.

01:04:20.260 --> 01:04:22.550
And they have now
figured out a way

01:04:22.550 --> 01:04:25.440
to have a treaty to stop
fighting with each other.

01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:28.170
Here is the ritual
that is done, which

01:04:28.170 --> 01:04:31.390
is a bunch of the old guys
from each of the groups come.

01:04:31.390 --> 01:04:32.490
And they sit down.

01:04:32.490 --> 01:04:36.020
And they start exploring
each other's genealogies.

01:04:36.020 --> 01:04:37.572
Who is your great grandparents?

01:04:37.572 --> 01:04:40.030
Who is your great, great, great,
going through all of that.

01:04:40.030 --> 01:04:42.700
And at some point, one
of them has the job

01:04:42.700 --> 01:04:46.460
of making up an imaginary
relationship between the two

01:04:46.460 --> 01:04:47.740
groups.

01:04:47.740 --> 01:04:49.510
Chuck, are you kidding?

01:04:49.510 --> 01:04:52.400
I had a great, great
grandfather named Chuck also.

01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:54.020
We're relatives.

01:04:54.020 --> 01:04:57.480
A ritual absolutely transparent
that people go through

01:04:57.480 --> 01:05:02.520
there to generate a supposed
rationale for relatedness,

01:05:02.520 --> 01:05:05.850
a big ceremony of
pseudo kinship.

01:05:05.850 --> 01:05:09.700
Another one is seen in some
aboriginal groups in Australia.

01:05:09.700 --> 01:05:12.520
Apparently, this is a
motif that pops up often

01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:14.780
in aboriginal rock art.

01:05:14.780 --> 01:05:19.000
And, apparently, it's a symbolic
version of this phenomenon.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.230
OK, you've got
somebody wandering

01:05:21.230 --> 01:05:23.750
through the great
back of beyond there.

01:05:23.750 --> 01:05:27.130
And there are very
few sources of water.

01:05:27.130 --> 01:05:28.960
There's a water hole up ahead.

01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:31.390
You've just walked 10
miles to come to it.

01:05:31.390 --> 01:05:34.080
And you suddenly
notice a stranger

01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:37.920
coming towards the water hole
from the opposite direction.

01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:42.300
And this is a water hole that
is essential for you to survive.

01:05:42.300 --> 01:05:44.570
You are not going to be able
to walk far enough to get

01:05:44.570 --> 01:05:46.000
to the next water hole.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.550
Maybe what you should
do, just in case

01:05:48.550 --> 01:05:50.460
this person winds
up being aggressive,

01:05:50.460 --> 01:05:53.990
is you should attack him
first-- a virtual guarantee

01:05:53.990 --> 01:05:55.060
of aggression.

01:05:55.060 --> 01:05:57.950
Here's a ritual that has
been worked out instead

01:05:57.950 --> 01:05:59.660
that bypasses it.

01:05:59.660 --> 01:06:02.660
The two individuals sit
down around the waterhole.

01:06:02.660 --> 01:06:06.140
And each starts giving
their genealogy.

01:06:06.140 --> 01:06:08.530
I am the son of, who's the
son of, who's the son of.

01:06:08.530 --> 01:06:10.560
Into the next bar
mitzvah, whatever.

01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:12.460
Oh, we're relatives.

01:06:12.460 --> 01:06:14.280
Let's share some water.

01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:15.900
They don't fall for
it for a second.

01:06:15.900 --> 01:06:19.250
But it is a totally artificial
mechanism of pseudo kinship

01:06:19.250 --> 01:06:21.660
to make it possible
for two strangers

01:06:21.660 --> 01:06:25.010
to share this absolutely
essential for life resource,

01:06:25.010 --> 01:06:27.530
and not try to kill each other.

01:06:27.530 --> 01:06:29.860
Same sort of thing,
pseudo kinship

01:06:29.860 --> 01:06:33.830
in all sorts of historical
examples, of revolutions.

01:06:33.830 --> 01:06:36.310
Revolutions generating
pseudo kinship,

01:06:36.310 --> 01:06:39.280
what is often the term
people use for each other

01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:40.920
after the revolution?

01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:45.190
Sisters, brothers unite,
pseudo kinship terms.

01:06:45.190 --> 01:06:50.300
In French, for example, there
is in the informal to tense.

01:06:50.300 --> 01:06:51.695
And there's the more formal one.

01:06:51.695 --> 01:06:54.540
And you're supposed to
use the more formal run

01:06:54.540 --> 01:06:55.810
sort of in the outside world.

01:06:55.810 --> 01:06:58.380
And in the aftermath of
the French Revolution,

01:06:58.380 --> 01:07:02.130
it became illegal to address
somebody, a stranger,

01:07:02.130 --> 01:07:03.630
in the formal tense.

01:07:03.630 --> 01:07:06.070
It always had to be
with the familial

01:07:06.070 --> 01:07:11.010
to tense there, pseudo
kinship, more and more of it.

01:07:11.010 --> 01:07:13.690
So this brings up
what is initially

01:07:13.690 --> 01:07:18.250
a really, really depressing
set of studies, which turn out

01:07:18.250 --> 01:07:22.010
to have a very nice optimistic
resolution to them--

01:07:22.010 --> 01:07:24.230
very disturbing work.

01:07:24.230 --> 01:07:26.850
Work done by a number
of labs over the years

01:07:26.850 --> 01:07:32.340
most notably, Elizabeth
Phelps, who is at NYU.

01:07:32.340 --> 01:07:35.300
And this is work using
functional brain imaging,

01:07:35.300 --> 01:07:36.600
amygdala, all of that.

01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:39.300
You put people in
a brain scanner.

01:07:39.300 --> 01:07:40.690
Actually you put one in.

01:07:40.690 --> 01:07:42.420
And you put them
in one at a time.

01:07:42.420 --> 01:07:46.570
And what you do is you're
flashing up pictures to them,

01:07:46.570 --> 01:07:49.980
flashing up pictures
of people, of faces,

01:07:49.980 --> 01:07:52.200
of faces at a rapid speed.

01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:54.860
So there's virtually no
conscious processing.

01:07:54.860 --> 01:07:57.620
This is all tapping
into subliminal stuff.

01:07:57.620 --> 01:08:00.870
And what she reported, and
what has been replicated

01:08:00.870 --> 01:08:03.780
by a number of other
groups since then,

01:08:03.780 --> 01:08:08.010
is that you get
activation of the amygdala

01:08:08.010 --> 01:08:10.470
on the average in people
when you subliminally

01:08:10.470 --> 01:08:15.720
flash up pictures of
somebody of another race.

01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:20.149
Whoa, shit, that is
distressing to have been found.

01:08:20.149 --> 01:08:22.920
That is not a good
thing, because this

01:08:22.920 --> 01:08:27.290
is totally rapid subliminal
stuff, and replicated,

01:08:27.290 --> 01:08:29.830
some of the best people
in the field showing this.

01:08:29.830 --> 01:08:33.290
My God, the amygdala
has an us/them

01:08:33.290 --> 01:08:35.229
that's, in effect,
there in a quarter

01:08:35.229 --> 01:08:37.060
second after seeing something.

01:08:37.060 --> 01:08:38.510
This is hopeless.

01:08:38.510 --> 01:08:40.660
We are so dichotomized.

01:08:40.660 --> 01:08:43.060
This is a disaster.

01:08:43.060 --> 01:08:46.270
In the years since then,
much more interesting stuff

01:08:46.270 --> 01:08:47.010
has emerged.

01:08:47.010 --> 01:08:48.930
And this has predominately
been research

01:08:48.930 --> 01:08:53.160
by Susan Fiske at Princeton
showing that it doesn't

01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:55.420
necessarily work this way.

01:08:55.420 --> 01:08:58.090
OK, here's what you do.

01:08:58.090 --> 01:09:00.520
First version,
you tell somebody,

01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:02.100
I'm going to be
flashing up pictures

01:09:02.100 --> 01:09:05.319
of faces while you're lying
there in the brain scanner.

01:09:05.319 --> 01:09:07.790
And what you do
is you force them

01:09:07.790 --> 01:09:10.859
to look at the picture in
a way where in a purely

01:09:10.859 --> 01:09:14.020
mechanical visual viewing,
you're going to say,

01:09:14.020 --> 01:09:17.177
some of the pictures
have a big red dot

01:09:17.177 --> 01:09:18.260
right in the middle of it.

01:09:18.260 --> 01:09:19.718
And any time one
of those comes up,

01:09:19.718 --> 01:09:21.490
I want you to press this button.

01:09:21.490 --> 01:09:24.580
In other words, just
process the picture

01:09:24.580 --> 01:09:27.060
for just a visual pattern.

01:09:27.060 --> 01:09:27.990
You do that.

01:09:27.990 --> 01:09:29.750
And the amygdala
doesn't activate

01:09:29.750 --> 01:09:32.160
when you see a picture of
somebody of another race.

01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:34.620
OK, this is not very exciting.

01:09:34.620 --> 01:09:37.390
Now, the next thing
she would do--

01:09:37.390 --> 01:09:41.090
get people to start
thinking categorically.

01:09:41.090 --> 01:09:41.939
Here's what you do.

01:09:41.939 --> 01:09:43.939
She would now have people
going in there saying,

01:09:43.939 --> 01:09:46.605
I'm going to give you a bunch of
pictures, flashing up pictures.

01:09:46.605 --> 01:09:49.653
And what I want you
to do is to stop.

01:09:49.653 --> 01:09:51.069
I'm going to stop
at some of them.

01:09:51.069 --> 01:09:52.520
And I want you to look closely.

01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:56.020
And tell me, do you think
this person is older than age

01:09:56.020 --> 01:09:59.030
30 or younger than age 30?

01:09:59.030 --> 01:10:02.710
In other words, what you have
just requested the person to do

01:10:02.710 --> 01:10:04.570
is think of the
face in the picture

01:10:04.570 --> 01:10:09.542
as belonging to a category,
rather than as an individual.

01:10:09.542 --> 01:10:11.250
You're going to look
at this picture now.

01:10:11.250 --> 01:10:13.450
And you don't really need
to care who the person is,

01:10:13.450 --> 01:10:15.090
or what they look
like, or anything.

01:10:15.090 --> 01:10:18.900
All you need to do is think
of them as part of a category.

01:10:18.900 --> 01:10:20.740
And when you bias
people like that,

01:10:20.740 --> 01:10:23.810
and you flash up the picture
of somebody from another race,

01:10:23.810 --> 01:10:26.330
the amygdala gets
even more activated.

01:10:26.330 --> 01:10:30.450
You have primed somebody to
think not about individuals,

01:10:30.450 --> 01:10:33.930
but to make them think
of people in categories.

01:10:33.930 --> 01:10:37.790
Finally, what she shows
is exactly the opposite.

01:10:37.790 --> 01:10:40.160
Now what she does
is prime something,

01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:42.640
a totally neutral
sort of priming,

01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:46.010
to try to get people to think
of the person in the picture

01:10:46.010 --> 01:10:47.660
as an individual.

01:10:47.660 --> 01:10:51.550
And she asks totally
innocuous, neutral things

01:10:51.550 --> 01:10:53.910
along the lines of, I want
you to look at the picture.

01:10:53.910 --> 01:10:54.952
I know this sounds silly.

01:10:54.952 --> 01:10:56.534
But I want you to
look at the picture.

01:10:56.534 --> 01:10:58.930
And tell me, do you think is
this the kind of person who

01:10:58.930 --> 01:11:02.300
likes Coke or Pepsi?

01:11:02.300 --> 01:11:04.490
Totally sort of
diagonal orthogonal

01:11:04.490 --> 01:11:07.320
to all of this stuff,
get someone doing that.

01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:11.770
And now the amygdala
doesn't activate.

01:11:11.770 --> 01:11:17.110
All you need to do in that study
is subliminally prime someone

01:11:17.110 --> 01:11:19.450
to think of someone who
they're about to look

01:11:19.450 --> 01:11:23.630
at as an individual, rather
than as part of a category,

01:11:23.630 --> 01:11:25.280
than as part of a group.

01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:29.860
This is not rebuilding society
so that we change our us/thems.

01:11:29.860 --> 01:11:33.580
This is a minor prompt 30
seconds before somebody has

01:11:33.580 --> 01:11:35.130
the pictures flashed at them.

01:11:35.130 --> 01:11:38.270
That's all it took
in these studies.

01:11:38.270 --> 01:11:41.780
More good news emerged,
which was that you would also

01:11:41.780 --> 01:11:44.440
see separate of these
sorts of manipulations,

01:11:44.440 --> 01:11:47.970
long-term developmental
aspects that were predictors

01:11:47.970 --> 01:11:49.130
of this phenomenon.

01:11:49.130 --> 01:11:53.060
People who grew up in racially
and ethnically diverse

01:11:53.060 --> 01:11:56.640
neighborhoods didn't have
this amygdala effect.

01:11:56.640 --> 01:11:59.360
People who had had a
significant relationship

01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:02.500
with a significant
other of another race

01:12:02.500 --> 01:12:05.450
did not have this
amygdala reaction there.

01:12:05.450 --> 01:12:09.200
So the easy solution to
this being depressing--

01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:14.200
OK, early childhood, exposure
throughout life, that's great.

01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:15.520
That's very good news.

01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:19.470
But even more remarkable in
her studies is just a prompt.

01:12:19.470 --> 01:12:23.290
Prompt somebody to think of
that person as an individual.

01:12:23.290 --> 01:12:28.300
And your amygdala is not doing
an us/them with them anymore.

01:12:28.300 --> 01:12:31.160
Now, this whole business
about if you grew up

01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:35.070
in a diverse neighborhood,
that taps into a whole field

01:12:35.070 --> 01:12:37.100
called contact theory.

01:12:37.100 --> 01:12:39.460
The notion that
aggression is decreased,

01:12:39.460 --> 01:12:43.090
affiliation is increased,
if people have grown up

01:12:43.090 --> 01:12:46.850
with lots of contact with
people from other cultures,

01:12:46.850 --> 01:12:50.010
other societies other
religions, all of that,

01:12:50.010 --> 01:12:53.430
or if people live
in contact with it.

01:12:53.430 --> 01:12:56.780
And, in general, what this
large literature shows is

01:12:56.780 --> 01:12:58.280
it does work that way.

01:12:58.280 --> 01:13:01.950
Contact theory, growing up
in diverse neighborhoods,

01:13:01.950 --> 01:13:03.940
growing up in
diverse communities,

01:13:03.940 --> 01:13:07.310
increases the likelihood
of a broader umbrella

01:13:07.310 --> 01:13:10.490
of what counts as an us.

01:13:10.490 --> 01:13:11.440
That's good.

01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:13.160
Where does it not work?

01:13:13.160 --> 01:13:16.060
One realm where most of
the studies have shown this

01:13:16.060 --> 01:13:18.710
is a realm that's
totally heartwarming.

01:13:18.710 --> 01:13:20.560
And it would be
great if it did work.

01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:23.010
But most of the studies
show that it doesn't.

01:13:23.010 --> 01:13:25.660
These are the circumstances
where somebody puts up

01:13:25.660 --> 01:13:29.650
the money to take some really
poor Irish Catholic kids

01:13:29.650 --> 01:13:34.210
in Belfast, and some really poor
Irish Protestant kids in there

01:13:34.210 --> 01:13:36.570
during the worst of
the civil unrest there.

01:13:36.570 --> 01:13:39.820
And they get to go to someplace
wonderful and far away.

01:13:39.820 --> 01:13:42.730
And they all go to
summer camp together.

01:13:42.730 --> 01:13:45.220
And they have teams that
are mixtures of the kids

01:13:45.220 --> 01:13:46.340
by different religions.

01:13:46.340 --> 01:13:47.480
And they're growing.

01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:50.390
They're growing to recognize
each other as individuals.

01:13:50.390 --> 01:13:53.010
Or the versions, lots of
which have been tried,

01:13:53.010 --> 01:13:58.030
of sort of retreats or even
camps of Palestinian teenagers,

01:13:58.030 --> 01:13:59.560
Israeli teenagers.

01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:01.210
These are the leaders
in the future.

01:14:01.210 --> 01:14:03.860
They will go back and
have learned they're not

01:14:03.860 --> 01:14:05.340
so different after all.

01:14:05.340 --> 01:14:07.220
They're kind of just like us.

01:14:07.220 --> 01:14:09.030
What those studies
have generally shown

01:14:09.030 --> 01:14:10.720
is that doesn't work.

01:14:10.720 --> 01:14:12.650
It works for only
a little while.

01:14:12.650 --> 01:14:16.130
You can't just pull it off
on a two-week camping trip.

01:14:16.130 --> 01:14:18.420
It takes more
sustained exposure.

01:14:18.420 --> 01:14:23.620
It basically requires growing
up in, or living sustainedly in.

01:14:23.620 --> 01:14:25.630
So that's been a disappointment.

01:14:25.630 --> 01:14:28.280
One additional disappointment
with the contact theory

01:14:28.280 --> 01:14:38.510
literature, which is one of the
papers, which again I think I

01:14:38.510 --> 01:14:39.770
put in the suggested reading.

01:14:39.770 --> 01:14:41.830
OK, so you've got
two different groups,

01:14:41.830 --> 01:14:44.240
two different populations,
two different ethnicities,

01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:45.160
whatever.

01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:48.440
And they are living in
generally the same area,

01:14:48.440 --> 01:14:52.650
but nonetheless segregated
within group in smaller areas.

01:14:52.650 --> 01:14:57.270
One scenario-- here's the region
where these two groups live.

01:14:57.270 --> 01:15:00.650
And there's an absolute
boundary between them.

01:15:00.650 --> 01:15:04.450
Here, instead, there's sort
of an undulating boundary.

01:15:04.450 --> 01:15:05.630
It's less clear.

01:15:05.630 --> 01:15:09.240
And, critically, there
is more surface area.

01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:12.860
There is more interfaces
between the two groups.

01:15:12.860 --> 01:15:16.320
There's more domains
of experiencing people

01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:17.840
from the other group.

01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:20.810
Finally, versions
where instead you

01:15:20.810 --> 01:15:24.350
have pockets of different
groups embedded in other ones.

01:15:24.350 --> 01:15:27.120
And that being a completely
different scenario

01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:31.770
where, in fact, you maximize the
perimeter that you get there.

01:15:31.770 --> 01:15:33.450
And what's been shown
in this one study

01:15:33.450 --> 01:15:37.320
that I recommended that you
guys look at is the more

01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:40.450
contact, the more
interfaces, between the two

01:15:40.450 --> 01:15:44.380
groups and living situations
doesn't guarantee that people

01:15:44.380 --> 01:15:45.830
will get along better.

01:15:45.830 --> 01:15:48.790
What you will find is there's
intermediate points where

01:15:48.790 --> 01:15:52.390
the contact profile
increases aggression,

01:15:52.390 --> 01:15:55.100
because what it does
is you just barely

01:15:55.100 --> 01:15:59.100
have a critical mass
of people on your side

01:15:59.100 --> 01:16:02.510
to be an effective group
to fight with them.

01:16:02.510 --> 01:16:04.390
You see totally
different outcomes,

01:16:04.390 --> 01:16:06.980
depending on the
spatial characteristics

01:16:06.980 --> 01:16:07.930
of the subgrouping.

01:16:07.930 --> 01:16:09.890
And what the people
showed in this paper was

01:16:09.890 --> 01:16:13.120
they then analyzed the
different ethnic distributions

01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:17.190
in the Balkans, the Bosnian
War, the Croatians, all of that,

01:16:17.190 --> 01:16:20.740
and seeing that this was
extremely predictive of where

01:16:20.740 --> 01:16:24.500
the violence took place in
terms of where you had what they

01:16:24.500 --> 01:16:29.000
viewed as the least optimal
set of interfaces of contact

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:30.010
between groups.

01:16:30.010 --> 01:16:33.120
More contact is not
necessarily always equal,

01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:35.750
more understanding and
we're all just the same.

01:16:35.750 --> 01:16:39.790
More contact can equal, in
some cases, more irritation,

01:16:39.790 --> 01:16:44.710
and more resources, and more
unity to do something about it.

01:16:44.710 --> 01:16:49.650
OK, more of pseudo kinship--
so this whole notion, again,

01:16:49.650 --> 01:16:52.190
of pseudo kinship,
we are species

01:16:52.190 --> 01:16:53.900
where we're not
recognizing individuals

01:16:53.900 --> 01:16:55.260
by smell, all of that.

01:16:55.260 --> 01:16:57.252
We're doing that
cognition stuff.

01:16:57.252 --> 01:16:58.960
But don't forget the
[? kibbutz ?] study.

01:16:58.960 --> 01:17:00.800
But we're doing that
cognition stuff.

01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:03.080
And, thus, we can
do pseudo kinship.

01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:05.550
And, thus, we could
be manipulated

01:17:05.550 --> 01:17:09.390
by powers that be, by
governments, by religions,

01:17:09.390 --> 01:17:12.700
and to viewing non-relatives
as more related to us,

01:17:12.700 --> 01:17:13.500
and all of that.

01:17:13.500 --> 01:17:16.680
These are very
abstract processes.

01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:20.470
And it brings up another realm,
an extremely abstract realm,

01:17:20.470 --> 01:17:24.614
that pushes for more
cooperation and less violence.

01:17:24.614 --> 01:17:26.280
And this goes back
to what I was talking

01:17:26.280 --> 01:17:29.630
about the other day, the
neurobiology of symbols,

01:17:29.630 --> 01:17:32.180
how we code for certain
types of symbols,

01:17:32.180 --> 01:17:33.870
certain metaphors in our brain.

01:17:33.870 --> 01:17:35.550
And that's back to
that whole world

01:17:35.550 --> 01:17:37.940
of, you're using the
same part of the brain

01:17:37.940 --> 01:17:41.650
for disgusting food and
moral disgust, warm drink,

01:17:41.650 --> 01:17:45.282
warm personality, that
weird concrete literalness.

01:17:45.282 --> 01:17:47.240
Because you've got a
pretty metaphors somewhere

01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:49.310
when humans started
developing them,

01:17:49.310 --> 01:17:51.520
the outcome of that
being that metaphors

01:17:51.520 --> 01:17:54.750
can be extraordinarily powerful.

01:17:54.750 --> 01:17:56.500
And a number of
researchers-- probably

01:17:56.500 --> 01:17:59.320
the person most visible in
this realm, an economist

01:17:59.320 --> 01:18:01.780
University of Michigan
named Robert Axelrod

01:18:01.780 --> 01:18:04.770
as doing a whole lot of
work showing, in a sense,

01:18:04.770 --> 01:18:08.040
the importance of
symbols in peacemaking.

01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:10.020
And it makes perfect sense.

01:18:10.020 --> 01:18:13.060
You take the extreme
rationalist view

01:18:13.060 --> 01:18:15.490
of humans as economic machines.

01:18:15.490 --> 01:18:18.250
And what peacemaking is
going to be purely about

01:18:18.250 --> 01:18:21.300
is figuring out
contested resources

01:18:21.300 --> 01:18:23.780
and how they are going
to be divided up.

01:18:23.780 --> 01:18:25.620
And what Axelrod
and others show,

01:18:25.620 --> 01:18:29.700
instead, is this whole
irrational realm of,

01:18:29.700 --> 01:18:33.520
be respectful of
somebody else's symbols.

01:18:33.520 --> 01:18:36.700
And figuring out how you're
going to divide up the land

01:18:36.700 --> 01:18:39.070
suddenly becomes a
lot less important--

01:18:39.070 --> 01:18:43.590
the power of symbols over
rational contested resources.

01:18:43.590 --> 01:18:47.040
And he studied things like
how a critical thing that

01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:50.280
happened in peace coming
to Northern Ireland

01:18:50.280 --> 01:18:54.580
was at one juncture a bunch
of the Sinn Fein, however

01:18:54.580 --> 01:18:58.510
that's pronounced, the
ex-military wing of the IRA

01:18:58.510 --> 01:19:01.500
that were just beginning
to have extremely

01:19:01.500 --> 01:19:06.180
mistrustful negotiations with
some of the Protestant unions

01:19:06.180 --> 01:19:06.900
and all of that.

01:19:06.900 --> 01:19:09.210
They did something outrageous.

01:19:09.210 --> 01:19:12.100
They sent a 50th
wedding anniversary gift

01:19:12.100 --> 01:19:16.180
to this guy Ian Paisley,
who was the murderous head

01:19:16.180 --> 01:19:18.950
of the Protestant
death squads there.

01:19:18.950 --> 01:19:21.400
Somebody just
decided to try this.

01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:24.590
And this was a
massive breakthrough.

01:19:24.590 --> 01:19:27.830
Anyone who saw that movie
Invictus or have read about,

01:19:27.830 --> 01:19:30.140
the utter brilliance
of Nelson Mandela,

01:19:30.140 --> 01:19:32.920
of having spent his
time in prison learning

01:19:32.920 --> 01:19:35.650
to be completely
fluent in Afrikaans

01:19:35.650 --> 01:19:39.180
so that when he was sitting
down and starting to negotiate

01:19:39.180 --> 01:19:42.690
with these people, the fact that
he could sit there and speak

01:19:42.690 --> 01:19:44.480
in their language,
a language that

01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:47.390
is so laden with
symbolic importance

01:19:47.390 --> 01:19:51.710
to Afrikaners, that that
was a gigantic symbolic coup

01:19:51.710 --> 01:19:53.970
of Mandela embracing
the sport that

01:19:53.970 --> 01:19:57.220
was the very symbol of
apartheid, of Mandela doing

01:19:57.220 --> 01:19:59.800
very subtle things
that a number of people

01:19:59.800 --> 01:20:02.270
pointed out who were
involved in the negotiations.

01:20:02.270 --> 01:20:05.330
OK, Mandela, just when
he's gotten out of prison,

01:20:05.330 --> 01:20:07.550
and he's about to meet
with some of the leaders

01:20:07.550 --> 01:20:10.170
of the government, and some of
the most right wing opponents

01:20:10.170 --> 01:20:11.290
to any sort of peace.

01:20:11.290 --> 01:20:13.300
And so we need a
conference room.

01:20:13.300 --> 01:20:15.090
And, no, that's not what he did.

01:20:15.090 --> 01:20:19.170
He insisted they would have the
meetings in his home, his home

01:20:19.170 --> 01:20:21.040
that he had just returned to.

01:20:21.040 --> 01:20:24.110
OK, well let's clear off
the dining room table.

01:20:24.110 --> 01:20:26.190
No, that's not what he did.

01:20:26.190 --> 01:20:29.440
He would insist they did this
in the living room, where

01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:33.180
they would sit down on
stuffed armchairs and couches.

01:20:33.180 --> 01:20:36.180
And something that he did,
apparently, always at these

01:20:36.180 --> 01:20:40.050
is he would sit down on the
couch, and gesture to whoever

01:20:40.050 --> 01:20:43.275
was likely to be the
most impossible foe,

01:20:43.275 --> 01:20:44.730
and say, come sit next to me.

01:20:44.730 --> 01:20:46.340
Sit next to me on the couch.

01:20:46.340 --> 01:20:49.890
And would proceed to jump
up at various points to say,

01:20:49.890 --> 01:20:51.580
can I get you some more tea?

01:20:51.580 --> 01:20:53.720
Do you want some more--
there would be food.

01:20:53.720 --> 01:20:54.790
There would be biscuits.

01:20:54.790 --> 01:20:58.010
There would be whatever--
brilliant, brilliant use

01:20:58.010 --> 01:20:59.090
of symbols.

01:20:59.090 --> 01:21:00.700
If I'm sitting
here, and this guy

01:21:00.700 --> 01:21:03.920
keeps jumping up and getting
me more cookies just when I

01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:06.530
was getting a hankering
for some more cookies,

01:21:06.530 --> 01:21:09.150
maybe not so
different after all.

01:21:09.150 --> 01:21:12.160
People who get cookies
for other people

01:21:12.160 --> 01:21:15.410
make the world more peaceful,
or something or other.

01:21:15.410 --> 01:21:17.610
What Axelrod has also
shown in some of his work

01:21:17.610 --> 01:21:20.910
is the potential for it--
really interesting stuff.

01:21:20.910 --> 01:21:23.960
He will, for example, he
and people working with him,

01:21:23.960 --> 01:21:28.390
have interviewed, say, Hamas
leaders in Palestinian,

01:21:28.390 --> 01:21:32.710
and the Gaza, and the West
Bank, some of the most

01:21:32.710 --> 01:21:36.380
opposed to the existence of
Israel, most confrontational

01:21:36.380 --> 01:21:36.880
of groups.

01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:40.660
And he gets quotes from their
leaders along the lines of,

01:21:40.660 --> 01:21:43.840
if the Israelis would
ever once just say,

01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:46.390
we got screwed in 1948.

01:21:46.390 --> 01:21:48.120
And we're sorry it happened.

01:21:48.120 --> 01:21:50.290
We would be willing
to make peace.

01:21:50.290 --> 01:21:53.412
And then he goes and talks
to some Israeli generals

01:21:53.412 --> 01:21:55.120
who are some of the
most right wing ones.

01:21:55.120 --> 01:21:56.240
He selects them for that.

01:21:56.240 --> 01:21:57.310
And they sit there.

01:21:57.310 --> 01:22:01.150
And they say stuff like, if the
damn Palestinians would ever

01:22:01.150 --> 01:22:04.380
just get the anti-Semitic
garbage out of their school

01:22:04.380 --> 01:22:07.430
books, we'd be able to
think seriously about peace

01:22:07.430 --> 01:22:08.320
the next day.

01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:10.260
It's not about water rights.

01:22:10.260 --> 01:22:12.690
It's not about return of land.

01:22:12.690 --> 01:22:15.510
It's just about, are
they going to respect

01:22:15.510 --> 01:22:18.880
our symbols and the
legitimacy of our history,

01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:20.640
and the accuracy of it?

01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:25.490
Enormously, potentially
powerful interventions there.

01:22:25.490 --> 01:22:30.730
OK, so kin selection-- most
importantly, pseudo kinship.

01:22:30.730 --> 01:22:33.260
Moving on now--
reciprocal altruism.

01:22:33.260 --> 01:22:36.490
Where does that come in, in
terms of potentially making

01:22:36.490 --> 01:22:37.520
for more peace?

01:22:37.520 --> 01:22:39.660
And what's clear
is, in principle,

01:22:39.660 --> 01:22:43.320
it should never do it if you
are playing only a single round

01:22:43.320 --> 01:22:45.810
of a game with someone, a
game in the prisoner's dilemma

01:22:45.810 --> 01:22:49.850
sense, because there's
absolutely no reason

01:22:49.850 --> 01:22:52.390
to cooperate,
because you are never

01:22:52.390 --> 01:22:54.190
going to face the person again.

01:22:54.190 --> 01:22:56.840
And this is something that was
called by a zoologist Garret

01:22:56.840 --> 01:22:59.790
Hardin the tragedy
of the commons,

01:22:59.790 --> 01:23:02.660
and the circumstance
of shared resources

01:23:02.660 --> 01:23:07.160
but limited responsibility, and
limited repeated interactions.

01:23:07.160 --> 01:23:09.510
You have to select
for selfishness.

01:23:09.510 --> 01:23:13.180
You have to select for what
is termed a Nash equilibrium,

01:23:13.180 --> 01:23:15.520
where the only possible
rational thing to do

01:23:15.520 --> 01:23:17.910
there is to not cooperate.

01:23:17.910 --> 01:23:20.580
So how do you ever
get cooperation

01:23:20.580 --> 01:23:24.270
to evolve in groups
of organisms?

01:23:24.270 --> 01:23:28.450
So back to the same Axelrod,
his work with computer

01:23:28.450 --> 01:23:30.290
tournaments there,
with a tit for tat,

01:23:30.290 --> 01:23:33.070
seeing that under some
circumstances one of them

01:23:33.070 --> 01:23:33.880
can dominate.

01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:35.610
Tit for tat is a
great optimal one.

01:23:35.610 --> 01:23:37.700
In the real world,
though, how do you ever

01:23:37.700 --> 01:23:40.230
jump start cooperation?

01:23:40.230 --> 01:23:43.100
How do you ever get one
of those strategies going

01:23:43.100 --> 01:23:46.650
when the starting state is
complete lack of cooperation?

01:23:46.650 --> 01:23:50.210
We already know one example,
which is founder populations,

01:23:50.210 --> 01:23:53.770
that whole business about get
an isolated population has

01:23:53.770 --> 01:23:57.340
a higher coefficient
of relatedness, inbred,

01:23:57.340 --> 01:23:58.800
out of kin selection.

01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:00.790
Establish high degrees
of cooperation.

01:24:00.790 --> 01:24:01.670
They come back.

01:24:01.670 --> 01:24:05.405
And it's this group
selection phenomenon of,

01:24:05.405 --> 01:24:07.570
you better become as
cooperative as them.

01:24:07.570 --> 01:24:10.240
Or you're not going
to be able to compete.

01:24:10.240 --> 01:24:12.090
And you could see
the same exact thing

01:24:12.090 --> 01:24:15.030
in circumstances where
it is not a founder

01:24:15.030 --> 01:24:17.250
effect of a population
goes away for a while

01:24:17.250 --> 01:24:20.590
and then comes back, but where
a population is functioning

01:24:20.590 --> 01:24:24.490
in that way amid a sea
of non-cooperators.

01:24:24.490 --> 01:24:27.280
In New York City
in the 1980s, there

01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:29.760
was this totally
weird phenomenon

01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:32.600
in that there were
two ethnic groups that

01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:35.250
were moving into New York
at a much higher rate

01:24:35.250 --> 01:24:37.250
than in the past--
Korean immigrants

01:24:37.250 --> 01:24:38.470
and Lebanese immigrants.

01:24:38.470 --> 01:24:41.450
And both groups happened to
gravitate towards grocery

01:24:41.450 --> 01:24:45.320
stores-- the Korean community
fruit, vegetable stands,

01:24:45.320 --> 01:24:48.570
the Lebanese community more
regular old grocery stores.

01:24:48.570 --> 01:24:51.890
And they were
incredibly successful.

01:24:51.890 --> 01:24:54.480
And these popped up
all over the place.

01:24:54.480 --> 01:24:58.080
And the people who already
had the fruit and vegetable

01:24:58.080 --> 01:25:01.020
stands and stuff started
complaining that they

01:25:01.020 --> 01:25:03.420
were at an unfair disadvantage.

01:25:03.420 --> 01:25:04.220
How come?

01:25:04.220 --> 01:25:07.670
Because these Korean
shop owners would

01:25:07.670 --> 01:25:09.230
cooperate with each other.

01:25:09.230 --> 01:25:12.070
They would give each
other interest-free loans.

01:25:12.070 --> 01:25:14.150
That's not fair.

01:25:14.150 --> 01:25:16.690
That's not fair that they're
being nice to each other.

01:25:16.690 --> 01:25:18.190
We can't compete.

01:25:18.190 --> 01:25:20.970
And the same thing with the
Lebanese grocery owners,

01:25:20.970 --> 01:25:23.990
that you had people
doing reciprocal altruism

01:25:23.990 --> 01:25:25.400
in a community of trust.

01:25:25.400 --> 01:25:27.150
And what they were
immediately doing

01:25:27.150 --> 01:25:30.360
was out competing
the non-cooperators.

01:25:30.360 --> 01:25:35.190
And amid these bizarre demands
for, like, banning Korean fruit

01:25:35.190 --> 01:25:37.560
and vegetable stands,
or some-- like,

01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:39.860
this was a point
of great hostility

01:25:39.860 --> 01:25:41.630
during that period
in New York City

01:25:41.630 --> 01:25:43.950
because those people
were cheating.

01:25:43.950 --> 01:25:45.980
They cooperated with each other.

01:25:45.980 --> 01:25:47.810
So either join in.

01:25:47.810 --> 01:25:50.770
Or you will be
driven to extinction.

01:25:50.770 --> 01:25:52.350
So that is one possibility.

01:25:52.350 --> 01:25:55.760
What are the other circumstances
in formal game theory

01:25:55.760 --> 01:26:00.000
play that favors the
emergence of cooperation?

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:03.160
Critical one--
repetition, that you're

01:26:03.160 --> 01:26:07.380
going to play against this
individual more than just once.

01:26:07.380 --> 01:26:10.270
If it's run time, it's
tragedy of the commons.

01:26:10.270 --> 01:26:16.400
There is absolutely no reason
to select for cooperation.

01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:19.710
Repeated interactions,
and it opens up

01:26:19.710 --> 01:26:22.590
the possibility of
you being punished

01:26:22.590 --> 01:26:25.180
for being a cheater,
what they call

01:26:25.180 --> 01:26:29.810
the shadow of
future retribution.

01:26:29.810 --> 01:26:32.340
One qualifier with
that, though-- you

01:26:32.340 --> 01:26:34.940
need to have multiple
rounds of interactions.

01:26:34.940 --> 01:26:38.650
But it can't be a
known number of rounds.

01:26:38.650 --> 01:26:41.740
You can't know how many
rounds it's going to be.

01:26:41.740 --> 01:26:43.480
Think through this.

01:26:43.480 --> 01:26:46.540
You know that this is
the very last round

01:26:46.540 --> 01:26:48.010
you are going to play.

01:26:48.010 --> 01:26:51.230
And what's the only logical
thing to do is to cheat?

01:26:51.230 --> 01:26:53.360
The very last round
functions as if it

01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:56.960
was a tragedy of the commons
single game, single round game.

01:26:56.960 --> 01:26:58.610
So the only logical
thing to do is

01:26:58.610 --> 01:27:00.740
to cheat in the very last round.

01:27:00.740 --> 01:27:03.050
In which case, the only
logical thing to do

01:27:03.050 --> 01:27:05.190
is to cheat in the
next to the last round,

01:27:05.190 --> 01:27:06.310
and the next to the last.

01:27:06.310 --> 01:27:09.540
A known number of
rounds of interactions

01:27:09.540 --> 01:27:12.610
immediately does in
cooperation because it sort of

01:27:12.610 --> 01:27:17.320
flows backwards with this
collapse of the system.

01:27:17.320 --> 01:27:20.460
The next thing that favors it
is what is called open book

01:27:20.460 --> 01:27:23.210
play by people in the
business, which is you

01:27:23.210 --> 01:27:26.730
will be playing against a
number of different individuals,

01:27:26.730 --> 01:27:29.840
and pairs, cycling through.

01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:31.320
And the critical
thing is when you

01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:34.030
begin to play with
someone else, they

01:27:34.030 --> 01:27:38.590
can know your record as to how
you played in previous games.

01:27:38.590 --> 01:27:42.230
In other words, once
you bring in reputation,

01:27:42.230 --> 01:27:45.750
when reputation can be
possible, suddenly you

01:27:45.750 --> 01:27:48.640
select for cooperation.

01:27:48.640 --> 01:27:53.280
Next, what's shown is that
if you have people playing

01:27:53.280 --> 01:27:55.250
in multiple games
with each other,

01:27:55.250 --> 01:27:57.190
especially when
they're unsynchronized,

01:27:57.190 --> 01:27:59.610
you select for
cooperation as well.

01:27:59.610 --> 01:28:00.930
What's this about?

01:28:00.930 --> 01:28:04.580
What you do is if one of
the games makes it very,

01:28:04.580 --> 01:28:07.670
very easy in terms of
payoff for cooperation

01:28:07.670 --> 01:28:10.660
to get established,
if you intermix rounds

01:28:10.660 --> 01:28:14.440
of that game with a game in
which there is very little

01:28:14.440 --> 01:28:17.860
motivation for cooperation
starting, what you see

01:28:17.860 --> 01:28:20.390
is a psychological bleed over.

01:28:20.390 --> 01:28:23.890
If you are cooperating with
this person in this game, which

01:28:23.890 --> 01:28:26.360
is now done here now
down here, it greatly

01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:29.920
increases the odds of one doing
the other game of beginning

01:28:29.920 --> 01:28:31.620
to cooperate as well.

01:28:31.620 --> 01:28:33.920
Multiple games, and
it does not take

01:28:33.920 --> 01:28:37.070
much to see that this is
more like the real world

01:28:37.070 --> 01:28:40.840
than playing prisoner's dilemma
with one single individual.

01:28:40.840 --> 01:28:44.520
Next, the possibility
of punishing someone

01:28:44.520 --> 01:28:45.780
when they are a creep.

01:28:45.780 --> 01:28:47.930
And that's what we
heard about before, what

01:28:47.930 --> 01:28:51.000
is termed now in the field
altruistic punishment.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.440
If somebody does
something crummy to you,

01:28:53.440 --> 01:28:55.550
you are allowed to
expend a certain amount

01:28:55.550 --> 01:28:59.120
of your resources to take
more of the resources

01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:00.650
away from them.

01:29:00.650 --> 01:29:02.880
That selects for cooperation.

01:29:02.880 --> 01:29:05.120
Something that
even selects faster

01:29:05.120 --> 01:29:08.380
is second party
altruistic punishing.

01:29:08.380 --> 01:29:10.900
You are not taking
part in the game.

01:29:10.900 --> 01:29:12.770
You're watching these
two individuals,

01:29:12.770 --> 01:29:15.680
But you have the power to
use some of your resources

01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:19.580
to punish a cheater--
an outside enforcer.

01:29:19.580 --> 01:29:23.760
That selects for
cooperation even faster.

01:29:23.760 --> 01:29:27.360
Then something that is even
more effective, which is

01:29:27.360 --> 01:29:30.620
termed secondary
altruistic punishing.

01:29:30.620 --> 01:29:32.080
Here's what you do.

01:29:32.080 --> 01:29:35.310
What you do is
people are observers

01:29:35.310 --> 01:29:37.970
of other people's interactions,
and seeing if they're cheating.

01:29:37.970 --> 01:29:40.177
And they can do some
altruistic punishment

01:29:40.177 --> 01:29:42.510
if they think this individual
is a jerk and all of that.

01:29:42.510 --> 01:29:43.970
But here's what you do.

01:29:43.970 --> 01:29:47.250
If there is a circumstance
where somebody cheats

01:29:47.250 --> 01:29:51.270
and this third party
individual doesn't punish them,

01:29:51.270 --> 01:29:53.230
they get punished.

01:29:53.230 --> 01:29:54.690
What's that about?

01:29:54.690 --> 01:29:56.920
That's honor code violations.

01:29:56.920 --> 01:29:59.270
That's the expectation
that you are

01:29:59.270 --> 01:30:01.850
supposed to report someone
who has had an honor code

01:30:01.850 --> 01:30:02.670
violation.

01:30:02.670 --> 01:30:05.470
And if you don't, you
will get punished.

01:30:05.470 --> 01:30:09.230
That selects for cooperation
really fast also.

01:30:09.230 --> 01:30:12.660
And all of these-- these have
been computer tournaments,

01:30:12.660 --> 01:30:13.690
and all of that.

01:30:13.690 --> 01:30:16.440
You know that world
of research by now.

01:30:16.440 --> 01:30:19.750
Finally, more subtle
stuff, gives the person

01:30:19.750 --> 01:30:22.070
the opportunity to
drop out of the game,

01:30:22.070 --> 01:30:23.620
to secede from the game.

01:30:23.620 --> 01:30:26.920
Give the person the opportunity
to not play against you,

01:30:26.920 --> 01:30:29.750
but to choose, I'll play against
all these other individuals,

01:30:29.750 --> 01:30:30.830
but not that one.

01:30:30.830 --> 01:30:32.810
Begin to put that
power in there.

01:30:32.810 --> 01:30:37.220
And you select for
cooperation that much faster.

01:30:37.220 --> 01:30:40.690
So that's some good news.

01:30:40.690 --> 01:30:44.030
Final level, the group selection
level-- group selection

01:30:44.030 --> 01:30:46.270
not in our behaving for
the good of the species,

01:30:46.270 --> 01:30:49.240
but as we know the more
modern version of it,

01:30:49.240 --> 01:30:51.150
selection for
traits that are only

01:30:51.150 --> 01:30:54.400
manifest at the level
of whole groups.

01:30:54.400 --> 01:30:59.710
A always loses to B. But groups
of A always defeat groups of B.

01:30:59.710 --> 01:31:01.340
All of the stuff
we've been seeing,

01:31:01.340 --> 01:31:05.360
people suddenly cooperating with
each other as a small group,

01:31:05.360 --> 01:31:08.530
and driving the non-cooperators
out of business,

01:31:08.530 --> 01:31:11.780
that's a group selection
argument going on there.

01:31:11.780 --> 01:31:14.880
So you can have that as
a means for generating

01:31:14.880 --> 01:31:16.390
a lot of cooperation.

01:31:16.390 --> 01:31:17.390
That's great.

01:31:17.390 --> 01:31:19.170
That makes the world
a better place,

01:31:19.170 --> 01:31:21.630
unless there is
a downside to it.

01:31:21.630 --> 01:31:24.580
And back to
chimpanzees, what do you

01:31:24.580 --> 01:31:27.390
have when a bunch
of related chimps

01:31:27.390 --> 01:31:31.180
are having not individual fights
with males from the next valley

01:31:31.180 --> 01:31:33.110
over, but functioning
as a group?

01:31:33.110 --> 01:31:36.060
You are having an example
of group selection, which

01:31:36.060 --> 01:31:40.380
thus brings up one of the
most profoundly scary things

01:31:40.380 --> 01:31:42.380
on this planet,
which is when you've

01:31:42.380 --> 01:31:43.970
got a bunch of males
who are getting

01:31:43.970 --> 01:31:45.522
along well with each other.

01:31:45.522 --> 01:31:47.480
And they're beginning to
look at the neighbors,

01:31:47.480 --> 01:31:50.250
because lots of males
cooperating together

01:31:50.250 --> 01:31:52.370
can make for some
very bad neighbors.

01:31:52.370 --> 01:31:55.130
As some people in the
field have emphasized,

01:31:55.130 --> 01:31:57.740
a decrease in homicide
within a group

01:31:57.740 --> 01:32:01.660
is a prerequisite for inventing
genocide between groups.

01:32:01.660 --> 01:32:05.530
So group selection is not always
this magical founder effect

01:32:05.530 --> 01:32:08.240
of everybody wanting to
learn the new folk songs.

01:32:08.240 --> 01:32:10.190
What you've got instead
are circumstances

01:32:10.190 --> 01:32:12.810
where it can go very wrong.

01:32:12.810 --> 01:32:16.530
Final amazing example
showing the emergence

01:32:16.530 --> 01:32:19.340
of cooperation--
and this was not

01:32:19.340 --> 01:32:21.000
a game theory demonstration.

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:22.460
This was not an experiment.

01:32:22.460 --> 01:32:25.340
This was a real
event that happened,

01:32:25.340 --> 01:32:27.320
and an extraordinary one.

01:32:27.320 --> 01:32:32.040
This occurred during World
War I. A lot of people

01:32:32.040 --> 01:32:34.310
have heard about a phenomenon
that happened there,

01:32:34.310 --> 01:32:37.680
a historical incident
that was very, very cruel,

01:32:37.680 --> 01:32:41.220
but pales in comparison to
what I'm about to tell about.

01:32:41.220 --> 01:32:45.220
In 1914, the first Christmas
of World War I, somehow

01:32:45.220 --> 01:32:46.970
the decision was made
that there was going

01:32:46.970 --> 01:32:49.010
to be a truce on Christmas Day.

01:32:49.010 --> 01:32:51.600
All of the fighting up
and down the trenches

01:32:51.600 --> 01:32:53.830
was going to cease for 24 hours.

01:32:53.830 --> 01:32:55.410
And it has been documented.

01:32:55.410 --> 01:32:58.130
It was amazing and bizarre.

01:32:58.130 --> 01:33:00.810
Men out of the
trenches playing soccer

01:33:00.810 --> 01:33:04.580
with each other from different
sides-- a bunch of German

01:33:04.580 --> 01:33:08.570
and French guys playing against
some British and German guys

01:33:08.570 --> 01:33:11.850
on the other side,
people exchanging gifts,

01:33:11.850 --> 01:33:15.100
people exchanging
helmets as souvenirs,

01:33:15.100 --> 01:33:18.170
people singing together,
people getting drunk together

01:33:18.170 --> 01:33:19.970
from the two opposite sides.

01:33:19.970 --> 01:33:22.620
And, eventually,
when the officers

01:33:22.620 --> 01:33:24.790
got them to go
back to their job,

01:33:24.790 --> 01:33:29.490
they returned to trying to kill
each other-- amazing, bizarre

01:33:29.490 --> 01:33:29.990
incident.

01:33:29.990 --> 01:33:32.850
What was very striking
about it is it extended,

01:33:32.850 --> 01:33:35.320
actually, two or three
days extra longer than

01:33:35.320 --> 01:33:37.400
planned because the
officers couldn't

01:33:37.400 --> 01:33:40.180
get people to stop doing this.

01:33:40.180 --> 01:33:41.370
That's very cool.

01:33:41.370 --> 01:33:45.190
But that's an outside
force already establishing

01:33:45.190 --> 01:33:46.570
the cooperation.

01:33:46.570 --> 01:33:49.690
Here's something much,
much more impressive.

01:33:49.690 --> 01:33:51.610
And this happened
in World War I.

01:33:51.610 --> 01:33:54.280
And it didn't take a bunch of
generals or heads of states

01:33:54.280 --> 01:33:58.240
to negotiate a truce--
the way in which truces

01:33:58.240 --> 01:34:01.970
would spontaneously
merge over and over again

01:34:01.970 --> 01:34:03.660
across the trenches.

01:34:03.660 --> 01:34:07.010
How do you generate a
reciprocally altruistic

01:34:07.010 --> 01:34:09.530
cooperative relationship
with the enemy

01:34:09.530 --> 01:34:11.190
in the trenches
over there, where

01:34:11.190 --> 01:34:12.600
you don't speak
the same language

01:34:12.600 --> 01:34:14.640
and you don't even
see their faces?

01:34:14.640 --> 01:34:16.470
Here's what you do.

01:34:16.470 --> 01:34:18.530
You take your best gunner.

01:34:18.530 --> 01:34:21.740
And have him come
up and lob a shell

01:34:21.740 --> 01:34:26.090
20 yards behind the trench
there, and blow up a tree.

01:34:26.090 --> 01:34:30.150
Now have you gunner lob a shell
to hit the exact same spot

01:34:30.150 --> 01:34:32.870
again, and do it
again, and do it again.

01:34:32.870 --> 01:34:34.240
Do it a bunch of times.

01:34:34.240 --> 01:34:36.840
What are you communicating
to the other side?

01:34:36.840 --> 01:34:38.800
This guy's really good.

01:34:38.800 --> 01:34:42.780
And we're choosing not to put
the missile down on top of you.

01:34:42.780 --> 01:34:44.540
What are you going
to do about it?

01:34:44.540 --> 01:34:47.650
And then the other side would
get out their best gunner

01:34:47.650 --> 01:34:49.320
and do the thing in return.

01:34:49.320 --> 01:34:53.270
And you have just worked
out a non-aggression pact.

01:34:53.270 --> 01:34:55.710
And this occurred
over and over again

01:34:55.710 --> 01:34:58.840
in the trench warfare,
documented in letters

01:34:58.840 --> 01:35:01.730
by soldiers back home
to parents, saying,

01:35:01.730 --> 01:35:03.080
hi Mom and Dad.

01:35:03.080 --> 01:35:04.610
Things are OK here.

01:35:04.610 --> 01:35:06.360
I hope you're worrying
less, because we've

01:35:06.360 --> 01:35:07.740
worked out something.

01:35:07.740 --> 01:35:09.650
Things are a lot better here.

01:35:09.650 --> 01:35:12.430
There's a lot less
people getting hurt.

01:35:12.430 --> 01:35:16.100
Working it out along those
lines, working out a tit

01:35:16.100 --> 01:35:18.830
for tat vulnerability
where you had

01:35:18.830 --> 01:35:22.820
to have a forgiving tit
for tat, what if somebody

01:35:22.820 --> 01:35:24.910
messed up and
accidentally dropped

01:35:24.910 --> 01:35:27.510
a shell into the trench
on the other side?

01:35:27.510 --> 01:35:30.270
They got one shot back.

01:35:30.270 --> 01:35:33.270
Letters, dear Mom and
Dad, things are OK here.

01:35:33.270 --> 01:35:35.004
We had an incident
the other day.

01:35:35.004 --> 01:35:36.670
We had this new gunner
who didn't really

01:35:36.670 --> 01:35:38.240
understand how things worked.

01:35:38.240 --> 01:35:40.670
And I heard he killed
four people on their side.

01:35:40.670 --> 01:35:41.720
They shot one back.

01:35:41.720 --> 01:35:43.136
They took out three
of our people.

01:35:43.136 --> 01:35:44.940
But everything is OK now.

01:35:44.940 --> 01:35:48.250
Tit for tat, complete
with a forgiving element--

01:35:48.250 --> 01:35:51.490
this happened again,
and again, and again,

01:35:51.490 --> 01:35:52.860
in the trench warfare.

01:35:52.860 --> 01:35:55.750
And the only thing that
stopped it from spreading

01:35:55.750 --> 01:35:57.760
is the fact that
the officers kept

01:35:57.760 --> 01:36:00.450
insisting that nobody
else was doing this.

01:36:00.450 --> 01:36:03.130
And these guys were going to
get shot and court marshaled

01:36:03.130 --> 01:36:05.070
if they didn't stop this.

01:36:05.070 --> 01:36:08.190
And if they had only
had cell phones,

01:36:08.190 --> 01:36:11.100
if they only had
communication, if they only

01:36:11.100 --> 01:36:13.840
had a way of knowing
up and down the line

01:36:13.840 --> 01:36:16.170
that everybody was
doing this, they

01:36:16.170 --> 01:36:19.000
would have stopped the
war-- not with a treaty,

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.010
not with generals, not
with heads of state,

01:36:21.010 --> 01:36:23.710
not with diplomats,
but simply a bottom

01:36:23.710 --> 01:36:26.510
up way of evolving cooperation.

01:36:26.510 --> 01:36:28.340
And they would have
stopped the war

01:36:28.340 --> 01:36:31.030
if they knew that they
weren't the only ones wanting

01:36:31.030 --> 01:36:35.920
to do this-- amazing
historical incident.

01:36:35.920 --> 01:36:38.840
OK, so this gets us to
the end of aggression.

01:36:38.840 --> 01:36:41.640
As you probably noticed,
this has gone on way long.

01:36:41.640 --> 01:36:43.560
This is the longest
amount of material

01:36:43.560 --> 01:36:45.270
we spend on anything
in the course.

01:36:45.270 --> 01:36:47.700
And each year, it
actually gets longer.

01:36:47.700 --> 01:36:50.920
And I actually think I
know the reason for it.

01:36:50.920 --> 01:36:52.420
Three and a half
lectures ago, where

01:36:52.420 --> 01:36:56.280
did I start off talking
about my recent exposure

01:36:56.280 --> 01:36:58.520
to human aggression,
which was my doing it,

01:36:58.520 --> 01:37:00.670
and tripping up that
jerk playing soccer.

01:37:00.670 --> 01:37:02.570
And everybody was all excited.

01:37:02.570 --> 01:37:05.010
Let me tell you
about another time,

01:37:05.010 --> 01:37:06.620
the most serious
time I have ever been

01:37:06.620 --> 01:37:09.120
exposed to human aggression.

01:37:09.120 --> 01:37:11.686
This took place
when I was about 20.

01:37:11.686 --> 01:37:14.420
And this was first
year that I was

01:37:14.420 --> 01:37:16.200
doing research in East Africa.

01:37:16.200 --> 01:37:20.100
During that time, the famed
notorious dictator Idi Amin

01:37:20.100 --> 01:37:21.620
was running Uganda.

01:37:21.620 --> 01:37:23.930
And he was a nightmare.

01:37:23.930 --> 01:37:26.810
He was just killing
people left and right,

01:37:26.810 --> 01:37:30.270
destroying the country, as
documented, cannibalizing.

01:37:30.270 --> 01:37:32.670
Was a nightmare of a dictator.

01:37:32.670 --> 01:37:34.710
Around the time,
he made a mistake.

01:37:34.710 --> 01:37:39.359
This was spring of 1979, which
is he invaded Tanzania and took

01:37:39.359 --> 01:37:40.900
over some of the
land there, thinking

01:37:40.900 --> 01:37:42.660
the Tanzanians
wouldn't fight back.

01:37:42.660 --> 01:37:44.680
And he miscalculated.

01:37:44.680 --> 01:37:48.250
The Tanzania army
counterattacked, and drove them

01:37:48.250 --> 01:37:52.110
out of Uganda, and decided to
drive all the way to Kampala,

01:37:52.110 --> 01:37:53.440
the capital of Uganda.

01:37:53.440 --> 01:37:55.510
And they overthrew Idi Amin.

01:37:55.510 --> 01:37:56.930
He fled the country.

01:37:56.930 --> 01:37:59.210
And the country was liberated.

01:37:59.210 --> 01:38:00.590
They continued through there.

01:38:00.590 --> 01:38:03.610
And they opened up a corridor
to the Kenyan border.

01:38:03.610 --> 01:38:05.930
So it was now a swath all
through the southern part

01:38:05.930 --> 01:38:08.790
of the country that was
controlled by Tanzania.

01:38:08.790 --> 01:38:11.560
So the day after the
Tanzanians got things

01:38:11.560 --> 01:38:15.040
to the Kenyan border,
I went into Uganda.

01:38:15.040 --> 01:38:16.800
OK, why?

01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:19.340
This was amazing.

01:38:19.340 --> 01:38:20.630
This was history happening.

01:38:20.630 --> 01:38:23.870
You were hearing on the BBC
that people were dancing

01:38:23.870 --> 01:38:25.440
in the streets in Kampala.

01:38:25.440 --> 01:38:28.940
They had been liberated,
amazing chance to see history.

01:38:28.940 --> 01:38:30.550
This was-- through
our college, I

01:38:30.550 --> 01:38:33.240
had been spending a lot
of time with Quakers,

01:38:33.240 --> 01:38:36.160
and wrestling with those
issues, and figured

01:38:36.160 --> 01:38:38.530
if there is anything that
counts as a just war,

01:38:38.530 --> 01:38:39.370
this would be it.

01:38:39.370 --> 01:38:40.780
What does this seem like?

01:38:40.780 --> 01:38:42.692
All these philosophical
principles.

01:38:42.692 --> 01:38:44.900
This, actually, of course,
was not what was going on.

01:38:44.900 --> 01:38:47.360
I was a 20-year-old male.

01:38:47.360 --> 01:38:50.780
And somebody had been staying
with me, and no longer was.

01:38:50.780 --> 01:38:52.120
And I was all bummed out.

01:38:52.120 --> 01:38:55.370
And, thus, I did sort of
a very 20-year-old male

01:38:55.370 --> 01:38:58.400
adolescent primate thing,
which is figuring some violence

01:38:58.400 --> 01:39:00.960
would do some good things
for my brain neurochemistry.

01:39:00.960 --> 01:39:03.290
And I wanted to go see a war.

01:39:03.290 --> 01:39:05.910
So I went off to Uganda,
hitching through there.

01:39:05.910 --> 01:39:08.930
And it was
appropriately exciting.

01:39:08.930 --> 01:39:11.850
And some things happened that
scared the bejesus out of me.

01:39:11.850 --> 01:39:14.576
And at some point, I finally
decided I have had enough.

01:39:14.576 --> 01:39:15.700
I want to go back to Kenya.

01:39:15.700 --> 01:39:16.956
I want to feel safe again.

01:39:16.956 --> 01:39:17.830
So I'm hitching back.

01:39:17.830 --> 01:39:19.620
But I had one last
thing that I want

01:39:19.620 --> 01:39:21.930
to do, which was
since I was a kid,

01:39:21.930 --> 01:39:23.850
I had grown up reading
about the explorers,

01:39:23.850 --> 01:39:26.400
and the search for the source
of the Nile and all of that.

01:39:26.400 --> 01:39:30.210
The source of the white
Nile is in Uganda.

01:39:30.210 --> 01:39:34.020
It comes out of Lake Victoria
in a town called Tororo.

01:39:34.020 --> 01:39:36.250
And there's a spot
there, a bridge

01:39:36.250 --> 01:39:37.900
where you can go and stand.

01:39:37.900 --> 01:39:40.950
And here is where the
Nile River begins.

01:39:40.950 --> 01:39:43.080
And I had to see
this before leaving.

01:39:43.080 --> 01:39:45.160
And I managed to get
a ride into there.

01:39:45.160 --> 01:39:48.810
And I managed to get over to
this bridge, and stood there.

01:39:48.810 --> 01:39:52.179
And there was this
sort of dam thing

01:39:52.179 --> 01:39:53.970
that was built that
this bridge was on top.

01:39:53.970 --> 01:39:56.660
And there was this sluice where
all the water came spritzing

01:39:56.660 --> 01:39:58.160
out, and started the Nile.

01:39:58.160 --> 01:39:58.910
And I stood there.

01:39:58.910 --> 01:40:00.420
And I looked over the side.

01:40:00.420 --> 01:40:04.280
And what I saw was there
was a Ugandan soldier

01:40:04.280 --> 01:40:05.620
who had been taken down there.

01:40:05.620 --> 01:40:09.070
There was a staircase along the
side down to some sort of panel

01:40:09.070 --> 01:40:11.400
for controls or whatever.

01:40:11.400 --> 01:40:13.710
And a Ugandan soldier
had been taken down

01:40:13.710 --> 01:40:16.420
the steps, his hands
tied behind his back,

01:40:16.420 --> 01:40:18.470
and a rope tied
around his throat

01:40:18.470 --> 01:40:20.230
and attached to the panel.

01:40:20.230 --> 01:40:22.430
So that as the
water level rose, he

01:40:22.430 --> 01:40:24.530
would eventually be
swept off his feet

01:40:24.530 --> 01:40:28.310
and would be strangled
and drowned in the water.

01:40:28.310 --> 01:40:31.270
And this body had obviously
been there for days.

01:40:31.270 --> 01:40:32.580
It was bloated.

01:40:32.580 --> 01:40:33.970
It was floating there.

01:40:33.970 --> 01:40:35.940
It was being bashed
around on the waves.

01:40:35.940 --> 01:40:38.140
There were crocs
trying to get at it.

01:40:38.140 --> 01:40:42.750
And looking at this guy, a total
storm of emotions-- thinking,

01:40:42.750 --> 01:40:46.910
good, that's what you deserve
being in the army for Amin.

01:40:46.910 --> 01:40:48.380
Then thinking,
no, wait a second.

01:40:48.380 --> 01:40:50.630
This is probably some poor
guy who was forced to do it

01:40:50.630 --> 01:40:52.260
and was just following orders.

01:40:52.260 --> 01:40:54.810
Then thinking, no, I know
what I think of soldiers

01:40:54.810 --> 01:40:56.200
who just follow orders.

01:40:56.200 --> 01:40:58.560
Then thinking, whoa, I would
love to get a lot closer

01:40:58.560 --> 01:41:00.060
and see what's
happening down there.

01:41:00.060 --> 01:41:02.700
And thinking, I want to get as
far away from here as possible.

01:41:02.700 --> 01:41:05.320
And I stood there for
an hour and a half

01:41:05.320 --> 01:41:10.010
at that spot staring at this guy
until some Tanzanian soldiers

01:41:10.010 --> 01:41:11.750
chased me away from there.

01:41:11.750 --> 01:41:15.300
And I think now, 33
years later, that I

01:41:15.300 --> 01:41:18.800
lecture longer and longer about
aggression each year because

01:41:18.800 --> 01:41:20.390
of that guy.

01:41:20.390 --> 01:41:22.930
What do we do here
in our business?

01:41:22.930 --> 01:41:26.320
We have this general notion
that if we are rational,

01:41:26.320 --> 01:41:28.870
if we are learned,
if we are scholarly,

01:41:28.870 --> 01:41:31.640
if we respect thoughts
and truth and all of that,

01:41:31.640 --> 01:41:33.920
we will make the
world a better place.

01:41:33.920 --> 01:41:36.640
All of us who are professorial
have somewhere in there

01:41:36.640 --> 01:41:39.090
this totally ridiculous
belief that if you're

01:41:39.090 --> 01:41:41.770
allowed to lecture at
a subject long enough,

01:41:41.770 --> 01:41:43.580
it will give up and go away.

01:41:43.580 --> 01:41:45.630
And that will be the cure
for world aggression.

01:41:45.630 --> 01:41:47.300
If everybody can
only be lectured

01:41:47.300 --> 01:41:51.740
to about the frontal cortex,
it will solve world violence.

01:41:51.740 --> 01:41:54.280
But the basic problem
is that aggression is

01:41:54.280 --> 01:41:57.250
such a messy set of behaviors.

01:41:57.250 --> 01:42:00.900
Schizophrenia-- no question
about it, bad news.

01:42:00.900 --> 01:42:04.300
Alzheimer's disease, childhood
cancer, global warming,

01:42:04.300 --> 01:42:07.610
all of these
unassailably bad news.

01:42:07.610 --> 01:42:10.710
But aggression is a whole
lot more complicated,

01:42:10.710 --> 01:42:13.190
because of that point
where we started with,

01:42:13.190 --> 01:42:16.420
which is the same
exact behaviors,

01:42:16.420 --> 01:42:18.530
and depending on the
context, it could

01:42:18.530 --> 01:42:21.870
be something that would get
a medal for someone, someone

01:42:21.870 --> 01:42:25.890
you will want to mate with, vote
for, reward, cheer on, join in.

01:42:25.890 --> 01:42:28.220
And in another setting,
it is the most frightening

01:42:28.220 --> 01:42:30.070
possible thing that
can happen to us.

01:42:30.070 --> 01:42:33.510
And it's the same behaviors
in all those cases.

01:42:33.510 --> 01:42:36.250
And it's for that reason,
that violence is always

01:42:36.250 --> 01:42:38.800
going to be the hardest
subject for us to understand

01:42:38.800 --> 01:42:39.880
biologically.

01:42:39.880 --> 01:42:42.340
And it's for that
reason, that it's always

01:42:42.340 --> 01:42:46.340
going to be the one we have
to try hardest to understand.

01:42:46.340 --> 01:42:49.550
