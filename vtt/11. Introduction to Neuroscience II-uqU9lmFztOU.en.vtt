00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:05.855
Stanford University.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.190
I would like to get
started, please.

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.700
So my name is Patrick House.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.250
I am a neuroscience PhD student.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.080
I work with Robert
in Robert's lab.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.906
I'm a first year.

00:00:21.906 --> 00:00:24.030
And I study something that
you guys will eventually

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.890
hear about, but I don't
want to ruin the punchline.

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.680
But today we're going to talk
about memory and plasticity.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.520
And so two days
ago on Wednesday,

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.770
you guys all sat in
here, in this room.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.770
And you learned, some of
you for the first time,

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.520
some of you for maybe
the 10th time, the basics

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.700
of neurobiology, of
how a neuron works,

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.700
how a neuron-- you have
a presynaptic cell,

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.600
you have a postsynaptic
cell, and this kind

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.920
of simplified version of the
communication and information

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:52.490
transfer.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.629
And something
interesting happened

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.420
between now and then,
which is that now you

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:57.880
sit in the same room.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.660
And something about you knows
something about neuroscience

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.590
now.

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.140
You heard one of the TAs talk.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.270
You slept on it.

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.100
And then you come
back now and you

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.400
have assimilated, integrated
into your identity,

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.910
into what you know, new facts.

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:17.010
And this lecture is
about how you do that.

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.554
And to kind of get
at what memory is,

00:01:21.554 --> 00:01:23.470
we need to think about
a lot of different ways

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.150
in which it's interesting, and
a lot of different spectrums

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.850
and severities about memory.

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.600
So why is it that some
memories last our entire lives,

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.239
whereas other memories, we
hear and they're fleeting?

00:01:36.239 --> 00:01:37.280
They go away in a second.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.934
Why is it that someone
sitting next to you in bed,

00:01:41.934 --> 00:01:43.350
telling you a
story, and as you go

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.962
to sleep you can't remember it?

00:01:44.962 --> 00:01:46.920
As you wake up, you can't
remember your dreams.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.850
But if that exact same
person, that exact same story

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.950
was told to you as they were
sitting next to you in a car,

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.970
and you get into a
car accident, suddenly

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.230
that memory becomes salient.

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:58.540
You may remember it for years,
if not your entire life.

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:03.100
And you may actually associate
either the story itself,

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.100
the voice of the person,
with that traumatic event.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.509
And you might get
post-traumatic stress disorder.

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.820
So if the mechanism is
the same between these two

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.010
types of memory, between ones
that are fleeting and forgetful

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.960
and ones that last your
entire life, the question is,

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.070
how does environment,
how does context

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.390
fit into shaping these
types of memories?

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.490
And so in order to
understand that,

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.940
we have to kind of get at, what
are the mechanisms of memory?

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.300
And how are these
contextually motivated?

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.400
So I want introduce to you
first Stephen Wiltshire,

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.490
who is an architect, if not
in practice, at least in mind.

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.750
He is an autistic savant.

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.620
And he has been mute
since age three.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.210
And he has this remarkable
capacity, which I'm actually

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:57.640
going to test you guys on
slightly here, if you have

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.530
any kind of
inclination to sketch,

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.080
or you happen to have some
sketch paper with you.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.680
I want you to-- this will
take approximately 60 seconds

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.970
to span across all
of Rome-- draw it

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.510
from memory in your 60 seconds.

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.120
Because Stephen Wiltshire
has this amazing capacity

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.982
to take helicopter rides--
he's done this over Tokyo.

00:03:15.982 --> 00:03:17.190
He's done this over New York.

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.960
He's done this over
Rome and over London.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.600
And in 20 minutes,
he can then sit down

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.720
and recreate every single
building, every single column,

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.910
every single window in
correct proportions,

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.890
from the correct angle in
which the helicopter ride was.

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.740
And so you may be thinking-- OK,
your 60 seconds are almost up.

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.630
Can you guys do it?

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.620
You may be thinking-- if any
of you are artists out there,

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.690
you may be thinking
this is unfair.

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.640
Why can't I do this?

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.360
And as neuroscientists,
our first thought

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.100
is, OK, this is unfair.

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.000
Why can't I do this?

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.810
But really, it can
tell us something

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.430
interesting about memory.

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.670
So you come at it
with two questions.

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.640
First question-- before and
after this helicopter ride,

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.500
what is different
in Stephen's brain?

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.530
And second, on this theme
of individual variation

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.360
that we keep harping on in
class, why is it that he can

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.259
do this and we can't do this?

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:17.800
And these are two
important questions

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.540
that if we could
answer those questions,

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.079
we would know a lot
about what memory is.

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:30.860
And so it really
makes sense to go back

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.660
to what it is that we
know so far about neurons,

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.100
the basics of one neuron
and how it is activated.

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.240
And so we have a
presynaptic cell,

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.450
and we have a postsynaptic cell.

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:49.070
And in our simplified version,
we can kind of know now--

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.440
and what I'm going to
tell you is that memory,

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:56.400
learning happens, to the best of
our knowledge, in the synapse,

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.526
in the space between the pre
and the postsynaptic cell.

00:05:00.526 --> 00:05:03.150
But to understand why it is that
we think that, we kind of need

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.226
to go back about 100
years to when people,

00:05:07.226 --> 00:05:09.600
scientists, neuroscientists
were investigating the brain,

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:10.820
investigating memory.

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:15.870
And they thought that the
smallest unit of the brain

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:17.810
that they knew was the neuron.

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:21.720
So because of our
tendency to explain

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.830
what we don't know in terms
are the smallest unit of thing

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:26.530
that we do know,
they thought OK,

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:31.040
this makes sense-- a
memory is a new neuron.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.640
And when you learn
a new fact, when

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.890
you learn the basics
of neuroscience,

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:37.830
you are growing new neurons.

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:41.690
And each individual fact is
associated with one new neuron.

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:44.540
For instance, they
may have thought

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:47.100
that OK, you guys learned
on Wednesday that the axon

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:51.280
hillock is the site of the
generation of the action

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:52.120
potential.

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.875
So then that is a new
fact, and then a new neuron

00:05:54.875 --> 00:05:55.750
would then be formed.

00:06:00.877 --> 00:06:03.210
I just realized that that
actually might not make sense,

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:06.590
because at the time that they
thought that, they didn't know

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:09.890
what an axon hillock is,
so maybe that formulation

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:11.850
doesn't even make sense.

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:16.382
But the idea is that a
couple decades later, people

00:06:16.382 --> 00:06:17.340
discovered the synapse.

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:18.780
They discovered that
neurons were not just

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:20.696
one interconnected thing,
that there is space.

00:06:20.696 --> 00:06:21.930
There is a gap between them.

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:23.930
And as soon as they
discovered the synapse, that

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:26.510
then became the smallest
bit of information

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:27.840
we knew about the brain.

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:31.850
And then theories came out
saying, well, no, memory

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:34.110
must be the formation
of synapses.

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:39.540
So the dogma at the time was
then that OK, new fact, axon

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:40.380
hillock.

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:41.910
What does this
mean in the brain?

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:43.160
You can see this in the brain.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.460
This takes the shape of a
new synapse being formed.

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:52.200
And what we think of now is that
well, this isn't exactly right,

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:54.790
because new synapses are not
being formed all the time.

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:57.360
And new neurons are not formed
in the adult brain, which

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:59.540
isn't entirely true, but
we'll get back to that.

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:05.689
But the idea is just that
memory and storage of learning,

00:07:05.689 --> 00:07:07.980
what I'm going to tell you
is that it's in the synapse,

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:11.629
and that it involves modulation
and change of the synapse.

00:07:11.629 --> 00:07:12.670
And why do we think that?

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:15.790
Because we understand
the molecules.

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:17.614
And we understand
at a molecular level

00:07:17.614 --> 00:07:19.530
what's happening in a
synapse when it changes.

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:22.180
So that it is thus
now our smallest level

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:23.550
of understanding of the brain.

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:26.050
And so of course, we
think oh, well that's

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:29.030
probably where memory is.

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:32.150
So that's the dogma that
we're going to start with.

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:34.630
And we're going to
start with this idea

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:36.950
that memory is
synaptic plasticity.

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:39.890
Memory is when the
space between the

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:42.950
presynaptic and postsynaptic
neuron changes in some way.

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:45.360
And not only that, it
changes in one direction.

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:46.270
It gets stronger.

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:47.380
It's strengthened.

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:50.150
And so what this
means is that if you

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:53.620
have your presynaptic
neuron and you fire it,

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:58.000
and you get some
amount of response,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.090
that over time, if you give
enough presynaptic activation

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:06.040
in a certain time window, that
you will then get a heightened,

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:09.144
strengthened response in your
postsynaptic cell eventually.

00:08:09.144 --> 00:08:10.560
And that is the
kind of mechanism,

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:15.250
the overarching, broad
mechanism of LTP.

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:18.390
And so what we need to
do to understand memory

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:20.730
is to focus on the synapse.

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:23.180
So what we get is our
classical picture, which

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:24.560
is that you have your synapse.

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:27.210
And a neurotransmitter
is coming out.

00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:29.560
And that neurotransmitter
is excitatory.

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:33.500
And in your postsynaptic
cell, what you're getting is

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:35.360
you're getting a small
amount of activation.

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.590
You're getting current
that comes into that cell.

00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:40.490
You're getting ions,
some sort of response

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:45.250
for any individual piece
of neurotransmitter.

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:49.990
So what this is, is a
version, a simplified version,

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:52.040
of what is called
Hebbian plasticity.

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:54.260
And so there's this guy
Hebb, which you have to know.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.593
There's a few of names you
have to know in neuroscience,

00:08:56.593 --> 00:08:57.580
and he's one of them.

00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:01.537
And Hebb came up with this
idea, the only bumper sticker

00:09:01.537 --> 00:09:03.620
that neuroscientists ever
have on their car, which

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:07.480
is that neurons that fire
together wire together.

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:11.320
And what this is saying is that
you have your standard picture

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:13.700
of a very, very simplified
version of a presynaptic cell

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:16.800
that's releasing an
excitatory neurotransmitter,

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:19.390
and that when it does
so, you get a response

00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:20.550
in your postsynaptic cell.

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:29.010
So if you will remember
from one lecture ago,

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:33.220
that excitatory
neurotransmitter is glutamate,

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:35.440
though if you're going
to spend any time

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:37.670
and energy into remembering
one neurotransmitter that

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:39.440
might be relevant for
the class, this is

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:41.470
the one you want to remember.

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:43.360
You don't have to remember it.

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:46.177
So mostly, the idea is
just that it's excitatory.

00:09:46.177 --> 00:09:47.260
And why is this important?

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.510
Because information is
transferred in the brain

00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:50.830
through activation.

00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:52.700
And in order to
transfer information,

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:54.830
you need excitatory
neurotransmitters.

00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:58.200
You need your neurons
to be activated.

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:01.160
But as we know from
what I've told you

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:04.590
so far, that repetition
is what drives memory,

00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:08.470
I would suggest that you
remember that glutamate

00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:10.660
is the excitatory, and one
and only neurotransmitter

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:11.710
that you have to know.

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:14.750
Say there's a test
question that says,

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:16.550
what is the one excitatory
neurotransmitter

00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:18.008
in the brain that
you have to know?

00:10:18.008 --> 00:10:19.180
You would respond glutamate.

00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:21.800
And then you would be right.

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:26.110
And so you can imagine that
for this type of simplified

00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:27.769
diagram, if we
were to strengthen

00:10:27.769 --> 00:10:30.060
the synapse, if we were to
get some sort of plasticity,

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:32.840
some sort of change,
potentiation,

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:35.670
you could think of a
few ways of doing this.

00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:38.750
You could take the
presynaptic neuron

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:42.510
and change how much excitatory
neurotransmitter is released.

00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:44.870
You could change how much
glutamate is released.

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:48.110
And presumably, if you release
more of the little circles

00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:51.080
with positive charge
in them, then you're

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:55.850
going to get more activation
in the postsynaptic cell.

00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:59.040
Another thing you could
do is basic neurochemistry

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:02.120
in this diagram, is that each
of those neurotransmitters

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:04.670
is binding to a receptor
on the postsynaptic cell.

00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:08.640
And so what you can do is
take that individual receptor.

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:12.210
And you can make it respond more
to a single, individual unit

00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:15.300
quanta of neurotransmitter.

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:17.360
Alternately, you
could just increase

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:20.860
the number of postsynaptic
receptors on your cell.

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:23.150
And all of these would
be mechanisms by which

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:25.770
you could take this
very, very simple synapse

00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:30.560
and potentiate it, such that
you get the same release,

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:32.490
you get the same
neurotransmitter.

00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:35.180
And what you get is subtle,
because LTP is often

00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:36.130
very subtle.

00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:40.110
You'll just notice that the
response is slightly larger,

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:42.750
a slightly larger response
given the same amount of input,

00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:45.300
given the same amount of
output of the presynaptic cell.

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:49.710
And this is the entire idea of
LTP, long-term potentiation,

00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:52.750
this idea that at your
individual synapse,

00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:54.130
you can potentiate it.

00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:54.900
You can change it.

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:57.250
It is plastic.

00:11:57.250 --> 00:12:02.200
But there should be
one large red flag

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:08.820
here, which is--
one of these caveats

00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:11.150
is, well, your
presynaptic neuron,

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:14.640
how does it know whether or
not LTP should be undergone?

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:17.560
How does it know whether or
not LTP has been induced?

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:19.980
This requires a kind
of communication

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:23.430
between both the pre and
the postsynaptic cell,

00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:26.590
that how would the presynaptic
cell, which has already

00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:28.790
released its
neurotransmitter, know?

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:32.070
And what you get is this
kind of heretical type

00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:34.430
of neurotransmitter
that can actually-- we

00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:36.430
call it a retrograde
neurotransmitter--

00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:40.100
that can actually be sent back
from the postsynaptic cell.

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:41.550
And it's a gas.

00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:43.390
Nitric oxide is
an example of one.

00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:45.350
It's what you get
at your dentist.

00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:47.490
And it kind of goes
back and diffuses

00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:50.420
back across the synapse
and actually modulates

00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:52.470
how much neurotransmitter
gets released

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:54.220
from the presynaptic cell.

00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:58.080
So we have these mechanisms.

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:00.430
We have these mechanisms of LTP.

00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:05.520
And the question then is, where
does this happen in the brain?

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:07.610
And why is it that
we believe that these

00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:10.370
are the places of LTP?

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:12.880
And one of the things
you need to know--

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:15.310
this is our first dive
into neuroanatomy--

00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:17.590
is you need to know
the hippocampus.

00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:19.370
It was introduced
to you last lecture.

00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:21.372
But if there's one
neurotransmitter you

00:13:21.372 --> 00:13:22.580
need to know, it's glutamate.

00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:24.700
And if there's one neural
anatomical structure

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:26.908
you need to know at this
point, it's the hippocampus.

00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:34.140
I'm kind of always jealous of
these autistic savants that

00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:37.890
can memorize 10,000 digits of
pi, and take a helicopter ride

00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:42.120
and then fully recreate the
cityscape of any city they see.

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:44.450
And if you read interviews
about how they do it,

00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:46.130
it's really interesting.

00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:49.830
So what they seem to
do is not memorize

00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:52.410
just a sheet of a bunch of
digits, a string of 10,000

00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:53.510
digits of pi.

00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:57.630
They'll take a walk through
their childhood town.

00:13:57.630 --> 00:13:59.610
And they'll say that they
put one of the digits

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:01.184
on each and every object.

00:14:01.184 --> 00:14:02.850
So your mailbox will
be the first digit,

00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:04.840
and then your neighbor's
door will be another,

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:06.580
and then their
window will be three.

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:10.190
And then they are
not re-conceiving

00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:12.630
and reconstructing just a
sheet of boring numbers.

00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:18.030
They're taking spatial
tours through their memory.

00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:22.080
And what this always
compels me to do

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:24.464
is make these kind
of visual mnemonics.

00:14:24.464 --> 00:14:26.880
So I'm going to give you a
visual mnemonic for the one way

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:29.590
you have to remember
that the hippocampus is

00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:34.080
the site of memory
and the site of LTP,

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:36.440
insofar as this class is
concerned, which is-- OK,

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:37.860
hippo horse.

00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:40.360
We learned that last time, it
looks kind of like a seahorse.

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:42.382
But that doesn't
really make sense.

00:14:42.382 --> 00:14:43.590
What if you think about this?

00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:45.880
What if you think about the
hippodrome back in Rome?

00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:48.150
Hippodrome is the
circular arena where

00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:51.730
you had your little chariot
races, because of horses.

00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:54.126
And there's two
different scenarios

00:14:54.126 --> 00:14:55.250
that I want you to imagine.

00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:59.250
The first is-- you guys remember
Michael Jordan and Larry Bird?

00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:01.990
They had this commercial
where they played Horse.

00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:04.140
And what they were doing
is they were playing-- you

00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:06.530
have to make a basketball shot.

00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:08.500
And then the next one,
you have to remember

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:10.420
what that first
person did exactly,

00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:12.080
and you have to recreate it.

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:14.540
So what I like to imagine is
Larry Bird and Michael Jordan

00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:17.630
playing a game of horse in
the hippodrome, back in Rome.

00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:21.400
And then you can kind of
get this idea of how memory

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:22.659
is related to the hippocampus.

00:15:22.659 --> 00:15:23.700
and this horse structure.

00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:24.600
And if that doesn't
work for you,

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:25.810
I have one more,
which is actually

00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:27.430
my favorite, which
is you can imagine

00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:30.860
the entire amphitheatre,
the entire hippodrome filled

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:31.360
with people.

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:36.335
And there was that one emperor
who named his horse a senator.

00:15:36.335 --> 00:15:37.544
Do you guys know who that is?

00:15:37.544 --> 00:15:38.209
What's his name.

00:15:38.209 --> 00:15:39.150
I don't know his name.

00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:39.996
Caligula.

00:15:39.996 --> 00:15:41.400
Caligula, there you go.

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:44.700
So imagine the entire hippodrome
is filled with people.

00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:45.730
And Caligula is there.

00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:48.980
And he gets his senator horse
in the middle of the field.

00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:50.910
And the horse is sitting
kind of cross-legged.

00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:56.910
And he's typing out your
memoirs on a typewriter.

00:15:56.910 --> 00:15:59.120
And that is how you're
going to remember

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:01.640
that the hippocampus, the
hippodrome, the horse,

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:03.790
is where memory is formed.

00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:07.620
So now you guys are all
autistic savants now.

00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:13.420
Really though, what
we need to determine

00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:15.900
is, why is it that
we really think

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:19.720
that the hippocampus is the site
of LTP and memory formation?

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:24.150
It turns out that there is
actually adult neurogenesis

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:25.670
and adult plasticity.

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:28.410
So in the last 10
years, we've discovered

00:16:28.410 --> 00:16:31.160
that the adult brain really
does actually form new neurons.

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:33.810
And for the last 100 years,
we kind of disregarded that

00:16:33.810 --> 00:16:36.210
and said those guys
who initially believed

00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:39.497
that every new neuron is
associated with every new fact,

00:16:39.497 --> 00:16:41.580
those guys were just totally
wrong and ridiculous.

00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:43.220
What a ridiculous concept.

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:45.100
And so perhaps
eventually, in the future,

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:46.810
we will have to
incorporate this idea

00:16:46.810 --> 00:16:51.520
that there does seem to be
some neurogenesis in the brain.

00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:55.380
But much like how we
learned that there

00:16:55.380 --> 00:17:01.930
is non-genetic inherited
traits, which we had learned

00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:06.510
from the disreputable Lamarck,
way back in Lamarckian

00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:08.950
evolution, that there
is no-- for 100 years,

00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:10.460
we thought, no, it's impossible.

00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:14.079
There is no non-genetic
inheritance of traits.

00:17:14.079 --> 00:17:17.040
But it turns out
that, well, OK, we

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:20.060
do seem to have some kind
of non-genetic inheritance.

00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:22.778
And so Lamarck isn't
entirely wrong.

00:17:22.778 --> 00:17:25.069
And it turns out this is a
kind of similar thing, where

00:17:25.069 --> 00:17:28.950
the people of most disrepute are
often just a little bit right.

00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:31.050
So probably, people
that used to think

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:33.970
that adult neurogenesis has
something to do with memory

00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:36.770
are probably a little bit right.

00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:39.060
But we're going to stick
with the canon, which

00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:45.420
is that LTP happens,
and that it happens not

00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:47.920
on the level of the neuron, not
on the level of the synapse,

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:51.820
but on the level of the
plasticity of the synapse.

00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:54.110
And so why do we think
it's the hippocampus?

00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:57.160
We get at it from a few ways.

00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:01.080
The first way is that HM, this
kind of well-dressed epileptic

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:05.470
who had his hippocampi removed.

00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:07.400
And what happened was
he had selective removal

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:08.840
of just his hippocampi.

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:12.380
And he could no longer
remember anything at all.

00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:14.590
He could not form new
memories whatsoever.

00:18:14.590 --> 00:18:18.130
So with these types
of conclusions,

00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:23.200
in addition to evidence
that if you watch and record

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:26.080
from neurons in the hippocampus
as you're giving someone

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:30.040
a learning task,
then you see LTP.

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:33.040
If you pharmacologically
block LTP,

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:36.300
you see changes in
the hippocampus.

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:37.760
And so all these
pieces of evidence

00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:41.800
are trying to get at the
idea that the hippocampus is

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:45.710
necessary for memory and
memory consolidation.

00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:48.540
But if you introspect
a little bit,

00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:51.880
you can probably
realize that well, we

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:54.610
undergo all kinds of forms
of learning and memory.

00:18:54.610 --> 00:18:55.800
We have motor learning.

00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:57.350
We learn how to shoot baskets.

00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:59.300
We learn how to throw darts.

00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:04.120
We understand
emotionally that events

00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:07.110
that are more emotionally
salient are more memorable.

00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:09.370
And so how is it that
these types of things

00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:12.580
are also encoded
in our brain, also

00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:15.420
encoded in the same region, the
one region, the hippocampus?

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:17.950
And what that turns out
to be is that, well, it's

00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:19.040
not just that one region.

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:21.370
LTP is happening
all over the brain,

00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:24.710
that if you look in your
emotional regulation centers,

00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:28.420
if you look in your emotional
cortices, you also see LTP.

00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:31.750
And this makes sense, because
these types of memories

00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:35.910
have to have different methods
of storage and retrieval.

00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:43.910
And also, that you can imagine
this type of excitation,

00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:49.520
this type of synaptic
plasticity, can go wrong.

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:51.250
In post-traumatic
stress disorder,

00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:53.300
for instance, you get LTP.

00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:55.690
And you get LTP that is severe.

00:19:55.690 --> 00:19:58.900
And you get severe LTP
potentiation of your synapses

00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:01.800
in those emotion
regulation centers that

00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:06.510
create a situation where the
context leads to memories that

00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:08.950
shouldn't necessarily
be brought up,

00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:11.040
that shouldn't
necessarily be retrieved.

00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:16.290
And so we see this mechanism for
types of behavior that we know,

00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:19.874
types of things like
why certain memories,

00:20:19.874 --> 00:20:22.290
certain emotionally salient
memories last for a long time,

00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:23.460
and others don't.

00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:28.820
And we can also
imagine that this

00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:30.630
is a physiological
process, and that it

00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:33.640
can go wrong, occasionally.

00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:35.520
We all know that
memories are degraded,

00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:38.267
sometimes intentionally so,
sometimes unintentionally so,

00:20:38.267 --> 00:20:40.350
that there are certain
things we want to remember.

00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:43.060
And despite any and all
repetition about glutamate

00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:44.540
being the excitatory
transmitter,

00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:45.850
we just don't remember them.

00:20:45.850 --> 00:20:50.240
And there are some that just
kind of fade away into time,

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:51.950
into the oceans.

00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:54.910
And what is happening
is that there

00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:58.680
are mechanisms for
intentional disruption of LTP.

00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:00.330
And you can think of a few.

00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:05.190
So hypoglycemic states, if
you are really, really hungry,

00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:09.624
you get insulin cascades
that end up reducing LTP.

00:21:09.624 --> 00:21:11.290
If you're starving,
it's not a good time

00:21:11.290 --> 00:21:12.476
to try to remember things.

00:21:12.476 --> 00:21:13.850
It's a good time
to try to go out

00:21:13.850 --> 00:21:15.925
and expend energy finding food.

00:21:15.925 --> 00:21:17.300
As we'll learn
later in lectures,

00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:19.400
there are some stress hormones.

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:21.680
And these stress
hormones actually

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:25.420
give us a selective memory
advantage in the short term.

00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:28.050
If you're in a car crash,
you remember the slow motion

00:21:28.050 --> 00:21:30.084
details of the entire event.

00:21:30.084 --> 00:21:32.000
And this has to do with
these stress hormones,

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.650
these fear hormones
coming out and saying,

00:21:34.650 --> 00:21:37.460
OK, well, we want to be
able to remember this moment

00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:40.450
so we can learn from it
next time, if we survive.

00:21:40.450 --> 00:21:44.140
But if you do this chronically,
if you do this for a long time

00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:47.120
window throughout the
lifetime of the organism,

00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:50.560
then you can actually get damage
to LTP and damage to memory.

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:51.870
So it's about time window.

00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:54.240
It's about the same
mechanisms that

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:57.225
can enhance memory can also
be deleterious eventually.

00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:05.290
Another probably
more familiar one,

00:22:05.290 --> 00:22:08.170
perhaps not to the
introverts, but perhaps

00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:09.630
to the extroverts
in the crowd, is

00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:12.980
that if this lecture
were on Saturday morning,

00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:15.440
I could probably ask you
guys what you did last night.

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:17.490
And some of you would
not be able to tell me

00:22:17.490 --> 00:22:21.920
with delicate accuracy
what happened on Friday.

00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:24.720
And you might not be
able to tell me the story

00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:26.820
that was read to you
at bedtime, or even

00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:28.900
who read you the
story at bedtime.

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:35.890
And this is because ethanol,
alcohol, directly disrupts LTP.

00:22:35.890 --> 00:22:36.660
And we see this.

00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:37.930
And we see this in
the hippocampus.

00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:39.805
And these are the types
of things, behaviors,

00:22:39.805 --> 00:22:41.120
that we know of.

00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:43.860
We know that emotionally
salient memories last longer.

00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:46.540
We know that alcohol
somewhat-- there

00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:50.392
are differential effects of
types of substances on memory.

00:22:50.392 --> 00:22:52.350
We know that it's hard
to remember things right

00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:53.660
before we go to sleep.

00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:55.570
And so what's
interesting is, can we

00:22:55.570 --> 00:22:58.740
get at a physiology that
explains all of these things?

00:23:01.601 --> 00:23:03.850
And so I'm going to give you
60 more seconds-- there's

00:23:03.850 --> 00:23:05.266
going to be a pop
quiz at the end,

00:23:05.266 --> 00:23:07.960
by the way-- you have 60
more seconds to do this.

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:13.680
And what is interesting here
is that when we get down

00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:16.050
to these physiological
mechanisms,

00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:17.510
we have two ends of a spectrum.

00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:20.750
We have HM and we have
Stephen Wiltshire,

00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:23.630
someone who cannot form
any memories whatsoever,

00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:27.570
and then someone who can do this
in a 20-minute helicopter ride,

00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:29.180
recreate the entire landscape.

00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:31.170
And the question is,
the theme of this class

00:23:31.170 --> 00:23:33.400
is often one of
individual variation.

00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:36.820
How is it that
one person can not

00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:38.850
be able to form any
memories whatsoever?

00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:40.510
How is it that one
person can have

00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:42.750
an autistic,
photographic memory?

00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:45.270
And where do we fit?

00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:50.770
Where does memory fit in a
properly functioning way?

00:23:50.770 --> 00:23:53.880
And like most of
the spectrums that

00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:56.760
are introduced into
this class, one

00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:59.600
of imprinted genes, tournament
versus pair-bonding species,

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:01.650
things like that, the
answer turns out to be we

00:24:01.650 --> 00:24:05.060
are somewhere in the
middle between HM,

00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:07.150
no hippocampi, no
formation of new memories,

00:24:07.150 --> 00:24:09.480
and Stephen Wiltshire.

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:16.560
So one more thing
we need to discuss

00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:19.620
with the theme of this
class is that often, we'll

00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:21.870
give you a lecture and then
maybe in the next lecture,

00:24:21.870 --> 00:24:25.440
maybe five minutes later,
we'll tell you it's all wrong.

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:28.230
Or we'll say, no, you've
been way too myopic.

00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:30.640
That's not how you
should see these things.

00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:33.370
And what we need to do in
order to understand somewhat

00:24:33.370 --> 00:24:36.700
about the context of memories
is to take and expand

00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:39.920
your myopic view of this
simplified version of a neuron.

00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:43.680
So far, we've gone into
what a single neuron

00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:45.780
functioning looks like.

00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:48.560
And we've gone into what a
single neuron as it transmits

00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:51.250
a signal to another
neuron looks like,

00:24:51.250 --> 00:24:54.320
how there's a gap in between the
pre and the postsynaptic cell,

00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:56.730
and what that information
transfer looks like,

00:24:56.730 --> 00:24:59.080
and how we can change that
information transfer, how

00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:00.650
we can make it plastic.

00:25:00.650 --> 00:25:03.860
But there's a
problem here, which

00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:06.670
is that if we're trying to
learn anything about the brain,

00:25:06.670 --> 00:25:10.700
we have to understand that the
brain is really complicated,

00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:13.110
and that there's
100 billion neurons,

00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:16.350
and that sometimes these
individual neurons will connect

00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:18.800
to 10,000 other neurons.

00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:21.300
And sometimes, each of
those 10,000 neurons

00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:24.300
will have 10,000 neurons
that connected to it.

00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:29.800
And so the question--
I don't know.

00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:32.570
As a neuroscientist, when I look
at that, the first thing I do

00:25:32.570 --> 00:25:33.650
is want to give up.

00:25:33.650 --> 00:25:35.270
And I do.

00:25:35.270 --> 00:25:39.940
And then the second
thought is OK, maybe

00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:42.500
it's time to expand
the simplified version

00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:43.860
of the neuron that we have.

00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:46.200
It's not just one neuron
talking to another neuron.

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:48.710
It's not just a single
synapse, but that it's

00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:52.180
the dynamics of many,
many interacting neurons.

00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:59.420
And as these dynamics
expand, as these dynamics

00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:02.440
get introduced into 10,000
neurons at the same time,

00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:04.920
10,000 dendrites,
dendritic arbors

00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:08.420
connecting to 10,000
other axonal processes,

00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:10.950
then we see that things
that didn't matter

00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:13.217
so much in the single,
individual neuron actually

00:26:13.217 --> 00:26:14.800
matter quite a bit
when you're talking

00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:17.150
about 100 billion neurons.

00:26:17.150 --> 00:26:20.590
So one of the things
to introduce here

00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:24.880
is the concept of noise into
the individual signal transfer,

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:26.930
into the individual
information transfer.

00:26:26.930 --> 00:26:30.190
A neuron, as we
presented it, was

00:26:30.190 --> 00:26:32.810
something that fires
an action potential,

00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:34.030
transmits information.

00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:35.780
Every single action
potential leads

00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:37.480
to neurotransmitter
release, which

00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:40.160
leads to postsynaptic response.

00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:43.300
But these are very
delicate things.

00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:45.690
An individual
neuron is constantly

00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:48.340
in flux with how much
current is coming in and out.

00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:50.330
Ions are flowing around.

00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:54.140
It's not as simple as
a static neuron that

00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:56.330
then gets activated,
and then passes on

00:26:56.330 --> 00:26:58.530
a message to another
static neuron, which

00:26:58.530 --> 00:26:59.670
then gets activated.

00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:01.680
What you get is
often, a lot of times,

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:05.270
you'll get random and
spontaneous generation

00:27:05.270 --> 00:27:09.370
of signal, of action potentials,
and sometimes of current

00:27:09.370 --> 00:27:11.070
in the postsynaptic cell.

00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:15.060
And one of the major
tasks of the brain

00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:20.310
is figuring out
what is signal, what

00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:25.490
is appropriate and meaningful
signal, versus what

00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:26.330
is this noise.

00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:28.600
If you can imagine on
a single neural level,

00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:30.450
the noise might not
have that much impact.

00:27:30.450 --> 00:27:33.290
But if you're talking
about 100 billion neurons,

00:27:33.290 --> 00:27:36.790
you're going to get noise all
over the place that will just

00:27:36.790 --> 00:27:40.432
lead to this static of noise
that you don't know what

00:27:40.432 --> 00:27:41.640
to make of the world anymore.

00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:43.389
You don't know what
to make of the signal.

00:27:43.389 --> 00:27:48.090
You don't know what to make
of individual neural signals.

00:27:48.090 --> 00:27:52.540
And so what we need to do is
to start considering neurons

00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:58.180
in terms of how they interact
in dynamics of groups.

00:27:58.180 --> 00:28:01.110
And one of the first ways
and the most important ways

00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:04.080
to think about this
is to understand

00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:07.610
that neurons are not just
excitatory forces, that

00:28:07.610 --> 00:28:10.410
information, yes, is
generated by glutamate

00:28:10.410 --> 00:28:14.650
and the transfer of
excitation, but that neurons

00:28:14.650 --> 00:28:18.310
have a capability to inhibit.

00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:23.330
And one of the important ways
that they differentiate signal

00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:26.340
from noise, one of the important
ways to learn what is noise

00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:29.280
and what is not, is to inhibit.

00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:30.717
And I'll explain
how it is exactly

00:28:30.717 --> 00:28:31.800
that the inhibition works.

00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:34.510
But one of the first--
oh, that's pretty high.

00:28:34.510 --> 00:28:36.440
One of the first
ones to understand

00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:43.162
is that a neuron can inhibit
itself, which is not really--

00:28:43.162 --> 00:28:45.620
it seems like it could initially
be some sort of masochism,

00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:46.650
but it's really not.

00:28:46.650 --> 00:28:50.270
It's just that the neuron
is trying to sharpen

00:28:50.270 --> 00:28:51.940
the signal that it's sending.

00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:54.490
So a neuron is firing
and firing, over and over

00:28:54.490 --> 00:28:56.440
and over, and what
it wants to say,

00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:59.600
what it wants to be able
to do, is accurately give

00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:04.620
a precise description of the
signal, of the information.

00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:07.900
And what it can do is inhibit
itself to say, I'm done.

00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:09.360
No more spontaneous noise.

00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:12.220
No more spontaneous
little bits of current.

00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:14.380
I am done with my signal.

00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:17.530
And what this is, is it allows
for temporal sharpening.

00:29:17.530 --> 00:29:21.270
It allows for the ability
of a neuron to say,

00:29:21.270 --> 00:29:22.230
this was my signal.

00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:23.070
It was meaningful.

00:29:23.070 --> 00:29:26.490
I really meant it,
and inhibit the kinds

00:29:26.490 --> 00:29:30.290
of random noise and spontaneous
things that could happen.

00:29:30.290 --> 00:29:32.780
Another type of
inhibition that's

00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:36.030
very important to separate
noise from not noise

00:29:36.030 --> 00:29:37.480
is spatial inhibition.

00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:40.830
So what this is, is
your individual neuron,

00:29:40.830 --> 00:29:45.460
not only can it send
processes and inhibit itself,

00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:48.760
it can actually send processes
out and inhibit its neighbors.

00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:55.400
And how might this be useful and
important is that it can say,

00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:58.989
essentially, OK,
this signal is real.

00:29:58.989 --> 00:30:00.530
This signal is the
signal that I want

00:30:00.530 --> 00:30:02.990
to send, the information
that I want to transfer.

00:30:02.990 --> 00:30:05.600
And not only that,
ignore my neighbors.

00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:07.830
It's really me.

00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:12.500
And what this allows you to
do is get spatial sharpening.

00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:18.470
So what this allows you to do
is say, in the field of things

00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:21.260
that you're trying to
perceive, a certain neuron

00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:25.460
will respond to a certain
section of that field.

00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:29.930
And what this is saying
is, I am activated.

00:30:29.930 --> 00:30:31.720
And you inhibit
your neighbors so

00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:34.310
that you're more sure
that your signal is true.

00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:36.880
And how can we relate this?

00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:38.620
How can we make sense of this?

00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:43.270
There's a very simple
type of feedback network

00:30:43.270 --> 00:30:46.770
that should elaborate
this idea, which

00:30:46.770 --> 00:30:48.590
is pain and pain sensation.

00:30:48.590 --> 00:30:51.370
And so we all probably, at
some point in our lives,

00:30:51.370 --> 00:30:54.420
presumably, have
discovered and felt pain.

00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:58.210
And there's two general
qualities of pain.

00:30:58.210 --> 00:31:00.310
You can have really,
really fast, sharp pain.

00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:02.830
And you can have this dull,
aching, throbbing pain.

00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:05.330
And what people found
when they investigate

00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:08.110
into your spinal cord and
into your sensory peripheral

00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:10.750
processes is how this
pain is generated.

00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:13.850
And it's generated on two
separate types of neurons.

00:31:13.850 --> 00:31:17.410
And one carries fast pain, one
carries the sharp, fast stuff.

00:31:17.410 --> 00:31:20.280
One carries the
slow, dull stuff.

00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:24.090
And what you find is that
these are intertwined

00:31:24.090 --> 00:31:26.470
in this delicate
feedback loop, such

00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:33.500
that the fast, spiking,
first pain will generate,

00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:35.720
eventually, the
slow-moving pain.

00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:39.660
It will fire the other neurons
next to it, the neighbors,

00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:42.960
and say, OK, also start
this slow pain spike.

00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:45.870
But then the slow pain
spike can come back

00:31:45.870 --> 00:31:52.840
and inhibit the first sharp
spike, such that it stops.

00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:54.840
We're trying to get
information about the world.

00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:56.972
And your body is
trying to do what

00:31:56.972 --> 00:31:58.180
it can with that information.

00:31:58.180 --> 00:32:00.530
And if you get
stung by something,

00:32:00.530 --> 00:32:02.250
you want really sharp
pain to be like,

00:32:02.250 --> 00:32:03.375
hey, pay attention to that.

00:32:03.375 --> 00:32:05.750
Make sure it's not a
scorpion that's still there.

00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:07.749
But you don't need this
sharp pain forever.

00:32:07.749 --> 00:32:10.040
You want to be able to inhibit
it and just say, OK, pay

00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:10.870
attention.

00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:12.884
But then, just to make
sure you don't walk on it

00:32:12.884 --> 00:32:14.300
anymore and get
it infected, we're

00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:15.940
going to make it
hurt a little bit.

00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:18.440
And so this is your body
trying to make the most

00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:19.750
of this type of information.

00:32:19.750 --> 00:32:22.300
And what it's doing is
using lateral inhibition

00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:25.040
in this complicated way,
actually simple way,

00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:33.740
to allow for these two types of
transmissions of information.

00:32:33.740 --> 00:32:35.130
That was a very simple example.

00:32:35.130 --> 00:32:37.970
And I think there's a much
more complex example when

00:32:37.970 --> 00:32:42.860
we go into the types of
complex visual stimuli

00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:45.360
that vision gives us.

00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:49.980
And you can imagine that lateral
inhibition, the same type

00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:52.074
of spatial sharpening
of a signal,

00:32:52.074 --> 00:32:54.490
can come into play as we're
trying to figure out and piece

00:32:54.490 --> 00:32:55.840
together the visual world.

00:32:55.840 --> 00:33:00.680
So what this is doing, what
this kind of lateral inhibition

00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:05.640
allows for, is it allows for
visual neurons to receive input

00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:09.040
and then to say, it is me.

00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:10.860
This is the signal
that I want to send.

00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:13.710
Not only that,
inhibit the neighbors.

00:33:13.710 --> 00:33:16.150
And what this leads to
is this emergent property

00:33:16.150 --> 00:33:19.890
of these retinal
cells that allow

00:33:19.890 --> 00:33:23.500
for specific types
of signal and allow

00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:26.290
for specific types
of receptive fields.

00:33:26.290 --> 00:33:31.020
So in your eyes, your neurons
in the back of your eyes,

00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:32.830
if you just stand
still, they only

00:33:32.830 --> 00:33:35.600
have a certain angle of
light that they can get.

00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:38.740
And that idea is this
idea of receptive fields,

00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:41.580
that they are responsible
for that field.

00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:43.194
And they're
responsible for saying,

00:33:43.194 --> 00:33:45.110
if there's a signal
there, this is what it is.

00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:46.720
And this is how it's relevant.

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:51.180
And what this type of lateral
inhibition allows you to do

00:33:51.180 --> 00:33:52.435
is it allows you to say, OK.

00:33:55.450 --> 00:33:57.670
Your neuron gets
a signal, and it

00:33:57.670 --> 00:33:59.780
wants to say, OK,
that's an edge, an edge

00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:01.740
detection, contrast detection.

00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:03.860
If you look around at
the objects in the room,

00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:07.630
often you define
them by their edges.

00:34:07.630 --> 00:34:10.650
So we have this elaborated
neural mechanism

00:34:10.650 --> 00:34:12.310
involving inhibition
and excitation

00:34:12.310 --> 00:34:15.312
that allows for this type
of contrast enhancement.

00:34:18.469 --> 00:34:25.730
And what can we do
with this even more?

00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:30.900
So these guys Hubel
and Wiesel decided

00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:34.770
that they were going to look--
OK, another brief anecdote.

00:34:34.770 --> 00:34:37.760
So there's this commercial
when I was young.

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:40.040
And it was Michelin Tires.

00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:42.989
And if any of you guys ever
become marketing people,

00:34:42.989 --> 00:34:45.550
which there's enough of you that
statistically, someone will.

00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:48.340
I don't know why you
don't make commercials

00:34:48.340 --> 00:34:51.540
that are scary, because this
commercial frightened me.

00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:52.620
And I was, like, six.

00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:54.030
And I remember it to this day.

00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:56.405
So why not, if you want someone
to remember your product,

00:34:56.405 --> 00:34:58.517
just make it-- take
what you know from this,

00:34:58.517 --> 00:34:59.850
and use it to manipulate people.

00:34:59.850 --> 00:35:01.640
That's what education is.

00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:04.690
And so I remember
this commercial.

00:35:04.690 --> 00:35:06.860
And I just remember it
was for Michelin Tires.

00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:08.960
And their whole point was
that no matter how fancy

00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:11.550
your car is, no matter how
much you spend on your car,

00:35:11.550 --> 00:35:13.210
there's only four
points of contact

00:35:13.210 --> 00:35:15.530
between you and the road.

00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:16.740
And it's on your tires.

00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:19.323
And I don't know why, but this
blew my mind, and it scared me.

00:35:19.323 --> 00:35:21.040
And it made me recognize
that, yeah, you

00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:23.590
should get good tires.

00:35:23.590 --> 00:35:28.750
So Hubel and Wiesel, they took
essentially the same logic,

00:35:28.750 --> 00:35:31.770
which is that we have this
complicated visual world,

00:35:31.770 --> 00:35:34.500
and we know that we put
it together somehow,

00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:36.310
but our only access
to this information

00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:37.930
is through the retina.

00:35:37.930 --> 00:35:41.470
We have the light is the road.

00:35:41.470 --> 00:35:42.580
These are our two tires.

00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:46.340
We only have two tires
to connect with the road.

00:35:46.340 --> 00:35:49.010
And so their logic
was that if we

00:35:49.010 --> 00:35:52.130
look at each individual
neuron in the retina

00:35:52.130 --> 00:35:55.180
and trace it back, we should
be able to see, somehow,

00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:57.080
how this visual
world is constructed,

00:35:57.080 --> 00:36:00.100
how it is that we go from the
only signal, the only signal

00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:01.530
from the outside
world we get, to

00:36:01.530 --> 00:36:04.150
this complicated visual field.

00:36:04.150 --> 00:36:09.230
And what they found
was that if you

00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:12.110
look at the neurons in
the back of a retina,

00:36:12.110 --> 00:36:16.620
and then look at where
they synapse, back

00:36:16.620 --> 00:36:18.870
in your visual
cortex, they found

00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:21.800
a one-to-one correspondence,
that if you activate

00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:23.800
a certain neuron in
your retina, you'll

00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:27.450
get a spatiotopic-- which
means they're oriented

00:36:27.450 --> 00:36:29.380
in the same way,
and all the neurons

00:36:29.380 --> 00:36:32.470
are aligned in a
similar way-- field

00:36:32.470 --> 00:36:34.804
in the back of your
visual cortex, in V1.

00:36:34.804 --> 00:36:36.220
And so what that
essentially means

00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:39.540
is that your eyes are smushed
to the back your head.

00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:43.170
There's no information that
necessarily gets enhanced

00:36:43.170 --> 00:36:46.060
or reduced between your
retina and the back

00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:47.120
of your visual field.

00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:49.040
And they're like, OK, great.

00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:54.200
And so these guys, Hubel and
Wiesel, won the Nobel Prize.

00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:56.140
If you could win more
than one, they probably

00:36:56.140 --> 00:36:57.600
would have won four by now.

00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:01.590
They were these Harvard
neuroscientist back in the day.

00:37:01.590 --> 00:37:06.660
And they are pretty much
who you need to know.

00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:08.160
You need to know Hebb.

00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:10.070
You need to
understand glutamate.

00:37:10.070 --> 00:37:11.390
You need to understand LTP.

00:37:11.390 --> 00:37:14.114
And Hubel and Wiesel, if you're
going to be a neuroscientist,

00:37:14.114 --> 00:37:16.030
be interested in the
brain, they will come up.

00:37:16.030 --> 00:37:18.530
And if you're a
neuroscientist, you

00:37:18.530 --> 00:37:20.195
have to invite them
to your wedding.

00:37:20.195 --> 00:37:21.479
You have to do everything.

00:37:21.479 --> 00:37:23.770
I don't even know if they're--
they might even be dead.

00:37:23.770 --> 00:37:27.410
You have to seance
them, or something.

00:37:27.410 --> 00:37:31.300
But what they decided to do
was then, OK, now we're at V1.

00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:34.040
We're at the one level
of visual cortex.

00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:35.880
What else can we do?

00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:38.430
Where does the scene get
constructed that we see?

00:37:38.430 --> 00:37:41.454
And what they did was
looked one layer up.

00:37:41.454 --> 00:37:42.870
And they did the
exact same thing.

00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:45.370
They fired individual
retinal neurons.

00:37:45.370 --> 00:37:49.270
And they looked in
the next layer up.

00:37:49.270 --> 00:37:50.720
And absolutely nothing happened.

00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:53.150
There was no activity anywhere,
no matter what they did.

00:37:53.150 --> 00:37:55.460
It fired all of them, and
there was no activity.

00:37:55.460 --> 00:37:57.580
And they were like, oh, damn it.

00:37:57.580 --> 00:38:00.470
We're not going to get
invited to any weddings.

00:38:00.470 --> 00:38:01.770
What are we going to do?

00:38:01.770 --> 00:38:06.200
But what they discovered
was that if you activated

00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:08.300
enough retinal
neurons, and that they

00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:12.170
were in a certain spatial
orientation, say a line,

00:38:12.170 --> 00:38:15.000
then you get activation
in this other layer

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:16.680
of your visual cortex.

00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:19.580
And what they discovered,
and what was on, I'm sure,

00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:22.360
the construction of all of
their wedding invitations,

00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:26.660
was that if you have
certain neurons that

00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:31.120
are selective to certain
orientations of lines, like so,

00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:33.340
if you imagine these
are four neurons,

00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:36.770
a single neuron will be
responsive to a vertical line.

00:38:36.770 --> 00:38:39.190
A single neuron, another
one, a different one,

00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:42.550
will be responsive
to a 45-degree angle,

00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:45.020
a horizontal line, 135 degrees.

00:38:45.020 --> 00:38:50.250
And so what you get, and you're
starting to piece together,

00:38:50.250 --> 00:38:53.880
is this way of constructing the
visual world that is layered,

00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:58.480
and that extracts out features,
and that through those features

00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:01.690
you get individual
neural activation.

00:39:01.690 --> 00:39:05.220
And you might imagine that
if you go up even further,

00:39:05.220 --> 00:39:08.040
you would get some sort
of more higher order

00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:10.660
types of activation,
individual activation,

00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:14.000
in your visual cortex, something
like, say, a neuron that only

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.820
responds to an orange, or
a neuron that only responds

00:39:16.820 --> 00:39:18.640
to a banana, or a
neuron that-- so this

00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:20.510
is one of the terms
in the field--

00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:22.277
only responds to
your grandmother.

00:39:22.277 --> 00:39:23.860
And they call it a
grandmother neuron.

00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:25.484
And there's this kind
of El Dorado type

00:39:25.484 --> 00:39:27.830
quest for grandmother neuron.

00:39:27.830 --> 00:39:29.430
Where can we find it?

00:39:29.430 --> 00:39:31.655
And the problem is,
nobody ever found it.

00:39:34.730 --> 00:39:37.150
So then the question
becomes, again,

00:39:37.150 --> 00:39:39.380
related to memory, related
to even our understanding

00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:42.750
of these kind of
networks of neurons.

00:39:42.750 --> 00:39:45.565
Where are these memories stored?

00:39:52.850 --> 00:39:54.100
This is slightly out of order.

00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:57.930
But basically, this is
an example of, again,

00:39:57.930 --> 00:39:59.660
your lateral inhibition.

00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:03.289
So to understand how it is that
these signals are sharpened,

00:40:03.289 --> 00:40:04.580
this is a nice visual illusion.

00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:09.120
Do you guys see little dots
of dark between each of those?

00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:10.070
That is an artifact.

00:40:10.070 --> 00:40:11.986
That is an artifact of
your visual perception.

00:40:11.986 --> 00:40:15.900
That is an artifact of
you constructing that.

00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:16.997
And why is that happening?

00:40:16.997 --> 00:40:18.830
Because at each of those
individual corners,

00:40:18.830 --> 00:40:20.630
you're getting the
most amount, because

00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:25.440
of the four axial bars of
white, of lateral inhibition.

00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:27.580
So in every single one
of your brains right now,

00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:29.954
whenever you look at
the individual corner,

00:40:29.954 --> 00:40:31.370
you're getting
lateral inhibition.

00:40:31.370 --> 00:40:34.860
And so you can imagine
that this type of thing

00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:37.520
is a demonstration of
lateral inhibition.

00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:41.546
Another type of thing, when
I was talking about pain,

00:40:41.546 --> 00:40:43.420
there's this fascinating
thing where-- we all

00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:45.350
know this-- where if
something itches, say,

00:40:45.350 --> 00:40:46.730
you have a mosquito bite.

00:40:46.730 --> 00:40:49.290
And you want to scratch
the hell out of it,

00:40:49.290 --> 00:40:50.970
because sometimes it
feels really good.

00:40:50.970 --> 00:40:54.230
You notice also that you
can scratch around it.

00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:57.940
You can make hard,
kind of painful stimuli

00:40:57.940 --> 00:40:59.890
in the immediate
vicinity, and just

00:40:59.890 --> 00:41:01.590
do it really,
really hard enough.

00:41:01.590 --> 00:41:03.337
And you get lessening of pain.

00:41:03.337 --> 00:41:05.170
And what that is, is
the same type of thing.

00:41:05.170 --> 00:41:08.650
It's lateral inhibition of the
focal point of the mosquito

00:41:08.650 --> 00:41:09.490
bite.

00:41:09.490 --> 00:41:11.296
And so these things
sound abstract,

00:41:11.296 --> 00:41:12.670
but these things
really are real.

00:41:12.670 --> 00:41:16.770
And we can see them,
and we can feel them,

00:41:16.770 --> 00:41:18.760
if we know where to look.

00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:21.910
So one last idea.

00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:23.780
We're trying to
get at, OK, where

00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:24.950
are these memories stored?

00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:25.890
Where are these facts?

00:41:25.890 --> 00:41:29.870
Where is what you know now
about neurobiology stored?

00:41:29.870 --> 00:41:37.310
And it's helpful to introduce
the idea of neural networks.

00:41:37.310 --> 00:41:39.890
There's 100 billion
neurons in the brain.

00:41:39.890 --> 00:41:42.440
These are not
communicating one to one.

00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:45.210
These are communicating
with tens of thousands

00:41:45.210 --> 00:41:47.060
of other types of neurons.

00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:49.780
And if you simplify this
down to just the basic idea

00:41:49.780 --> 00:41:52.800
of a neural network,
such that you

00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:56.220
have your bottom,
first layer cells.

00:41:56.220 --> 00:41:59.960
And these first layer cells
respond to, respectively, left

00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:03.540
to right, Monet, Cezanne, Degas.

00:42:03.540 --> 00:42:04.290
They just respond.

00:42:04.290 --> 00:42:06.050
For some reason,
they have been tuned.

00:42:06.050 --> 00:42:08.870
They have undergone LTP.

00:42:08.870 --> 00:42:11.800
That is what they respond to
in this very one-to-one Hubel

00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:14.650
and Wiesel kind of way.

00:42:14.650 --> 00:42:17.780
But what we notice is that
there's this elaborate property

00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:20.750
you get when you start
to combine neurons

00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:23.010
with many, many other
types of neurons, which

00:42:23.010 --> 00:42:24.340
is that you get a network.

00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:27.060
And you get a network without
one-to-one correspondence.

00:42:27.060 --> 00:42:29.710
So if you look at the top
row, and you get neurons A

00:42:29.710 --> 00:42:34.130
through E, A still responds
in this one-to-one way,

00:42:34.130 --> 00:42:35.850
with just Monet.

00:42:35.850 --> 00:42:39.150
E, again, you got just Degas.

00:42:39.150 --> 00:42:41.210
So those are not really
informative in the way

00:42:41.210 --> 00:42:43.940
in which we want to understand
the emergent property,

00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:46.654
and what's important
about neural networks.

00:42:46.654 --> 00:42:48.070
What we get out
of neural networks

00:42:48.070 --> 00:42:52.220
is emphasized when
we focus on C. Neuron

00:42:52.220 --> 00:42:57.080
C doesn't know-- if it gets
activated, what can you tell?

00:42:57.080 --> 00:43:00.880
You don't know which
input it came from.

00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:03.470
You don't know whether it came
from the first-layer neuron

00:43:03.470 --> 00:43:05.230
1, first-layer neuron 2, or 3.

00:43:05.230 --> 00:43:09.140
You don't know whether or not it
was a Monet, Cezanne, or Degas.

00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:11.810
All you know is that
it's one of those three.

00:43:11.810 --> 00:43:14.360
And what you get
now is this idea

00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:17.870
that you can have concepts,
and you can have categories.

00:43:17.870 --> 00:43:20.866
And you can have a
category of impressionism.

00:43:20.866 --> 00:43:22.240
That doesn't
necessarily give you

00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:26.010
information about individual
types or names, or which

00:43:26.010 --> 00:43:27.160
neuron it came from.

00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:29.430
But you have a
network of neurons

00:43:29.430 --> 00:43:31.160
with different concepts in it.

00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:35.340
And amidst this
network, you can now

00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:39.590
understand how it is that
environment and context can

00:43:39.590 --> 00:43:43.330
impinge on the storage
and retrieval of facts.

00:43:43.330 --> 00:43:51.580
So the idea that emotionally
salient memories are longer

00:43:51.580 --> 00:43:55.330
lived in your brain, in your
synapses, in your plasticity,

00:43:55.330 --> 00:43:57.650
than other ones,
well, how is that true

00:43:57.650 --> 00:44:00.040
if they're not contextually
related, if the mechanism is

00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:01.290
the same everywhere?

00:44:01.290 --> 00:44:05.340
But what you begin to see is
that if you combine context

00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:08.150
in this version of
neural networks,

00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:12.190
you start to get the neural
representation of context,

00:44:12.190 --> 00:44:14.170
the neural representation
of environment.

00:44:14.170 --> 00:44:16.220
And this makes sense
if you think about how

00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:17.665
we try to remember things.

00:44:17.665 --> 00:44:19.040
If you try to
remember something,

00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:20.831
and you know it's an
impressionist painter,

00:44:20.831 --> 00:44:22.570
or you know it's
within a category,

00:44:22.570 --> 00:44:24.930
but you're not quite
there, you kind of

00:44:24.930 --> 00:44:29.100
take a tour of categorical
ways of thinking

00:44:29.100 --> 00:44:31.470
and categorical learning
and categorical objects

00:44:31.470 --> 00:44:34.810
in the world to try to
get at how that one fact,

00:44:34.810 --> 00:44:37.630
that one bit of information
that you're trying to remember.

00:44:37.630 --> 00:44:43.450
So it's not that individual
memories are stored in neurons.

00:44:43.450 --> 00:44:46.260
It's not that they're stored
in the generation of synapses.

00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:51.520
It's not that they are stored
in entirely just the plasticity

00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:53.650
of single synapses.

00:44:53.650 --> 00:44:56.940
It seems that we can
get at and explain

00:44:56.940 --> 00:45:00.160
a lot of these types of
memory by understanding

00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:03.826
that memory is one
aspect of the formation

00:45:03.826 --> 00:45:05.700
of these neural networks,
and that if we have

00:45:05.700 --> 00:45:07.680
100 billion neurons,
we can imagine

00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:13.010
elaborate and complex ways
of designing these things.

00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:14.750
So here we go, one more time.

00:45:14.750 --> 00:45:16.310
Many very different
things happen

00:45:16.310 --> 00:45:18.680
when we remember,
everything down

00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:22.750
from the synaptic
plasticity all the way up

00:45:22.750 --> 00:45:25.940
to this impressionism,
categorical way of thinking

00:45:25.940 --> 00:45:28.180
and remembering about things.

00:45:28.180 --> 00:45:33.360
And what is again
interesting here

00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:35.860
is that you can
imagine-- what we've

00:45:35.860 --> 00:45:40.580
learned about polymorphisms,
genetic individuality

00:45:40.580 --> 00:45:42.590
and variation, that
certain people can have

00:45:42.590 --> 00:45:44.450
different stress responses.

00:45:44.450 --> 00:45:46.780
The person next to you can
have a different response

00:45:46.780 --> 00:45:47.880
to stress than the other person.

00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:49.980
One person will be more
afraid of public speaking

00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:50.896
than the other person.

00:45:50.896 --> 00:45:52.580
One person will
respond a certain way

00:45:52.580 --> 00:45:54.522
based on prenatal,
postnatal environment,

00:45:54.522 --> 00:45:56.980
all these different things,
all these different variations,

00:45:56.980 --> 00:46:01.330
these polymorphisms that lead to
individual and varied behavior.

00:46:01.330 --> 00:46:07.800
And now we can understand that
a polymorphism in how much

00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:10.140
presynaptic glutamate
gets released-- remember,

00:46:10.140 --> 00:46:12.900
glutamate, excitatory--
a polymorphism

00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:16.950
in how strongly your
postsynaptic receptor responds,

00:46:16.950 --> 00:46:20.690
a polymorphism in the ways in
which your neural networks are

00:46:20.690 --> 00:46:23.200
constructed, these types
of individual things,

00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:29.030
which each are their own
variable in your brain's

00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:33.680
construct of memory, can lead
to different and individual ways

00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:34.800
in which we remember.

00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:37.350
Some people are just better
at remembering than others.

00:46:37.350 --> 00:46:42.215
And what we're trying to get
at is from the spectrum of HM,

00:46:42.215 --> 00:46:44.790
who can't remember anything,
to Stephen Wiltshire, who

00:46:44.790 --> 00:46:49.870
can remember this, and where
the genetics and the environment

00:46:49.870 --> 00:46:53.820
impact our individual memory.

00:46:53.820 --> 00:46:55.594
And I think that's it.

00:46:55.594 --> 00:46:57.010
So we'll take a
five minute break.

00:46:57.010 --> 00:46:58.910
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:58.910 --> 00:47:01.590
I'm going to talk to you guys
about the autonomic nervous

00:47:01.590 --> 00:47:02.900
system.

00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:05.440
So basically, autonomic
sounds like automatic.

00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:07.870
This is anything that's
going to happen automatically

00:47:07.870 --> 00:47:11.320
in your body, not quite
the hippocampus, horse,

00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:15.360
like hippodrome-- like
automatic, autonomic.

00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:19.952
So basically, your heart
beating, digesting,

00:47:19.952 --> 00:47:24.241
goosebumps, orgasm, things that
you don't have control over--

00:47:24.241 --> 00:47:24.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:24.740 --> 00:47:26.370
Good stuff, right?

00:47:26.370 --> 00:47:29.940
This is going to be your
autonomic nervous system.

00:47:29.940 --> 00:47:33.020
So first, the nervous
system, remember,

00:47:33.020 --> 00:47:35.830
is split up into the
central and the peripheral.

00:47:35.830 --> 00:47:39.670
So our central nervous system is
our brain and our spinal cord.

00:47:39.670 --> 00:47:41.160
And our peripheral
nervous system

00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:44.310
is everything else
on the periphery.

00:47:44.310 --> 00:47:46.720
And then within that, the
peripheral nervous system

00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:49.590
can be split up into the
somatic nervous system

00:47:49.590 --> 00:47:50.634
and the autonomic.

00:47:50.634 --> 00:47:52.050
So we're going
over the autonomic.

00:47:52.050 --> 00:47:52.785
Remember that.

00:47:52.785 --> 00:47:54.410
But just to tell you
about the somatic,

00:47:54.410 --> 00:47:56.950
that's basically the
voluntary nervous system.

00:47:56.950 --> 00:48:00.360
So if you want to pick
up a pen off the ground,

00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:02.650
your brain says, OK, I
want to pick up a pen.

00:48:02.650 --> 00:48:04.960
Send the message to my muscle.

00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:06.660
Muscle's going to
pick up the pan.

00:48:06.660 --> 00:48:09.910
It's also your
sensory info, so when

00:48:09.910 --> 00:48:13.140
you touch something or
smell something, information

00:48:13.140 --> 00:48:17.010
from the periphery going to
your central nervous system.

00:48:17.010 --> 00:48:18.800
And autonomic
nervous system, what

00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:20.570
we're going to talk
about today, can

00:48:20.570 --> 00:48:23.520
be split up into the
parasympathetic and sympathetic

00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:24.540
nervous systems.

00:48:24.540 --> 00:48:26.340
We'll go over all
those in detail.

00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:29.350
But for right now,
one last comparison

00:48:29.350 --> 00:48:32.100
of the voluntary and autonomic.

00:48:32.100 --> 00:48:36.150
So the voluntary nervous
system, remember, voluntary,

00:48:36.150 --> 00:48:38.050
moves muscles.

00:48:38.050 --> 00:48:41.790
Autonomic, it's involuntary,
moving organs, your heart,

00:48:41.790 --> 00:48:45.040
your digestive
system, your lungs.

00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:48.060
The voluntary nervous
system's actually myelinated.

00:48:48.060 --> 00:48:50.860
So what that means is there's
a myelin sheath covering

00:48:50.860 --> 00:48:53.310
the axon, as you can see there.

00:48:53.310 --> 00:48:54.830
And the action
potential actually

00:48:54.830 --> 00:48:58.140
can speed up and go
down the axon faster.

00:48:58.140 --> 00:49:01.160
And the autonomic nervous
system's actually unmyelinated.

00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:02.399
These are just fun facts.

00:49:02.399 --> 00:49:03.690
So it goes a little bit slower.

00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:08.660
The good stuff, autonomic
nervous system--

00:49:08.660 --> 00:49:11.640
so we have sympathetic
and parasympathetic.

00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:14.240
And sympathetic is
that nervous system

00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:15.650
where you hear fight or flight.

00:49:15.650 --> 00:49:19.560
So anything exciting,
arousal, alertness, emergency,

00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:21.720
like if you have a
hippo chasing after you

00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:25.210
or something, definitely
sympathetic nervous system.

00:49:25.210 --> 00:49:28.590
If you like somebody and are
talking to them first time,

00:49:28.590 --> 00:49:31.380
sympathetic nervous system
activation, you're excited.

00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:35.280
Parasympathetic is more of
the calm, vegetative function.

00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:39.790
So after you have a huge meal,
or when you want to take a nap,

00:49:39.790 --> 00:49:44.730
anything like that, growth,
repair, total relaxation state.

00:49:44.730 --> 00:49:46.750
And as you can see,
they kind of sound

00:49:46.750 --> 00:49:49.600
like they have opposing
functions, because they do.

00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:51.420
And they tend to
work in opposition,

00:49:51.420 --> 00:49:54.179
so it's kind of like
putting your foot on the gas

00:49:54.179 --> 00:49:55.470
and the brake at the same time.

00:49:55.470 --> 00:49:57.970
You can't really do that,
because they're opposing.

00:49:57.970 --> 00:50:00.630
When the parasympathetic
system is on,

00:50:00.630 --> 00:50:04.180
your sympathetic nervous system
is usually off, and vice versa.

00:50:04.180 --> 00:50:08.604
So they work together to keep
our body going automatically.

00:50:08.604 --> 00:50:11.470
OK, sympathetic nervous
system-- so remember,

00:50:11.470 --> 00:50:15.020
this is like that huge animal,
whatever your favorite one is,

00:50:15.020 --> 00:50:16.310
chasing after you.

00:50:16.310 --> 00:50:17.740
What do you do?

00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:19.790
Well, your heart speeds up.

00:50:19.790 --> 00:50:21.530
It's going to beat faster.

00:50:21.530 --> 00:50:22.900
You're going to breathe more.

00:50:22.900 --> 00:50:24.850
You're going to vasoconstrict.

00:50:24.850 --> 00:50:27.390
So what that means is you're
sending the blood-- you're

00:50:27.390 --> 00:50:29.236
basically constricting
your blood vessels

00:50:29.236 --> 00:50:31.610
and sending blood more to your
lungs and to your muscles,

00:50:31.610 --> 00:50:32.752
so you can run away.

00:50:32.752 --> 00:50:35.360
You're going to
inhibit digestion.

00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:37.150
When you're running
away from a hippo,

00:50:37.150 --> 00:50:40.880
you don't care about digesting
the sandwich you just had.

00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:42.240
You're going to sweat.

00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:44.097
Your muscles will
tense, anything

00:50:44.097 --> 00:50:46.430
you would think of when you're
just totally freaked out.

00:50:49.140 --> 00:50:52.560
And the parasympathetic
nervous system-- I

00:50:52.560 --> 00:50:55.140
really like these pictures.

00:50:55.140 --> 00:50:57.570
I found the dog, and
I got super excited.

00:50:57.570 --> 00:51:00.070
And then I found him,
and I wanted to name him,

00:51:00.070 --> 00:51:01.980
but I haven't thought of it yet.

00:51:01.980 --> 00:51:05.580
But basically, they're
resting and digesting.

00:51:05.580 --> 00:51:09.045
They're just taking it
easy, like growth, repair.

00:51:09.045 --> 00:51:11.420
Basically anything you would
do when you're not stressed,

00:51:11.420 --> 00:51:13.000
you have time to do now.

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:14.610
Your immune system
can function well.

00:51:14.610 --> 00:51:17.310
You can spend time
digesting and urinating.

00:51:20.310 --> 00:51:22.290
Sympathetic nervous
system-- So we're

00:51:22.290 --> 00:51:24.910
going to look into the
neurotransmitters involved

00:51:24.910 --> 00:51:26.140
in both the symptoms now.

00:51:26.140 --> 00:51:30.030
So neurons-- what's
being communicated?

00:51:30.030 --> 00:51:33.340
And I know that Pat told
you glutamate's the best.

00:51:33.340 --> 00:51:37.340
But I'm going to fight that and
tell you that norepinephrine

00:51:37.340 --> 00:51:38.790
is one of the good ones, too.

00:51:38.790 --> 00:51:42.140
So basically, you
release norepinephrine

00:51:42.140 --> 00:51:43.920
in the target organs
when you're dealing

00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:45.900
with the sympathetic
nervous system.

00:51:45.900 --> 00:51:47.884
So the hippo coming
at you, what you do

00:51:47.884 --> 00:51:49.634
is you're going to
release norepinephrine,

00:51:49.634 --> 00:51:51.600
NE, onto the target organs.

00:51:51.600 --> 00:51:54.620
And you can see the
organs on the right.

00:51:54.620 --> 00:51:56.274
It affects all of those.

00:51:56.274 --> 00:51:57.440
So it's going to your heart.

00:51:57.440 --> 00:51:59.280
It's going to your lungs.

00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:01.260
It's going to your
kidney, your bladder.

00:52:01.260 --> 00:52:04.110
And it's telling it-- when
it receives norepinephrine,

00:52:04.110 --> 00:52:06.720
those organs know, OK, my
sympathetic nervous system

00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:07.860
is activated.

00:52:07.860 --> 00:52:09.150
I'm going to fight or flight.

00:52:09.150 --> 00:52:10.483
I'm going to run away right now.

00:52:10.483 --> 00:52:13.370
Or I'm going to start-- my
heart's going to beat faster.

00:52:13.370 --> 00:52:17.700
And the one exception is the
sympathetic nervous system

00:52:17.700 --> 00:52:21.190
actually releases
epinephrine in the adrenal.

00:52:21.190 --> 00:52:23.630
And this is just
a cool exception.

00:52:23.630 --> 00:52:27.920
Epinephrine, remember it's one
step away from norepinephrine

00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:29.220
in the biosynthetic pathway.

00:52:29.220 --> 00:52:31.220
So you can make epinephrine
from norepinephrine,

00:52:31.220 --> 00:52:33.770
so they're not really
that different.

00:52:33.770 --> 00:52:38.320
And epinephrine's also
called adrenaline-- adrenal,

00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:42.450
adrenaline, see the resemblance.

00:52:42.450 --> 00:52:45.630
And this is just
another diagram, again,

00:52:45.630 --> 00:52:48.330
showing you norepinephrine
released on the target organ.

00:52:48.330 --> 00:52:50.929
So you think of sympathetic,
you think of norepinephrine.

00:52:50.929 --> 00:52:53.220
And you can see how it will
go and accelerate the heart

00:52:53.220 --> 00:52:55.330
beat, stuff like that.

00:52:55.330 --> 00:52:57.140
And just more in
detail, if you've

00:52:57.140 --> 00:52:59.596
taken bio core-- I don't know
about [INAUDIBLE] bio core,

00:52:59.596 --> 00:53:02.562
but definitely bio core-- you
know that it's not that simple.

00:53:02.562 --> 00:53:04.020
You don't need to
worry about this.

00:53:04.020 --> 00:53:06.530
But there's actually
an intermediate step,

00:53:06.530 --> 00:53:09.390
where the spinal cord
projections actually

00:53:09.390 --> 00:53:13.520
first go to this ganglion, which
then goes to the target organ

00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:15.100
and releases NE there.

00:53:15.100 --> 00:53:16.260
But don't worry about that.

00:53:16.260 --> 00:53:20.260
Just know norepinephrine,
sympathetic.

00:53:20.260 --> 00:53:22.430
Parasympathetic
nervous system-- so we

00:53:22.430 --> 00:53:24.010
have another cool
neurotransmitter

00:53:24.010 --> 00:53:30.190
besides glutamate and NE,
which is acetylcholine, or ACh.

00:53:30.190 --> 00:53:33.990
And the parasympathetic, you see
it goes to all the same organs.

00:53:33.990 --> 00:53:36.880
But now, when it releases
ACh, those organs

00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:40.370
know parasympathetic,
rest and digest.

00:53:40.370 --> 00:53:44.400
I have time to finish my
meal and do everything that I

00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:47.240
can do when I want to relax.

00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:49.650
And again, there is
an intermediate step,

00:53:49.650 --> 00:53:52.860
where you release acetylcholine
first in the target organ.

00:53:52.860 --> 00:53:56.190
And then a second neuron goes,
releases acetylcholine again.

00:53:56.190 --> 00:54:00.300
This [INAUDIBLE]
Ach, parasympathetic.

00:54:00.300 --> 00:54:02.200
And if you want more
details about it,

00:54:02.200 --> 00:54:05.400
too, this slide is
totally extra details.

00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:08.990
But you can see the projections
from the spinal cord

00:54:08.990 --> 00:54:10.540
actually lead from
different places

00:54:10.540 --> 00:54:13.380
in the parasympathetic and the
sympathetic nervous system.

00:54:13.380 --> 00:54:15.700
And you can just see at
the end, acetylcholine

00:54:15.700 --> 00:54:19.640
and norepinephrine
being released.

00:54:19.640 --> 00:54:21.170
So this is a really
important slide.

00:54:21.170 --> 00:54:22.746
That's why I put stars on it.

00:54:22.746 --> 00:54:24.472
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:24.472 --> 00:54:26.180
Even Sapolsky, when
he saw my PowerPoint,

00:54:26.180 --> 00:54:28.138
he was like, spend a lot
of time on that slide.

00:54:28.138 --> 00:54:29.940
So I'm going to.

00:54:29.940 --> 00:54:33.250
So we're going to look at
exactly what happens when

00:54:33.250 --> 00:54:35.600
your parasympathetic or
sympathetic nervous systems

00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:38.810
are activated, and compare
them in different organs.

00:54:38.810 --> 00:54:41.920
So the easiest one to start with
is your cardiovascular system,

00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:43.100
so your heart.

00:54:43.100 --> 00:54:44.930
You're running
away, you're scared,

00:54:44.930 --> 00:54:46.930
or you're meeting someone
new for the first time

00:54:46.930 --> 00:54:48.430
that you really like.

00:54:48.430 --> 00:54:50.800
And your sympathetic
nervous system turns on.

00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:52.560
Your heart's going
to beat faster.

00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:53.600
Remember that.

00:54:53.600 --> 00:54:56.540
So your heart actually
has a myogenic rhythm,

00:54:56.540 --> 00:54:58.990
which means it actually
has a muscle that

00:54:58.990 --> 00:55:00.514
is controlling its beating.

00:55:00.514 --> 00:55:03.180
But what the brain does, and the
sympathetic and parasympathetic

00:55:03.180 --> 00:55:05.180
nervous system does,
is it can change

00:55:05.180 --> 00:55:07.110
how fast the heart beats.

00:55:07.110 --> 00:55:08.610
So your heart's beating faster.

00:55:08.610 --> 00:55:10.100
Your blood pressure
will increase

00:55:10.100 --> 00:55:12.206
when your sympathetic
nervous system is on.

00:55:12.206 --> 00:55:14.080
You're going to
vasoconstrict, remember, send

00:55:14.080 --> 00:55:16.910
the blood to your muscles,
so you can run away and all

00:55:16.910 --> 00:55:17.960
that good stuff.

00:55:17.960 --> 00:55:20.850
And parasympathetic-- opposite.

00:55:20.850 --> 00:55:25.120
Slower heart beat,
vasodilation of the vessels.

00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:28.255
Blood's now going to the
GI tract for digestion,

00:55:28.255 --> 00:55:31.690
and everything like that.

00:55:31.690 --> 00:55:34.330
Another fun example is
the GI tract itself,

00:55:34.330 --> 00:55:37.320
so your gut, your stomach,
your small intestine.

00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:41.460
So basically, parasympathetic
activity, when you're resting,

00:55:41.460 --> 00:55:42.960
you have time to digest.

00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:46.660
So what you do is you
stimulate the secretion

00:55:46.660 --> 00:55:49.180
of the acids and enzymes
needed for digestion.

00:55:49.180 --> 00:55:53.080
You move your small
intestine with a contraction

00:55:53.080 --> 00:55:55.390
called peristalsis.

00:55:55.390 --> 00:55:58.864
And basically, you can go to
the bathroom, and everything

00:55:58.864 --> 00:56:00.530
that you would do
while you're relaxing.

00:56:03.750 --> 00:56:06.520
Sorry.

00:56:06.520 --> 00:56:08.792
So in the heart
and the GI tract,

00:56:08.792 --> 00:56:11.250
you can pretty much see that
they're working in opposition.

00:56:11.250 --> 00:56:13.460
So when the heart beats
up with sympathetic,

00:56:13.460 --> 00:56:15.340
it slows down with
parasympathetic.

00:56:15.340 --> 00:56:18.180
GI, the opposite case,
parasympathetic turns it on,

00:56:18.180 --> 00:56:19.610
speeds up digestion.

00:56:19.610 --> 00:56:21.430
Parasympathetic turns it off.

00:56:21.430 --> 00:56:22.215
I'm sorry.

00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:29.090
This is the important slide.

00:56:29.090 --> 00:56:35.210
So one place where they
actually do work together

00:56:35.210 --> 00:56:38.070
instead of actually
opposing each other

00:56:38.070 --> 00:56:40.230
is in the male
reproductive system.

00:56:40.230 --> 00:56:43.320
And they work together for
you to erect and ejaculate.

00:56:43.320 --> 00:56:47.100
So what happens is in
order to have an erection,

00:56:47.100 --> 00:56:49.000
you have to be stress free.

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:50.860
You can't be worrying
about your test.

00:56:50.860 --> 00:56:54.190
So which one do you think
is in charge of erection,

00:56:54.190 --> 00:56:55.840
parasympathetic or sympathetic?

00:56:55.840 --> 00:56:56.520
Parasympathetic.

00:56:56.520 --> 00:56:57.020
Perfect.

00:56:57.020 --> 00:57:01.120
So parasympathetic activation,
you get an erection.

00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:03.820
Now let's say you
have an erection.

00:57:03.820 --> 00:57:05.929
And now you're with
somebody, maybe.

00:57:05.929 --> 00:57:07.220
I don't know what you're doing.

00:57:07.220 --> 00:57:08.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:08.740 --> 00:57:12.074
Whatever's happening-- sorry.

00:57:15.164 --> 00:57:17.330
All of a sudden, you feel
your heart beating faster.

00:57:17.330 --> 00:57:19.610
You start sweating a little bit.

00:57:19.610 --> 00:57:22.502
Your sympathetic nervous system
is turned on a little bit now.

00:57:22.502 --> 00:57:24.960
So now we have parasympathetic,
we still have our erection.

00:57:24.960 --> 00:57:27.557
But we also have some
sympathetic activity,

00:57:27.557 --> 00:57:29.390
and then more and more
sympathetic activity.

00:57:29.390 --> 00:57:32.370
And all of a sudden, sympathetic
activity completely takes over.

00:57:32.370 --> 00:57:33.456
And what happens?

00:57:33.456 --> 00:57:35.180
You ejaculate, right?

00:57:35.180 --> 00:57:39.820
So parasympathetic-- erection,
sympathetic-- ejaculation.

00:57:39.820 --> 00:57:43.990
And it's actually a cool fact
about erectile dysfunction

00:57:43.990 --> 00:57:48.270
that about 60% of the cases are
due to stress and not actually

00:57:48.270 --> 00:57:50.640
organic basis in your body.

00:57:50.640 --> 00:57:52.750
So if you're stressed
out all of the time,

00:57:52.750 --> 00:57:56.180
your parasympathetic
activity won't turn on,

00:57:56.180 --> 00:57:58.670
so you can't have an erection.

00:57:58.670 --> 00:58:01.210
And also, we can explain
premature ejaculation,

00:58:01.210 --> 00:58:03.810
if you want to to
your friends tonight.

00:58:03.810 --> 00:58:05.882
You can just be like,
well, let's think about it.

00:58:05.882 --> 00:58:08.340
So I have an erection, but I'm
going to ejaculate too soon.

00:58:08.340 --> 00:58:11.940
So parasympathetic transition
to sympathetic transition,

00:58:11.940 --> 00:58:14.320
or the parasympathetic
transition to sympathetic,

00:58:14.320 --> 00:58:19.322
happens too quickly, your
premature ejaculation.

00:58:19.322 --> 00:58:20.790
[LAUGHTER]

00:58:20.790 --> 00:58:23.880
And then health,
so immune system.

00:58:23.880 --> 00:58:26.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:58:26.230 --> 00:58:29.220
When your parasympathetic
system is on,

00:58:29.220 --> 00:58:31.760
you can take care of
your immune system.

00:58:31.760 --> 00:58:33.760
You have the time to make
the white blood cells.

00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:37.515
But when you're chasing away
from a predator or an elephant,

00:58:37.515 --> 00:58:39.890
you really don't care about
making new white blood cells.

00:58:39.890 --> 00:58:43.630
And this could also explain
why it's easier to get sick

00:58:43.630 --> 00:58:44.740
when you're stressed out.

00:58:44.740 --> 00:58:46.450
Your sympathetic
is too much caring

00:58:46.450 --> 00:58:48.418
about your stressful
situation than taking

00:58:48.418 --> 00:58:49.542
care of your immune system.

00:58:52.200 --> 00:58:54.990
I don't know-- oh my
computer goes on sleep.

00:58:54.990 --> 00:58:55.987
I think that's it.

00:58:59.740 --> 00:59:02.350
So again, we see there's
a balance between the two

00:59:02.350 --> 00:59:02.910
branches.

00:59:02.910 --> 00:59:06.140
So sympathetic, you're
running away from a snake.

00:59:06.140 --> 00:59:07.600
When that's on,
parasympathetic's

00:59:07.600 --> 00:59:09.780
off, and vice versa.

00:59:09.780 --> 00:59:14.300
And there's actually a really
cute video that I found.

00:59:16.870 --> 00:59:18.170
And you have to click it twice.

00:59:24.430 --> 00:59:27.084
So the sympathetic
nervous system, this video

00:59:27.084 --> 00:59:29.000
will tell you everything
that I just told you.

00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:32.130
It increases heart
rate, makes your pupils

00:59:32.130 --> 00:59:35.310
dilate so you can see further,
run away from the predator.

00:59:35.310 --> 00:59:36.840
You don't have time to digest.

00:59:36.840 --> 00:59:39.180
You don't care about nasal
secretions right now.

00:59:39.180 --> 00:59:39.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:59:39.800 --> 00:59:41.400
You're not going
to produce saliva.

00:59:41.400 --> 00:59:44.050
Who cares about eating?

00:59:44.050 --> 00:59:47.550
Inhibits the liver,
kidneys, and gall bladder,

00:59:47.550 --> 00:59:48.910
and stimulates sweating.

00:59:48.910 --> 00:59:51.800
We're going to sweat when we're
running away, getting scared.

00:59:51.800 --> 00:59:53.840
Causes piloerection,
so when your hair

00:59:53.840 --> 00:59:55.820
stands when you're nervous.

00:59:55.820 --> 00:59:59.830
Makes the lungs dilate,
you can breathe faster.

00:59:59.830 --> 01:00:03.910
Increases muscle strength
so you can run away,

01:00:03.910 --> 01:00:05.430
and is important for orgasm.

01:00:05.430 --> 01:00:08.430
[LAUGHTER]

01:00:08.430 --> 01:00:10.820
Sorry.

01:00:10.820 --> 01:00:14.780
Parasympathetic, opposite, so it
makes your heart rate go down.

01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:16.032
Pupils are going to contract.

01:00:16.032 --> 01:00:16.990
You're going to digest.

01:00:19.690 --> 01:00:22.218
You're going to like the
nasal secretions now.

01:00:22.218 --> 01:00:23.859
[LAUGHTER]

01:00:23.859 --> 01:00:25.900
You're going to stimulate
the liver, the bladder,

01:00:25.900 --> 01:00:28.270
and the kidneys.

01:00:28.270 --> 01:00:30.172
You constrict your lungs.

01:00:30.172 --> 01:00:32.380
You're going to pay more
attention to your digestion.

01:00:32.380 --> 01:00:36.900
And it's important for sexual
arousal, remember erections.

01:00:36.900 --> 01:00:38.170
You can play it again later.

01:00:44.380 --> 01:00:46.250
So an important
point to make is when

01:00:46.250 --> 01:00:48.630
we think about sympathetic
nervous system,

01:00:48.630 --> 01:00:51.870
we're thinking about arousal,
emergency, fight or flight.

01:00:51.870 --> 01:00:54.130
But that doesn't mean it
always goes to the organ

01:00:54.130 --> 01:00:55.500
and excites it.

01:00:55.500 --> 01:00:58.121
So in the heart,
when norepinephrine

01:00:58.121 --> 01:01:00.370
goes from the sympathetic
nervous system to the heart,

01:01:00.370 --> 01:01:03.220
it does excite the heart
and make it beat faster.

01:01:03.220 --> 01:01:05.040
But when it goes
to the GI tract,

01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:07.334
it inhibits GI tract activity.

01:01:07.334 --> 01:01:09.750
So it's not always excitatory,
it's not always inhibitory.

01:01:09.750 --> 01:01:11.400
It depends on the organ.

01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:12.980
Same with parasympathetic.

01:01:12.980 --> 01:01:15.660
We think of it as being
the slower moving one.

01:01:15.660 --> 01:01:18.540
But in the GI tract,
it does excite it.

01:01:18.540 --> 01:01:20.270
In the heart, it inhibits.

01:01:20.270 --> 01:01:21.500
So what does that mean?

01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:26.190
It means we need two different
receptors on our organs

01:01:26.190 --> 01:01:29.700
that respond to norepinephrine
or acetylcholine.

01:01:29.700 --> 01:01:32.980
So on the heart, for instance,
for norepinephrine, you'll

01:01:32.980 --> 01:01:36.150
have an excitatory
norepinephrine receptor,

01:01:36.150 --> 01:01:38.650
because it will get excited
and make the heart beat faster.

01:01:38.650 --> 01:01:42.400
But in the GI tract, you'll have
an inhibitory norepinephrine

01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:45.330
receptor that will respond to
the sympathetic nervous system

01:01:45.330 --> 01:01:47.070
and slow it down.

01:01:47.070 --> 01:01:48.840
And then for the
parasympathetic,

01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:52.640
you'd have an excitatory ACh
receptor on your GI tract

01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:54.910
to speed it up, to
digest more food.

01:01:54.910 --> 01:01:57.410
And you'll have an
inhibitory ACh receptor

01:01:57.410 --> 01:01:59.250
on the heart to slow it down.

01:01:59.250 --> 01:02:00.910
So just see you
can't always have

01:02:00.910 --> 01:02:02.970
the same receptor
on the same organ,

01:02:02.970 --> 01:02:05.751
or else it wouldn't
respond right.

01:02:05.751 --> 01:02:07.250
And this is just
showing you, again.

01:02:07.250 --> 01:02:10.810
So the heart there, you have
your inhibitory ACh receptor,

01:02:10.810 --> 01:02:12.350
which tells your
heart to slow down.

01:02:12.350 --> 01:02:15.880
Excitatory norepinephrine,
heart speeds up.

01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:19.290
And in the GI tract, if
ACh is coming your way,

01:02:19.290 --> 01:02:21.210
it will attach to the
excitatory receptor,

01:02:21.210 --> 01:02:22.730
and it'll be like, digest.

01:02:22.730 --> 01:02:25.780
And you have the inhibitory
norepinephrine receptor there,

01:02:25.780 --> 01:02:26.520
too.

01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:29.240
So if sympathetic activity
is being stimulated,

01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:33.770
norepinephrine will land there
and will slow down digestion.

01:02:33.770 --> 01:02:36.770
So if you've taken bio core,
if you want to know more--

01:02:36.770 --> 01:02:39.600
there's actually names for all
of these forms of receptors

01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:43.550
that I put there, just in
case you're extra interested.

01:02:43.550 --> 01:02:47.940
But on the heart, I think
the coolest fact about it

01:02:47.940 --> 01:02:48.800
is the beta blocker.

01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:51.440
So the form of the
receptor on the heart that

01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:53.490
responds to the
sympathetic nervous system

01:02:53.490 --> 01:02:55.940
is actually called
a beta receptor.

01:02:55.940 --> 01:02:59.660
And what beta blockers do,
they block the receptor,

01:02:59.660 --> 01:03:00.830
the beta receptor.

01:03:00.830 --> 01:03:02.670
So this is why beta
blockers are used

01:03:02.670 --> 01:03:06.720
for slowing down heart
rate, reducing hypertension.

01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:08.570
It's basically
blocking the effects

01:03:08.570 --> 01:03:10.460
of the sympathetic
nervous system.

01:03:10.460 --> 01:03:13.090
And Pat actually just
told me, which is great,

01:03:13.090 --> 01:03:17.530
that the one drug that's
banned from the Olympics

01:03:17.530 --> 01:03:20.320
are actually beta blockers,
because if you think about it,

01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:23.102
a huge advantage would
be to be less stressed.

01:03:23.102 --> 01:03:24.560
So if they're
blocking the receptor

01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:26.970
on your heart that
responds to stress

01:03:26.970 --> 01:03:28.820
and the sympathetic
nervous system,

01:03:28.820 --> 01:03:30.940
you can see how it could
allow you to relax more.

01:03:30.940 --> 01:03:32.650
So it's a fun fact.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.460
So now we're going to
talk about the regulation

01:03:39.460 --> 01:03:41.540
of the autonomic nervous
system, so what's

01:03:41.540 --> 01:03:44.940
happening in the brain that's
resulting in norepinephrine

01:03:44.940 --> 01:03:47.290
or acetylcholine being released.

01:03:47.290 --> 01:03:50.720
And the center of regulation
is now the hypothalamus.

01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:53.230
So we just talked
about the hippocampus,

01:03:53.230 --> 01:03:55.780
so this is a different area of
the brain, the hypothalamus.

01:03:55.780 --> 01:03:58.360
It's going to be very
important on Monday as well,

01:03:58.360 --> 01:04:01.220
when Tom and Will talk
about the endocrine system,

01:04:01.220 --> 01:04:03.730
because the
hypothalamus directly

01:04:03.730 --> 01:04:06.720
affects the pituitary
gland, which is center

01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:08.190
of your endocrine system.

01:04:08.190 --> 01:04:13.000
So basically, the hypothalamus
here contains the cell bodies,

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:16.580
or is just one synapse away
from all the cell bodies

01:04:16.580 --> 01:04:19.480
that project onto
the target organs,

01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:21.600
from the spinal cord
to the target organs.

01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:25.270
So basically, the hypothalamus
will tell the spinal cord

01:04:25.270 --> 01:04:28.460
what to project onto the organ.

01:04:28.460 --> 01:04:31.650
So an example of this
would be in your heart.

01:04:31.650 --> 01:04:33.810
And this is actually
called the baroreflex.

01:04:33.810 --> 01:04:36.900
And this is just an example of
how your hypothalamus is going

01:04:36.900 --> 01:04:39.550
to help your body
maintain status quo,

01:04:39.550 --> 01:04:42.490
so make sure that your blood
pressure's never too high,

01:04:42.490 --> 01:04:44.400
your heart's beating
at a normal speed.

01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:46.040
So let's say you're
hemorrhaging,

01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:50.530
because I don't know, a
hyena just attacked you.

01:04:50.530 --> 01:04:52.800
That's weird.

01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:54.310
So anyways, you're hemorrhaging.

01:04:54.310 --> 01:04:56.150
And you're losing
a lot of blood,

01:04:56.150 --> 01:04:58.480
so your blood pressure's
going to go way down.

01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:01.040
And you have these receptors
in your blood vessels

01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:03.000
that are called baroreceptors.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.650
And they'll say, OK, blood
pressure's way too low.

01:05:05.650 --> 01:05:06.460
What do I do?

01:05:06.460 --> 01:05:09.400
They're going to send that
info to the hypothalamus--

01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:11.740
remember the hypothalamus,
center of regulation.

01:05:11.740 --> 01:05:13.820
And the hypothalamus
will be in charge

01:05:13.820 --> 01:05:15.520
of sending that
information along

01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:18.960
to the spinal cord, which will
then project onto the heart

01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:20.200
and tell it to beat faster.

01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:22.440
Sympathetic nervous
system will be activated.

01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:24.890
Beat faster, increase
my blood pressure,

01:05:24.890 --> 01:05:26.910
so that you'll make up
for the loss of blood

01:05:26.910 --> 01:05:29.100
that you just had.

01:05:29.100 --> 01:05:31.450
And the opposite would happen
if your blood pressure is

01:05:31.450 --> 01:05:32.870
getting too high or something.

01:05:32.870 --> 01:05:34.620
Maybe the info will
be sent to your brain.

01:05:34.620 --> 01:05:36.890
And then you can
decrease blood pressure

01:05:36.890 --> 01:05:38.770
through the parasympathetic
nervous system.

01:05:41.420 --> 01:05:46.140
So reptiles, everybody kind of
has that hypothalamus control

01:05:46.140 --> 01:05:46.880
of the-- yeah.

01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:48.796
Sorry, I had a question
about the [INAUDIBLE].

01:05:48.796 --> 01:05:50.510
This is kind of a
[INAUDIBLE] question,

01:05:50.510 --> 01:05:53.390
but is it actually stimulating
the sympathetic nervous system?

01:05:53.390 --> 01:05:56.750
Or is it normally stimulating
the parasympathetic and then

01:05:56.750 --> 01:05:59.150
stops the stimulation?

01:05:59.150 --> 01:06:02.100
Oh, because remember,
one's on or off.

01:06:02.100 --> 01:06:06.740
So like which one's normally on?

01:06:06.740 --> 01:06:08.210
Do you guys know?

01:06:08.210 --> 01:06:09.422
Anybody know?

01:06:09.422 --> 01:06:11.776
There's just a baseline
balance [INAUDIBLE].

01:06:11.776 --> 01:06:12.276
Yeah.

01:06:16.860 --> 01:06:21.050
So what about mammals?

01:06:21.050 --> 01:06:22.350
Mammals have emotions.

01:06:22.350 --> 01:06:24.640
And we have an
emotional regulation

01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:27.580
are in our brain that's
called the limbic system.

01:06:27.580 --> 01:06:30.090
And we're going to learn
a whole lecture just

01:06:30.090 --> 01:06:31.719
about the limbic
system in general.

01:06:31.719 --> 01:06:34.260
But basically, it has everything
do with emotions, behaviors,

01:06:34.260 --> 01:06:38.600
memories, all
mammalian type things.

01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:43.570
So now we see this realm where
not just losing all your blood

01:06:43.570 --> 01:06:45.650
can activate or stimulate
the nervous system

01:06:45.650 --> 01:06:48.500
and cause a parasympathetic
or sympathetic response.

01:06:48.500 --> 01:06:51.176
But now just seeing
someone you hate

01:06:51.176 --> 01:06:52.800
can cause a sympathetic
response that's

01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:55.110
very similar to
losing a lot of blood.

01:06:55.110 --> 01:06:56.620
And this is pretty amazing.

01:06:56.620 --> 01:06:59.930
Wildebeests, for instance,
if they see their enemies,

01:06:59.930 --> 01:07:02.560
the info will be sent from
just the smell of their enemies

01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:06.400
to the limbic system, project
onto the hypothalamus, spinal

01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:08.810
cord, to the sympathetic
nervous system,

01:07:08.810 --> 01:07:13.220
be like, I don't
like you response.

01:07:13.220 --> 01:07:14.820
The sympathetic
nervous system wanting

01:07:14.820 --> 01:07:16.250
to either fight or flight.

01:07:19.820 --> 01:07:22.650
And then in the
realm of primates,

01:07:22.650 --> 01:07:24.940
we also have our cortex.

01:07:24.940 --> 01:07:28.340
And what the cortex does is
it makes thoughts and memories

01:07:28.340 --> 01:07:29.450
really important.

01:07:29.450 --> 01:07:32.570
So now, instead of just
having-- losing a lot of blood,

01:07:32.570 --> 01:07:35.620
we're changing how
our body functions.

01:07:35.620 --> 01:07:38.116
And now, not even
having to sense-- we

01:07:38.116 --> 01:07:39.240
don't need to have a sense.

01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:41.090
We can just think
about a thought.

01:07:41.090 --> 01:07:42.910
And that can go ahead
and change the way

01:07:42.910 --> 01:07:45.190
that every organ in
our body functions,

01:07:45.190 --> 01:07:47.140
which is pretty amazing.

01:07:47.140 --> 01:07:49.540
So when you're thinking
about a test, for instance,

01:07:49.540 --> 01:07:51.810
you're going to
activate your cortex.

01:07:51.810 --> 01:07:54.146
And this will activate your
limbic system, and then

01:07:54.146 --> 01:07:54.895
your hypothalamus.

01:07:54.895 --> 01:07:59.430
So that's known, actually, as
the triune system of the brain.

01:07:59.430 --> 01:08:02.520
You have the cortex
in primates, mostly.

01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:06.280
Then you have the limbic
system, mostly mammalian.

01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:08.910
And then you have
the hypothalamus.

01:08:08.910 --> 01:08:12.164
So it's going to go to each one
of these layers of the brain.

01:08:12.164 --> 01:08:13.580
And just thinking
about a test can

01:08:13.580 --> 01:08:15.050
cause a sympathetic
response, where

01:08:15.050 --> 01:08:17.939
you start sweating, getting
nervous, stressed out.

01:08:17.939 --> 01:08:21.810
And it's pretty amazing that
if you lost a lot of blood

01:08:21.810 --> 01:08:24.719
in a reptile, we can stimulate
the same response just

01:08:24.719 --> 01:08:26.260
thinking about
something, or thinking

01:08:26.260 --> 01:08:28.970
about someone on the other
side of the world dying.

01:08:28.970 --> 01:08:32.189
It's just amazing
what primates can do.

01:08:32.189 --> 01:08:34.590
And an interesting
example of this-- and I

01:08:34.590 --> 01:08:36.910
think we're having a lecture
on depression, so I don't

01:08:36.910 --> 01:08:38.770
want to give it all away yet.

01:08:38.770 --> 01:08:41.380
But if you think
about it, the symptoms

01:08:41.380 --> 01:08:45.109
of depression, loss of
pleasure, pain pathways on,

01:08:45.109 --> 01:08:47.214
don't want to have
sex, aren't in the mood

01:08:47.214 --> 01:08:51.550
to eat, you're exhausted all the
time, a lot of these symptoms

01:08:51.550 --> 01:08:53.290
are the same symptoms
you would see

01:08:53.290 --> 01:08:56.910
if your sympathetic nervous
system was overly activated.

01:08:56.910 --> 01:08:59.560
And we can see how the
cortex having bad thoughts

01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:02.126
can go and activate that
system in the same way, links

01:09:02.126 --> 01:09:02.709
to depression.

01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:08.170
And the last thing
I wanted to talk

01:09:08.170 --> 01:09:10.520
about in terms of the
autonomic nervous system

01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:12.460
was the plasticity of it.

01:09:12.460 --> 01:09:15.862
So we just learned the
plasticity in neurons,

01:09:15.862 --> 01:09:17.170
in the synapses.

01:09:17.170 --> 01:09:20.090
So that's when it
can change over time.

01:09:20.090 --> 01:09:22.770
And the autonomic nervous system
can actually change over time,

01:09:22.770 --> 01:09:26.109
in terms of how receptive,
or when it turns on and off.

01:09:26.109 --> 01:09:28.260
And a molecular
example of this is

01:09:28.260 --> 01:09:29.970
if you're a very
stressful person,

01:09:29.970 --> 01:09:31.990
and you're stressing
all the time.

01:09:31.990 --> 01:09:34.280
Well, then you need a
lot of norepinephrine.

01:09:34.280 --> 01:09:36.279
What do you do if you're
stressing all the time?

01:09:36.279 --> 01:09:39.290
You increase the
synthesis of the enzyme

01:09:39.290 --> 01:09:42.569
called tyrosine
hydroxylase, I believe.

01:09:42.569 --> 01:09:43.710
Yeah, it's up there.

01:09:43.710 --> 01:09:45.584
And basically, this is
the rate limiting step

01:09:45.584 --> 01:09:46.660
in making norepinephrine.

01:09:46.660 --> 01:09:48.500
So if you increase
more of the enzyme,

01:09:48.500 --> 01:09:50.810
you increase more of
the norepinephrine,

01:09:50.810 --> 01:09:53.960
you can sustain the
stress response.

01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:56.500
Another example,
cellular example,

01:09:56.500 --> 01:10:00.370
is that we have projections from
the sympathetic nervous system

01:10:00.370 --> 01:10:03.150
to the skin, eyes,
nose, everything

01:10:03.150 --> 01:10:04.960
that's going on out there.

01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:07.760
And let's say we
see something scary.

01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:11.660
We can make those receptors more
sensitive to that scary thing.

01:10:11.660 --> 01:10:14.860
So we can say, hey, it
actually smells that enemy.

01:10:14.860 --> 01:10:16.520
We can make it seem scarier.

01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:19.380
The sympathetic nervous
system can turn on faster,

01:10:19.380 --> 01:10:21.130
so sensitization.

01:10:21.130 --> 01:10:23.500
There's also the opposite
end of the spectrum,

01:10:23.500 --> 01:10:28.300
where you habituate to things
that are going on outside.

01:10:28.300 --> 01:10:31.650
So scary stimuli--
if you see a spider

01:10:31.650 --> 01:10:33.140
in your room the
first time, you're

01:10:33.140 --> 01:10:35.300
probably going to freak
out when you're younger.

01:10:35.300 --> 01:10:37.800
Lots of sympathetic activity,
running away, fight or flight.

01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:41.442
You decide to fly, because
I don't like spiders.

01:10:41.442 --> 01:10:43.900
But basically, after a while,
second time you see a spider,

01:10:43.900 --> 01:10:45.210
you're just like, oh,
this is still scary.

01:10:45.210 --> 01:10:46.310
Maybe I'll run away.

01:10:46.310 --> 01:10:48.675
The third time,
maybe you decide,

01:10:48.675 --> 01:10:51.050
whatever, I'm just going to
leave it there at this point.

01:10:51.050 --> 01:10:52.450
And you're habituated to it.

01:10:52.450 --> 01:10:56.840
So you've made the thresholds
of your sensory receptors,

01:10:56.840 --> 01:10:57.890
they don't care as much.

01:10:57.890 --> 01:11:00.400
They don't respond as much.

01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:03.950
And a last example, when we're
talking about cognitive thought

01:11:03.950 --> 01:11:05.550
and the cortex and
what that can do

01:11:05.550 --> 01:11:09.050
to change our autonomic
nervous system,

01:11:09.050 --> 01:11:12.290
is an example of biofeedback
and blood pressure.

01:11:12.290 --> 01:11:15.980
So basically, if you
have high blood pressure,

01:11:15.980 --> 01:11:18.000
you can go into the
doctor's office.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:19.940
And you have two options.

01:11:19.940 --> 01:11:22.976
You can take medicine, or
you could try biofeedback.

01:11:22.976 --> 01:11:24.350
And what they do
is they tell you

01:11:24.350 --> 01:11:25.850
to think of a pleasant thought.

01:11:25.850 --> 01:11:28.306
So think of your
favorite vacation,

01:11:28.306 --> 01:11:29.680
or think of your
favorite person,

01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:31.689
or just think of the
beach in general.

01:11:31.689 --> 01:11:34.230
And what you'll see is that your
blood pressure will actually

01:11:34.230 --> 01:11:36.010
decrease with a certain thought.

01:11:36.010 --> 01:11:37.760
And then the doctor
will tell you to think

01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:39.040
about that thought again.

01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:41.050
Your blood pressure
will decrease.

01:11:41.050 --> 01:11:43.370
And thinking more and
more about that thought,

01:11:43.370 --> 01:11:45.580
helping your blood
pressure decrease,

01:11:45.580 --> 01:11:49.360
what you do is you potentiate,
remember, you make stronger

01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:53.170
the connection where a
cortical thought can go ahead

01:11:53.170 --> 01:11:56.590
and activate more
parasympathetic tone,

01:11:56.590 --> 01:11:57.950
have less sympathetic tone.

01:11:57.950 --> 01:11:59.700
So we're potentiating
that pathway

01:11:59.700 --> 01:12:03.876
by which a thought can cause
our blood pressure to decrease,

01:12:03.876 --> 01:12:04.750
which is pretty cool.

01:12:08.210 --> 01:12:11.040
So the take home points,
if you want to just know

01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:13.637
what to remember from this.

01:12:13.637 --> 01:12:15.470
Know the broad difference
between autonomic,

01:12:15.470 --> 01:12:18.030
automatic, and the voluntary
nervous system, what we

01:12:18.030 --> 01:12:20.660
talked about at the beginning.

01:12:20.660 --> 01:12:23.680
Understand the neurotransmitters
involved in each,

01:12:23.680 --> 01:12:26.020
and why you need two
types of receptors,

01:12:26.020 --> 01:12:28.442
the inhibitory and excitatory.

01:12:28.442 --> 01:12:31.400
Know one or two examples of
what the parasympathetic--

01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:33.250
that's what PNS,
by the way, means--

01:12:33.250 --> 01:12:35.560
and sympathetic nervous
system do to an organ.

01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:39.820
So remember the heart,
the digestive tract,

01:12:39.820 --> 01:12:42.380
the male reproductive system.

01:12:42.380 --> 01:12:45.640
And then know a broad overview
of how the brain regulates

01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:50.270
the autonomic nervous system,
so hypothalamus, cortex,

01:12:50.270 --> 01:12:53.230
and we have the limbic system.

01:12:53.230 --> 01:12:56.400
On Monday, we're going
over endocrinology.

01:12:56.400 --> 01:12:58.300
So have a good--

01:12:58.300 --> 01:13:01.550
