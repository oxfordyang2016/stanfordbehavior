00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.930
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:08.200
Stanford University.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.370
--out by now, I am
not Dr. Sapolsky.

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.280
You probably got some cues from
the beard and other things.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.220
My name is Nathan.

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:16.520
I'm a graduate student.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.720
I'm a fourth year PhD student
in the neuroscience program.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.610
And I'm going to be giving you
the introductory lecture today

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:27.010
on, basically how
the brain works.

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:29.370
And just to get a sense of
who is here before I get

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:32.000
started, how many
of you are either

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.940
a biology major or HumBio majors
and decided to come today?

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.040
That's a lot of people.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.700
OK.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.910
How many in other hard
sciences or engineering?

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:42.730
A few.

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:43.570
OK.

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.440
How many in the social sciences?

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:47.940
A few.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.290
And humanities?

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:51.330
All right, humanities.

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.230
Anybody else in anything other?

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:54.730
OK.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.830
We've got a few others as well.

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:57.810
OK, great.

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.660
So for some of you, this
is going to be a review.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.845
And hopefully, you'll
still learn something new.

00:01:02.845 --> 00:01:04.970
For some of you, this is
going to be the first time

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.550
that you're hearing these terms.

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:08.740
And hopefully,
this will give you

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.250
just a very general
background so

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.350
that when you hear Dr.
Sapolsky give lectures

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.490
on neuroscience later, you have
a better understanding of what

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.420
he's talking about.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.590
So we started out this
whole course talking

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.780
about the everlasting
question of,

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.390
why did the chicken
cross the road?

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.130
Yes, that's supposed
to be a chicken.

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.890
My major is not art.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.540
But the chicken is
crossing the road.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.120
And we started the
course basically

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.380
saying that this whole course
is going to teach us why

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:42.890
the chicken crossed the road.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.370
And specifically, the
first half of this course

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.630
is talking about the ways
that different sciences

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.470
have approached this question.

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.890
So we started out
with evolution,

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.640
which would ask, how did this
behavior of crossing the road

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.680
evolve over many, many,
many millions of years?

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:00.860
Why was it adaptive?

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.770
Why did chickens who crossed
the road produce more offspring?

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:04.370
All of that.

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.010
It was studied by
old men going around

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.039
in boats to the
Galapagos to see how

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.490
chickens on different
islands crossed the road

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.150
and then figured out
how that happened

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.130
over millions of years.

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.990
The next week, we went
into molecular genetics.

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.830
And there we talked
about the actual genes

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.100
that control this evolution
and how it happened.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.900
And there we were talking
about people thinking

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.190
about how genes change
in the genome over time,

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.230
how they hop around, if we're
thinking about women in corn

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.440
fields looking at this, and
how those individual genes led

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.240
to evolution.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.350
Then the next week, we went
into behavior genetics.

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.070
And this, specifically
was asking

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.100
about what individual
genes are accounting

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.270
for the variation in the ways
the chicken crossed the road.

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.180
So some chickens cross
the road really fast.

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.930
Some of them do it slowly.

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.630
Some of them don't do it at all.

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.670
How does the
variation in the way

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.980
that the genomes are structured
for these different chickens

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.210
account for that?

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.260
So that was behavior genetics.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.940
And then on Monday, you
heard about ethology,

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.710
which really talked
about studying

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:13.170
this behavior in nature.

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.680
And we talked about the
fixed action pattern.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.370
And we talked about
all the old man

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.280
in field booths going out into
nature to observe that fixed

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.920
action pattern and talked about
the stimulus the chicken would

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.230
receive, why it would
cross the road after that,

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.540
how it does it, again,
looking at that out in nature.

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.830
And that was ethology.

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.360
So today, we're going to talk
about yet another bucket, yet

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.820
another way to think about
this, which is neuroscience.

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:43.110
And neuroscience is going
to focus, specifically

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:48.080
on this black box that
we talked about on Monday

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.080
where you get the input coming
in of some stimulus that makes

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.440
the chicken cross the road.

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.680
And neuroscience is about
that black box in the middle

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.704
and why it is that the
chicken is doing this.

00:03:59.704 --> 00:04:01.370
What was going on in
the chicken's brain

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.860
a few milliseconds before
it crossed the road?

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.400
Why is it that the
specific cells in the brain

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.420
are doing this?

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.020
And how are they doing it?

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.730
So that's the overall
background of why we're

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:14.550
thinking about neuroscience.

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:17.750
And the goal for today
is really to give you

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.540
an overview of the brain
and the nervous system,

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.210
get to know some
different parts of it

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.520
not so that you memorize a list
of different parts of the brain

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.305
but so that you get
a general overview

00:04:28.305 --> 00:04:29.680
that different
parts of the brain

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.430
are specialized for
different behaviors.

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.700
And also, we're going
to zoom in a little bit

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.290
on the actual cells in the
brain, how they communicate.

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.080
Again, not so that you can
sit there memorizing lists

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.910
of different things
but that so when

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.520
it comes up in
future lectures, you

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.370
will have a better understanding
of what we're talking about.

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:53.291
And just as a caveat before we
start, I, as a neuroscientist,

00:04:53.291 --> 00:04:55.540
think this is the coolest
discipline out there, better

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:56.760
than all the others.

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.930
And you'll see I put in a
quote from Thomas Edison that

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:01.490
says, "The chief
function of the body

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.220
is to carry the
brain around," which

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.900
is a very brain-centric way
of thinking about the world.

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.650
And there are a lot of people
who look at neuroscience

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:11.300
and think of it that way.

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.770
Yes, neuroscience
has its limitations.

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.730
Want to put that out
there from the beginning.

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:16.940
It can be very brain-centric.

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.370
It can be thinking about how
different parts of the brain

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:23.000
control different behaviors
without considering the bigger

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.980
evolutionary aspects or
any of the other aspects.

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:27.992
So it does have its limitations.

00:05:27.992 --> 00:05:29.200
But I think it's really cool.

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.860
So that's why I'm going to
tell you about it today.

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.550
So let's start out.

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:36.930
You have a brain.

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:38.750
Actually, this is my brain.

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:41.700
I volunteered for a psych
study back in college

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:44.380
and got to look at some
pictures in a scanner.

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:47.410
And they gave me this printout
of my brain afterwards.

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:50.750
And the brain, I think,
is an absolutely amazing,

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:51.990
amazing thing.

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:55.880
And one thing that people
love about the brain

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.550
is that it starts working
and keeps working.

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:00.689
But just as a reminder
from this quote,

00:06:00.689 --> 00:06:03.230
"It never stops working until
you stand up in front of public

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:04.220
to speak."

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:06.410
So during this
lecture, there may

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:07.731
be things that are confusing.

00:06:07.731 --> 00:06:10.230
If you don't understand them
because I'm not explaining them

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:12.660
in a way that makes them
understandable to you,

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:14.640
I've put my email
address up there.

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.160
It's also in the handout.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.220
And it was at the beginning
of the presentation.

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:20.370
So definitely email me if
you have any questions.

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:22.760
Or come to see me after class.

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:26.840
And I'll be giving this
first 45 minutes or so

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:29.810
introduction to the brain
and the nervous system.

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:32.340
Then, Anthony's going to come
up afterwards and tell you

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:33.900
a little bit more
about how neurons

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:36.320
communicate with each other.

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:40.290
So let's think about the
brain and the nervous system.

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:42.980
And to give you a
really broad overview,

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:47.310
the nervous system is divided
into two really broad classes,

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:51.320
the central nervous system and
the peripheral nervous system.

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:53.570
And we'll start with the
central nervous system, which

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:55.069
is what most people
think about when

00:06:55.069 --> 00:06:56.760
they think about
neuroscience, which

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:58.622
is the brain and spinal cord.

00:06:58.622 --> 00:07:00.830
So you have this brain
sitting up there in your head.

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:02.288
You have the spinal
cord going down

00:07:02.288 --> 00:07:04.620
communicating to
and from the brain.

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:07.660
And this is the
central nervous system.

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:09.740
And I'm going to go through
some different parts

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:11.557
of the central
nervous system just

00:07:11.557 --> 00:07:13.640
to give you an idea that
there are different parts

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:15.480
and that they do
different things.

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:18.620
Again, don't worry
about memorizing them.

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:20.830
This is really just to get
you familiar with what's

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:23.340
going on up there.

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:25.970
So if we look at the
brain more carefully

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:27.800
and look at different
parts of the brain,

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.840
we've got these different parts
that people-- neuroscientists

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:33.790
specifically-- have
divided up for us.

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:36.810
And if we start at the bottom
down there with the brain stem,

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:38.830
the brain stem sits at
the bottom of the brain

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:41.030
at the top of the spinal cord.

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:43.500
And it's what ends up
relaying the information

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:46.630
to and from the spinal cord
and to and from the brain.

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:48.130
So you have your
brain up here doing

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:51.130
all the processing, spinal
cord down there sending out

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:53.730
all the signals to make
you move or to send up

00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:55.290
sensory information.

00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:56.690
The brain stem
sits in the middle

00:07:56.690 --> 00:07:59.950
and helps regulate
what goes through.

00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:02.870
Then, you have the cerebellum
sitting at the very back

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:04.461
of the brain up there.

00:08:04.461 --> 00:08:06.710
And the cerebellum is a
really cool part of the brain.

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:08.060
It's really, really wrinkled.

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:10.690
It has lots of different
cells packed into it.

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:13.960
And what it does is it helps
control your motor movement

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:17.160
and specifically helps when you
have to learn something new.

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:20.840
So when you have to learn how
to play piano for the first time

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:24.010
or when you have to play
basketball for the first time,

00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:25.650
you're going to make mistakes.

00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:27.900
And what the cerebellum
does is it helps

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:29.540
correct for those mistakes.

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:32.770
So when you are shooting
a hoop for the first time

00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:34.937
and it goes off to the left,
then you have to learn,

00:08:34.937 --> 00:08:37.103
OK, I need to move it over
to the right a little bit

00:08:37.103 --> 00:08:37.720
next time.

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:40.000
The cerebellum is
what does that.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.929
And when I teach this to middle
schoolers or high schoolers,

00:08:42.929 --> 00:08:44.750
one fun thing I
do with them is I

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:47.220
bring along these
specialized classes,

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:49.120
which have prisms on them.

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:50.950
So when you wear them,
it skews your view

00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:53.810
of the world a few
degrees to one side.

00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:56.480
So if I'm looking,
say, at this marker

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:59.020
here, when I put on
the prisms, it's going

00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:01.170
to look like it's over here.

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:02.230
So I do this to the kids.

00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:03.730
And the kids look
out at the marker,

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:05.660
and I tell them to
quickly reach for it.

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:07.140
They see it over here.

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:09.090
So they start out
reaching this way thinking

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:10.720
that the marker is over there.

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.970
But what happens over
time is that they

00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:16.790
do this over a few minutes, and
eventually they correct for it.

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:19.160
So even though their
vision is out here,

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:22.630
they've corrected for it by
moving their arm over here

00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:23.960
to where the marker is.

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:27.130
And that's learning that
happens in the cerebellum.

00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:30.130
Then, the really cool thing
is they take off the glasses.

00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:32.040
And because the
cerebellum has taught them

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:33.873
that they need to reach
to the left of where

00:09:33.873 --> 00:09:36.910
the visual field is, they
look out at this marker.

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:39.060
They start reaching over
here to try to get it.

00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:41.800
So the cerebellum
corrects for that.

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:44.220
And again, after a
few minutes, they

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:45.550
do that a little bit longer.

00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:47.340
And they eventually
reach for the marker.

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:48.798
So that's learning
that's happening

00:09:48.798 --> 00:09:52.460
in the cerebellum, really
cool part of the brain.

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:54.710
Then above the brain
stem and the cerebellum,

00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:56.860
you have this
wrinkled outer layer

00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:59.020
of the brain called the cortex.

00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:00.850
And the cortex we
can broadly think

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:03.120
of in four different lobes.

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:07.007
And again, broad theme for
this lecture, different lobes,

00:10:07.007 --> 00:10:08.840
different parts of the
brain are specialized

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:10.590
for different functions.

00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:13.070
So you have the frontal lobe
up, as you would expect,

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:14.840
at the front of the brain.

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:17.590
And the frontal lobe,
among many other things,

00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:21.030
plans your actions and
controls your movement.

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:22.440
So this is the
part of your brain

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:24.570
that's going to be sending
a lot of connections

00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:27.870
down through the spinal cord
to make you move your arms,

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:30.700
move your legs, move the
other parts of your body.

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:34.260
And that's all happening
because of the neurons

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:37.940
that are up there in the spinal
cord-- in the frontal lobe.

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:40.850
And again, broad theme,
different parts of the brain

00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:43.000
are specialized for
different functions.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.520
Different parts of the
frontal lobe, different parts

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:48.100
of that part of the cortex
that control movement

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:50.210
control different
parts of your body.

00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:52.460
So you've got a part of
that frontal cortex that

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:54.620
controls your foot
and your left foot

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:57.290
and your right foot and your
left hand and your right hand.

00:10:57.290 --> 00:11:01.099
And they're all in specific
places in the cortex.

00:11:01.099 --> 00:11:03.140
And they line up the way
you would expect them to

00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:04.100
in the body.

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:07.169
So if your foot
cortex is down here,

00:11:07.169 --> 00:11:08.710
then your leg and
your knee are going

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:10.990
to be up here and then
your trunk and then

00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:14.430
your arms and then the parts
of the cortex that control

00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:16.160
facial movements up at the top.

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:19.450
So it's organized
according to function.

00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:22.880
So that's one thing that
happens in the frontal lobe.

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:25.390
Then, you have behind
it the parietal lobe.

00:11:25.390 --> 00:11:28.250
And right next to the part
that controls your movement

00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:31.510
in the frontal lobe is the
part of the parietal lobe

00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:34.400
that senses the sensory
touch information

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:36.250
from the outside world.

00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:38.560
And again, form
follows function.

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:40.462
So different parts
of the parietal lobe

00:11:40.462 --> 00:11:41.920
are specialized
for different parts

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:44.840
of the body, different parts
of your touch information.

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:47.180
And not only are there
different parts of it

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:51.300
but the sizes of the cortex
that receive that information

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:53.110
are also different sizes.

00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:55.600
So you've got your finger tips
that are really sensitive,

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:59.200
have lots of nerve endings,
have lots of sensory information

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:00.390
coming from them.

00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:03.360
Your fingertips have a big
part of cortex represented

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:04.820
in the parietal lobe.

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:07.010
So again, different parts,
different functions,

00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:09.180
different sizes.

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:12.480
Below the parietal lobe,
you have the temporal lobe,

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:14.480
which is sitting here
next to your temples

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:15.960
as you might expect.

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:18.400
And the temporal lobe,
among other things,

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:20.930
receives the
auditory information.

00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:24.400
Your hearing information comes
into that part of the cortex.

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:27.910
And also, as you'll hear
later, deep inside that lobe

00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:31.390
are the parts of the brain
that help for memory formation.

00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:34.590
So the temporal lobe
receives auditory information

00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:39.065
and also has a really important
part for memory formation.

00:12:39.065 --> 00:12:40.690
Then finally, at the
back of the brain,

00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:42.624
you have the occipital lobe.

00:12:42.624 --> 00:12:44.290
And all the way at
the back of the brain

00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:46.460
here, this occipital
lobe is where you're

00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:48.700
receiving visual information.

00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:51.210
So visual information
comes into your eyes,

00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:53.050
travels all the way to
the back of the brain

00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:54.550
to the occipital lobe.

00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:56.470
And that's where
it gets processed.

00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:59.330
So different parts of the brain
are doing different things.

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:03.080
And this is just a really broad
way of thinking about that.

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:05.227
So I'm next going to go
over some specific parts

00:13:05.227 --> 00:13:07.060
of the brain that you're
going to hear a lot

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:09.250
about in the coming lectures.

00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:11.160
For now, it's just
an introduction.

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:13.280
But hopefully, when you
hear them again later,

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:16.510
you'll be able to say,
ah, I remember that.

00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:18.140
So the limbic
system, you're going

00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:20.640
to hear about again
and again and again.

00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:24.090
It's this series of structures
that are underneath the cortex

00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:26.420
but sort of above
the brain stem.

00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:29.600
And in general, the limbic
system controls a lot of things

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:32.810
that we associate with
emotion, with learning,

00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:35.380
memory, really important
things that an animal has

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:36.777
to do to behave.

00:13:36.777 --> 00:13:38.360
And two structures
we're going to hear

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:41.810
a lot about time and time
again are the hippocampus

00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:43.520
and the amygdala.

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:46.390
So the hippocampus
up there in blue

00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:50.860
is-- well, the hippocampus
word itself means seahorse.

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:52.614
And supposedly,
when neuroanatomists

00:13:52.614 --> 00:13:54.030
were looking at
this, they thought

00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:55.790
it looked like a seahorse.

00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:58.090
I don't see it, but
let me know if you do.

00:13:58.090 --> 00:14:01.720
And this part of the brain is
really important for memory

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:03.770
and forming new memories.

00:14:03.770 --> 00:14:07.060
And the way that scientists
first found this out in humans

00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:10.260
anyway was by a
bit of an accident.

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:13.800
The hippocampus, they
found out, is this place

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:15.300
where new memories are made.

00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:17.790
But they didn't do it by any
sort of experimental approach

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:20.410
that you would suspect them to.

00:14:20.410 --> 00:14:22.850
What happened is there
was this patient,

00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:26.230
one of the most famous patients
in all of neuroscience,

00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:27.835
named HM.

00:14:27.835 --> 00:14:30.760
For privacy reasons, his
name up until he died

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:32.133
was known just as HM.

00:14:32.133 --> 00:14:36.340
And this patient had really
terrible seizures, really bad

00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:38.510
epilepsy that could
not be controlled

00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:40.910
and was debilitated
by these seizures.

00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:43.190
So when he was a
young man, they tried

00:14:43.190 --> 00:14:44.920
all sorts of
different techniques

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:46.672
to try to control
these seizures.

00:14:46.672 --> 00:14:48.130
And in the end,
what they had to do

00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:50.296
was actually figure out
where these seizures started

00:14:50.296 --> 00:14:54.030
in the brain and surgically
remove that part.

00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:57.240
And it turned out that
part in this patient

00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:59.070
included the hippocampus.

00:14:59.070 --> 00:15:02.260
So they took out the hippocampus
on both sides of the brain.

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:05.060
And after the
surgery, Patient HM

00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:06.581
didn't have seizures anymore.

00:15:06.581 --> 00:15:07.080
Great.

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:08.390
Wonderful.

00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:11.810
But what they found out is
that this patient afterwards

00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:14.080
couldn't form any new memories.

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:16.360
When he had nurses
come in to visit him

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:20.030
who visited him every
day after the surgery,

00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:22.320
every time he met them it
was like he was meeting them

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:23.600
for the first time.

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:25.760
He couldn't store that memory.

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:27.870
But the really
interesting thing was

00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:30.340
when they asked him about
events from his childhood,

00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:31.880
he could still remember those.

00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:34.270
He could remember who the
president of the United States

00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:35.700
was in his childhood.

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:38.700
So the memories were stored
somewhere else in the brain.

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:41.020
But the ability to
make the new memories

00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:43.290
was dependent on
the hippocampus.

00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:45.602
So that's how they
discovered by accident

00:15:45.602 --> 00:15:47.810
that the hippocampus is the
part of the brain forming

00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:49.447
new memories.

00:15:49.447 --> 00:15:51.030
Another part of the
brain you're going

00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:54.890
to hear about a lot, a lot,
a lot is make the amygdala.

00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:59.150
And the amygdala are those two
yellow almond-shaped things

00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:02.094
sitting up in the front
of the hippocampus.

00:16:02.094 --> 00:16:03.510
And as you've
already heard, these

00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:05.093
are parts of the
brain that are really

00:16:05.093 --> 00:16:07.250
involved in fear and anxiety.

00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:09.920
So if you remember the
example that Dr. Sapolsky gave

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:12.830
on Monday when he was
talking about scared

00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:16.200
sweat versus exercise sweat
and how we can actually

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:21.160
tell whether we're smelling
scared sweat or exercise sweat,

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:23.020
one way that they
see that difference

00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:25.910
is when they look at the brains
of people who are smelling

00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:29.630
sweat from a scared person,
the amygdala lights up.

00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:31.340
But when you're
smelling sweat that

00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:33.670
was given off by somebody
who was exercising,

00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:35.520
it doesn't light up as much.

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:38.500
So the amygdala's really
important for sensing fear.

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:42.790
And it's important for
forming anxiety as well.

00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:45.320
So when you look at an angry
face or a fearful face,

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:46.670
the amygdala will light up.

00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:49.850
But when you look at a
happy face, it won't.

00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:50.880
So that's the amygdala.

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:53.150
You'll hear a lot
more about it later,

00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:58.050
really important part of the
brain for fear and anxiety.

00:16:58.050 --> 00:17:00.560
Other parts of the brain you're
sure to hear tons and tons

00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:04.030
and tons about later on are
the hypothalamus and pituitary

00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:05.349
gland.

00:17:05.349 --> 00:17:09.109
And these are-- you can think
of them as hormone central.

00:17:09.109 --> 00:17:11.040
These are the parts
of the brain that

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:12.440
control how hormones
are released

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:15.714
to the rest of the body, control
a lot of different behaviors.

00:17:15.714 --> 00:17:18.089
So the hypothalamus sits in
the center of the brain right

00:17:18.089 --> 00:17:19.480
at the very bottom.

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:21.470
And the pituitary
is underneath it

00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:23.060
and secretes a lot
of those hormones

00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:24.970
out into the bloodstream.

00:17:24.970 --> 00:17:28.400
And it's an old joke
but one that gets

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:30.139
repeated over and over again.

00:17:30.139 --> 00:17:32.180
You can think of the
different types of behaviors

00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:35.180
that the hypothalamus
controls as four Fs.

00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:36.650
You've got fight.

00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:38.250
You've got flight.

00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:41.860
You've got feeding behavior
and reproductive behavior.

00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:45.220
So you've got those four Fs of
what the hypothalamus controls.

00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:45.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:46.220
Yes.

00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:46.940
Now, you get it.

00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:48.380
Yes.

00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:51.612
So you're going to hear tons
and tons more about this.

00:17:51.612 --> 00:17:54.070
For now, just know that they
sit at the bottom of the brain

00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:57.254
and help control a lot
of these behaviors.

00:17:57.254 --> 00:17:59.170
So what else do we have
in the nervous system?

00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:01.410
We've got all these
different parts of the brain.

00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:03.540
But we've also got
the spinal cord

00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:05.360
coming down from the brain.

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:06.930
And just like in
the brain itself,

00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:08.810
the spinal cord is specialized.

00:18:08.810 --> 00:18:12.810
You have parts of the spinal
cord that send out information.

00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:14.660
And you've got parts
of the spinal cord that

00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:16.130
receive the information.

00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:17.290
So you've got motor nerves.

00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:19.610
And you've got sensory
nerves in different parts

00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:20.606
of the spinal cord.

00:18:20.606 --> 00:18:22.980
You've got different parts of
the spinal cord, of course,

00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:25.870
for your arms and your
legs, basically what

00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:28.270
you need to know for now
about the spinal cord.

00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:30.920
You're also going to be hearing
a lot more in future lectures

00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:33.190
about the peripheral
nervous system.

00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:34.780
And the peripheral
nervous system

00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:38.300
has all of the motor nerves
and sensory nerves that

00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:40.200
are outside of the spinal cord.

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:43.750
So a lot of the things that
sense touch information or heat

00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:45.650
or anything else
out in the periphery

00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:47.970
are part of the
peripheral nervous system.

00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:50.500
And then, you've
also got a whole part

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:52.940
of the peripheral nervous
system that happens

00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:54.380
pretty much automatically.

00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:55.940
You don't have to
think about it.

00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:58.900
So you've got nerves that are
controlling your heartbeat,

00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:01.419
your digestion, your breathing.

00:19:01.419 --> 00:19:02.960
And normally, you
don't have to think

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:04.231
about keeping those going.

00:19:04.231 --> 00:19:05.980
So those are another
part that you'll hear

00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:09.280
a lot more from Dana later on.

00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:11.790
So that's really
a broad overview

00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:14.170
of the different parts
of the nervous system

00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:15.960
and what they do.

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:18.510
So now, we're going to think
a little bit more closely

00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:21.730
about what's actually
inside a brain, what

00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:24.240
the individual cells
are, what they're doing,

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:27.060
how they make you behave.

00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:29.327
And again, this is not a
list for you to remember.

00:19:29.327 --> 00:19:31.910
It's just to let you know that
there are different cell types,

00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:34.260
and they have
different functions.

00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:38.950
And I'm going to tell you first
about something that came up

00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:41.110
while I was looking online
and trying to figure out

00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:43.050
what to say for this lecture.

00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:46.340
And I realize that it's
illegal in seven states

00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:48.920
to give an introductory
neuroscience lecture

00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:51.880
and not mention the name
Santiago Ramon y Cajal.

00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:56.650
So Santiago Ramon y Cajal,
why is he this god figure

00:19:56.650 --> 00:19:57.880
in neuroscience?

00:19:57.880 --> 00:19:59.600
What did he do?

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:01.780
So when Santiago
Roman y Cajal was

00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:05.680
doing most of his scientific
work at the end of the 1800s,

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:09.890
mostly in the 1890s,
the general theory

00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:11.990
about the way the
brain worked was

00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:14.850
that it wasn't individual
cells that were

00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:15.990
performing their functions.

00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:18.540
Instead, the brain was
thought of as this web,

00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:22.280
this interconnected
web of mush, basically,

00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:24.890
that did all of its
computational work

00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:26.130
to make you behave.

00:20:26.130 --> 00:20:29.210
People knew that the brain
was where behavior started

00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:30.950
and where it was controlled.

00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:33.060
But they didn't really
know what it was

00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:34.710
inside the brain that did that.

00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:38.700
So the prevailing theory
was that you had this web.

00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:40.800
And rather than just
take that at face value,

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:44.000
Ramon y Cajal decided to
experimentally figure out

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.410
if that was the case.

00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:47.800
So he found this really
cool technique invented

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:49.770
by a different guy named Golgi.

00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:51.970
And this technique
allowed him to take

00:20:51.970 --> 00:20:55.470
small slices of the
brain and turn about 1%

00:20:55.470 --> 00:20:57.700
of the cells in
that slice black.

00:20:57.700 --> 00:20:59.090
We still don't
know how it works.

00:20:59.090 --> 00:21:00.880
But he was able to do it.

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:04.230
And then, he drew these really,
really detailed pictures

00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:06.330
of what that looked
like in the microscope.

00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:09.552
And these images are
just absolutely gorgeous.

00:21:09.552 --> 00:21:11.260
There's a whole class
of people that when

00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:14.730
they see these images, tears
of joy stream down their face.

00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:17.210
They fall to their
knees weeping, praising

00:21:17.210 --> 00:21:18.950
the gods of neuroscience.

00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:22.110
These are the people who become
neuroscience graduate students.

00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:25.620
So these cells and these
pictures that he drew

00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:27.220
showed us that
there actually are

00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:30.810
individual cells in the brain
that are doing this work.

00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:33.440
It's not a complete mess.

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:35.240
It's not a complete web.

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:37.730
It's actually individual cells.

00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:41.500
And so he drew out these
beautiful pictures of neurons

00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:44.610
and also all of the other
cells that are in the brain.

00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:46.360
And I have a good
friend who studies

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:49.450
all of these other cells in the
brain that are not the neurons,

00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:52.796
not the ones that are actually
doing the computational work.

00:21:52.796 --> 00:21:55.170
And I promised her I'd never
give an introductory lecture

00:21:55.170 --> 00:21:56.710
without mentioning these.

00:21:56.710 --> 00:21:59.420
So first, I'll start
out with those cells.

00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:03.330
So 90% of the cells in
your brain and spinal cord

00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:05.160
are not actually neurons.

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:07.100
They're called glia.

00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:08.976
And glia basically,
by definition

00:22:08.976 --> 00:22:10.600
is anything in the
brain or spinal cord

00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:12.230
that is not a neuron.

00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:15.960
And glia, the word,
means glue because people

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:18.510
saw these cells in there and
thought they were just glue

00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:20.540
sticking the neurons together.

00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:23.510
But it turns out they actually
do a lot more than that.

00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:26.340
You've got cells called
astrocytes, which

00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:28.580
are these star-shaped cells.

00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:30.650
And they, in a
very general sense,

00:22:30.650 --> 00:22:33.100
supply nutrients to
the neurons and help

00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:35.330
regulate how they fire.

00:22:35.330 --> 00:22:38.650
Then, you've also got these
cells called oligodendrocytes,

00:22:38.650 --> 00:22:40.080
or Schwann cells.

00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:42.530
Again, long names you
don't need to memorize.

00:22:42.530 --> 00:22:45.330
But they wrap around
the wires of neurons

00:22:45.330 --> 00:22:48.010
and make their firing go faster.

00:22:48.010 --> 00:22:49.750
Then, you've got
microglia, which

00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:52.190
are yet another glial cell
that are in the brain.

00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:54.660
And they're basically the
brain's immune system.

00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:55.950
They move around the brain.

00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:58.880
They send out little processes
out into parts of the brain

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:01.360
to figure out if the brain is
getting infected by viruses

00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:03.770
or bacteria or if there
are any dead cells that

00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:05.050
need to be cleared up.

00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:07.080
And they do all of that work.

00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:10.890
So 90% of your brain is actually
all of these other cells doing

00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:12.140
this work.

00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:14.130
But what they're
doing this work for

00:23:14.130 --> 00:23:16.760
is so that you can have
your neurons working.

00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:18.580
And the neurons are
what we're going

00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:21.890
to focus on for the next
10, 15 minutes or so.

00:23:21.890 --> 00:23:25.210
And these are the
complicated but wonderful

00:23:25.210 --> 00:23:28.130
computational
units of the brain.

00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:30.550
And in an average
human brain, you've

00:23:30.550 --> 00:23:33.720
got about 100 billion neurons.

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:36.970
And each of those has
about 10,000 connections

00:23:36.970 --> 00:23:38.120
to other neurons.

00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:40.144
And those connections
are called synapses.

00:23:40.144 --> 00:23:41.560
So if you think
about that, you've

00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:44.950
got roughly a
quadrillion synapses

00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:49.390
in your brain, a quadrillion
connections between neurons.

00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:51.870
And just to give you some
perspective, the number

00:23:51.870 --> 00:23:53.760
of stars in the
Milky Way, the number

00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:57.000
of stars that you can see
out there in our own galaxy

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.810
is about 300 billion.

00:23:58.810 --> 00:24:00.730
So you've got a
quadrillion synapses

00:24:00.730 --> 00:24:03.750
just sitting there in your
brain, which is already

00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:06.510
more than 1,000 times more
than the number of stars

00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:08.370
that are out there in
the Milky Way galaxy.

00:24:08.370 --> 00:24:10.280
So you've got all of
these connections packed

00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:13.960
in there in their brain doing
all of this computational work.

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:17.200
So how does it actually work?

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:24.651
So here I'm actually going
to switch over if I can.

00:24:24.651 --> 00:24:25.151
Great.

00:24:28.910 --> 00:24:31.620
So here we're going to talk
about the neuron itself

00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:33.440
and what the different
parts of it are,

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:34.860
what the different
parts of it do,

00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:37.540
and how it works,
how it communicates.

00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:41.080
So this is a very badly
drawn picture of a neuron.

00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:43.370
But it will give you an
idea of what a neuron is

00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:45.030
and how it functions.

00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:46.530
So you've got
different parts of it.

00:24:46.530 --> 00:24:51.630
You've got out here, dendrites.

00:24:51.630 --> 00:24:55.180
And these are what receive
the information on a neuron.

00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:57.820
They get the information
from the cell before it

00:24:57.820 --> 00:25:01.260
and pass it on
down into the cell.

00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:06.460
Down here you've got the soma
or the cell body of the neuron.

00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:09.145
And importantly, you
have the nucleus,

00:25:09.145 --> 00:25:10.770
just like you do in
any other cell that

00:25:10.770 --> 00:25:13.040
has all the DNA in it.

00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:16.050
And then, there's an
important part down here.

00:25:16.050 --> 00:25:18.510
So you're getting all of
this input from the dendrites

00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:22.950
from the cells before giving
you information at the dendrites

00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:24.720
that goes into the cell.

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:26.470
And somehow the
cell has to decide

00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:31.020
whether to pass that information
on to the next cell or not.

00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:34.680
And that happens at this
specialized part of the cell

00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:40.650
called the axon hillock.

00:25:40.650 --> 00:25:42.740
I guess it's like a hill
but not quite as big.

00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:45.050
So you have the
axon hillock there.

00:25:45.050 --> 00:25:47.572
And then down here,
you have the axon,

00:25:47.572 --> 00:25:49.280
which you can think
of as the wire that's

00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:52.600
sending the information
on to the next cell.

00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:57.270
And then down here,
you have the terminal.

00:25:57.270 --> 00:25:59.610
And this is where the cell
will send on information

00:25:59.610 --> 00:26:02.260
on to the next neuron.

00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:04.234
So these are the general
parts of a neuron

00:26:04.234 --> 00:26:05.900
that you'll need to
think about in terms

00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:07.680
of how neurons communicate.

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:09.130
And information
is generally going

00:26:09.130 --> 00:26:12.640
to flow from dendrites
down to the cell body,

00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:14.910
get summed up at
the axon hillock.

00:26:14.910 --> 00:26:17.540
The cell will decide
whether to fire or not

00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:20.460
and send that on
down to the terminal.

00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:23.000
So that's a basic
overview of a neuron

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.310
and how those
different parts work.

00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:27.140
So how does it actually work?

00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:29.500
How does it actually
send that signal?

00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:32.600
And this is just going to give
you a really broad overview

00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:34.507
of how a neuron does this.

00:26:34.507 --> 00:26:36.340
So if you think about
a neuron sitting there

00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:37.970
in the middle of
the brain, there's

00:26:37.970 --> 00:26:40.970
lots of electrical activity,
lots of things going on.

00:26:40.970 --> 00:26:43.300
Somehow a neuron if
it sends a signal

00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:46.340
has to get heard
above all that noise.

00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:50.590
So the way a neuron
solves this problem is it

00:26:50.590 --> 00:26:57.430
is either on or completely
off, completely quiet.

00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:04.590
It's not a system where
you have a continuum,

00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:09.140
where you have-- where
the cell is kind of on,

00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:11.080
a little bit more
on, a little bit more

00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:12.950
on, and then totally on.

00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:15.560
It's not that way.

00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:18.920
Because that wouldn't really get
heard above all of the noise.

00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:23.027
So what you have is a cell
that's either on or off.

00:27:23.027 --> 00:27:24.610
And a neuron really
wants to make sure

00:27:24.610 --> 00:27:28.500
that it stays off until
it's ready to send a signal.

00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:30.960
So that's how the
neuron stays quiet.

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:32.740
And when we talk
about that in biology,

00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:36.120
we talk about the neuron
keeping a resting potential,

00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:39.870
a resting quiet
level of activity.

00:27:39.870 --> 00:27:42.810
So how does a neuron do that?

00:27:42.810 --> 00:27:44.620
So the way that
neurons communicate

00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:48.080
and the way that they
send on electrical signals

00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:51.170
is going to be
through the movement

00:27:51.170 --> 00:27:53.540
of these chemicals called ions.

00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:55.830
For those of you who
are not science people,

00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:57.990
just think of them
as charged chemicals.

00:27:57.990 --> 00:28:00.260
We're just going to
talk about general ions

00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:02.520
for today, which
are charged atoms.

00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:05.260
So they can have a positive
charge or a negative charge.

00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:08.590
And we're going to talk about
mostly positive charges today.

00:28:08.590 --> 00:28:12.180
So the neuron has to keep quiet.

00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:15.030
And the way it does
that is by keeping

00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:21.710
positive charges, positive
ions outside of the neurons.

00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:25.420
So you have all of these
positive ions sitting

00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:27.850
there outside of the neuron.

00:28:27.850 --> 00:28:29.710
And this is how it stays quiet.

00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:31.930
Because the flow of these
ions is going to be what

00:28:31.930 --> 00:28:34.160
communicates the signal.

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:36.070
So how does it do that?

00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:41.330
It keeps these ions out of
the cell by using these pumps.

00:28:41.330 --> 00:28:44.550
So it has pumps
that will pump out

00:28:44.550 --> 00:28:46.520
positive charges from
the inside of the cell

00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:48.370
to the outside of the cell.

00:28:48.370 --> 00:28:50.770
So by using those
pumps, the neuron

00:28:50.770 --> 00:28:52.850
is keeping all of the
positive charges, all

00:28:52.850 --> 00:28:56.050
of the positive ions mostly
on the outside of the cell,

00:28:56.050 --> 00:28:57.900
rather than on the inside.

00:28:57.900 --> 00:29:00.470
So that means that
the net charge

00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:03.320
on the inside of the cell
is going to be negative.

00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:05.260
So you've got this imbalance.

00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:07.540
And this is how the
neuron stays quiet,

00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:11.080
how it make sure that
it is not firing.

00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:14.412
So you've got this cell sitting
there trying to figure out

00:29:14.412 --> 00:29:15.620
if it's going to fire or not.

00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:17.080
Right now it's quiet.

00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:20.590
How does the whole process
get started to make it fire?

00:29:20.590 --> 00:29:24.140
So if you have another
neuron up here--

00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:27.210
and you'll hear a lot more
about this from Anthony--

00:29:27.210 --> 00:29:31.770
sending out a chemical
signal, that chemical signal

00:29:31.770 --> 00:29:35.780
is going to get received
at the dendrites.

00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:40.700
And when that chemical-- called
a neurotransmitter-- hits

00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:44.720
a particular receptor
out on the dendrite,

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:47.580
that receptor is going
to open up a channel.

00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:53.950
And that channel is going to
let some of these positive ions

00:29:53.950 --> 00:29:55.410
in, just like receiving email.

00:29:55.410 --> 00:29:57.280
It's receiving a signal.

00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:01.470
So you get these positive
ions going into the dendrite.

00:30:01.470 --> 00:30:03.680
And you get a change in charge.

00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:06.610
The neuron is now getting
more positive on the inside.

00:30:06.610 --> 00:30:08.510
Before it was really negative.

00:30:08.510 --> 00:30:11.340
Now, it's getting a
little less negative.

00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:17.490
Another way to say that is it
was really polarized before.

00:30:17.490 --> 00:30:19.960
It had a big negative
charge on the inside.

00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:22.670
And now, it's getting a
little bit depolarized.

00:30:22.670 --> 00:30:25.361
It's getting some positive
charge going into it.

00:30:25.361 --> 00:30:25.860
Great.

00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:27.818
So you've got a little
bit of charge coming in.

00:30:27.818 --> 00:30:29.370
You've got a little
bit of signal.

00:30:29.370 --> 00:30:33.170
But somehow the neuron has to
decide, am I going to fire?

00:30:33.170 --> 00:30:34.370
Or am I not?

00:30:34.370 --> 00:30:36.860
It's all or nothing,
one or the other.

00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:39.980
So you get the signal coming
in from this dendrite.

00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:42.860
And you're going to get some
positive charge going in,

00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:45.160
flowing into the neuron.

00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:47.510
And you'll get a little
bit out in the cell body.

00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:51.710
But from one signal sent,
you might not get a lot.

00:30:51.710 --> 00:30:53.990
Well, let's say you're
getting really, really

00:30:53.990 --> 00:30:56.690
frequent chemical
messages from here,

00:30:56.690 --> 00:30:59.710
getting lots of positive
charge into the cell.

00:30:59.710 --> 00:31:02.200
Or you're getting several
different messages

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:04.510
at the same time, getting
lots of positive charge

00:31:04.510 --> 00:31:06.040
into the cell.

00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:10.540
Then, you can end up with
enough positive charge down here

00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:15.730
at the axon hillock to make
the neuron decide to fire.

00:31:15.730 --> 00:31:18.340
So what is it that
makes it decide?

00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:21.180
There are more
channels down here

00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:24.590
that can open up to let
more positive ions in.

00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:27.270
And the way they make that
decision is whether there's

00:31:27.270 --> 00:31:28.970
enough positive charge.

00:31:28.970 --> 00:31:31.560
If there's enough positive
charge, they open up.

00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:36.290
And they allow lots more of
this positive ion to go in.

00:31:36.290 --> 00:31:39.110
And once that happens,
it's going to feed forward.

00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:39.680
Right?

00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:42.187
You're going to get more
positive ion going in.

00:31:42.187 --> 00:31:44.270
You're going to get more
of these channels opening

00:31:44.270 --> 00:31:46.450
because the positive
ions are going in.

00:31:46.450 --> 00:31:48.750
And it's going to keep
going and feed forward.

00:31:48.750 --> 00:31:51.580
And you're going to get the
neuron sending a signal.

00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:53.500
And the way it does
that is it keeps

00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:57.270
having positive ions go in
all the way down the axon,

00:31:57.270 --> 00:31:59.540
all the way down
to the terminal.

00:31:59.540 --> 00:32:04.440
And then, when you get positive
ions going into the terminal,

00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:08.740
it's going to tell that
to go ahead and send

00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:10.790
a chemical message
on to the next cell

00:32:10.790 --> 00:32:13.770
and start the whole
process over again.

00:32:13.770 --> 00:32:16.260
But the big message
from all of this

00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:20.890
is that this decision that's
made here is all or nothing.

00:32:20.890 --> 00:32:23.750
You've got positive ions
that are traveling in.

00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:26.099
If they don't get to
the threshold here,

00:32:26.099 --> 00:32:27.640
if they don't get
enough of them here

00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:30.770
to make the axon hillock
decide to let more of them in,

00:32:30.770 --> 00:32:32.770
the cell's going to stay quiet.

00:32:32.770 --> 00:32:35.660
If they do get enough
in to reach threshold,

00:32:35.660 --> 00:32:38.252
then you're going to get
lots more pouring in.

00:32:38.252 --> 00:32:39.460
And the cell's going to fire.

00:32:39.460 --> 00:32:40.700
There's no turning back.

00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:43.870
It's going to send the signal
down its axon to the terminal.

00:32:43.870 --> 00:32:46.150
And you're going to get
the message sent on.

00:32:46.150 --> 00:32:48.710
And that's called
an action potential.

00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:51.980
And what happens here is you get
all this positive charge going

00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:52.820
in.

00:32:52.820 --> 00:32:56.090
You get the cell getting
to a really positive level

00:32:56.090 --> 00:32:57.590
of charge.

00:32:57.590 --> 00:32:59.550
And then, somehow
it has to stop.

00:32:59.550 --> 00:33:01.420
So how does it stop?

00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:05.430
You have a number of other
positive ions on the inside.

00:33:05.430 --> 00:33:06.970
And right after
this opens and you

00:33:06.970 --> 00:33:08.980
get all of these
ones pouring in,

00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:11.740
you can get the cell opening
up these other channels

00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:14.870
to let the positive ions,
a different kind of them,

00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:15.910
flow out.

00:33:15.910 --> 00:33:19.400
And then, you get restoration
of the balance and charge.

00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:21.580
And remember, you
have these pumps

00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:25.940
that continue to send the
positive ions out of the cell.

00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:28.510
So you get the cell being
restored to the quiet state

00:33:28.510 --> 00:33:31.520
afterwards where it's negative
on the inside compared

00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:33.426
to the outside.

00:33:33.426 --> 00:33:34.300
So there you have it.

00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:37.030
You have an all-or-nothing
action potential.

00:33:37.030 --> 00:33:40.050
You have the cell deciding
at the axon hillock

00:33:40.050 --> 00:33:41.900
whether it's going
to fire it or not

00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:45.300
and then sending the
message on to the next cell.

00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:48.910
So that's a really
basic understanding

00:33:48.910 --> 00:33:50.970
of how a neuron fires.

00:33:50.970 --> 00:33:53.410
Hopefully, that was basic
enough that everybody

00:33:53.410 --> 00:33:54.680
could understand it.

00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:57.440
You're going to hear more about
it later in other lectures.

00:33:57.440 --> 00:34:01.530
But for now, that should give
you a really basic overview

00:34:01.530 --> 00:34:03.360
of what's going on.

00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:05.950
So take-home messages
from this first part

00:34:05.950 --> 00:34:08.530
of the lecture, different
parts of the brain

00:34:08.530 --> 00:34:09.416
do different things.

00:34:09.416 --> 00:34:11.040
As we talked about
when we were looking

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:12.779
at the brain and
spinal cord, you've

00:34:12.779 --> 00:34:14.320
got the different
parts that function

00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:15.690
for different behaviors.

00:34:15.690 --> 00:34:17.699
You'll hear a lot more
about that in the future

00:34:17.699 --> 00:34:20.060
as we talk about
specific behaviors

00:34:20.060 --> 00:34:22.860
and what parts of the
brain have to do with them.

00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:24.760
You've also got
different cells that

00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:26.868
are doing different
functions within the brain.

00:34:26.868 --> 00:34:27.659
You've got neurons.

00:34:27.659 --> 00:34:28.325
You've got glia.

00:34:28.325 --> 00:34:30.820
You've got different
types of neurons as well.

00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:33.080
You'll hear a lot more
about how some neurons send

00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:35.784
one type of chemical
signal, some send another,

00:34:35.784 --> 00:34:37.159
and how that's
going to be really

00:34:37.159 --> 00:34:40.550
important to different
behaviors later on.

00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:43.810
You also learned that neurons
are individual cells making

00:34:43.810 --> 00:34:44.409
this decision.

00:34:44.409 --> 00:34:46.850
They're the functional
unit of the nervous system,

00:34:46.850 --> 00:34:49.300
as we learned from
Ramon y Cajal.

00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:51.920
And finally, when they do
decide to send that signal,

00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:53.900
it's an all-or-nothing process.

00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:56.360
It's an all-or-nothing
action potential

00:34:56.360 --> 00:35:00.547
that makes the sell send on
the message to the next one.

00:35:00.547 --> 00:35:02.380
So hopefully, if you
understood all of that,

00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:04.854
you have a really basic
understanding of neuroscience.

00:35:04.854 --> 00:35:06.520
We're going to take
a five minute break.

00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:08.644
And then, we'll move on to
Anthony's lecture, which

00:35:08.644 --> 00:35:11.290
will talk more about what
actually happens at the synapse

00:35:11.290 --> 00:35:14.440
as we think about
applying this to behavior.

00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:15.390
Thanks.

00:35:15.390 --> 00:35:21.102
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:35:21.102 --> 00:35:23.020
All right.

00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:24.440
My name is Anthony.

00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:28.860
I am a first year biology
student, a graduate student

00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:31.100
in the PhD program.

00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:32.780
Right now, I'm just
wandering from lab

00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:36.360
to lab trying to figure out
what I want to do research in.

00:35:40.290 --> 00:35:41.830
Again, like Nathan,
there's going

00:35:41.830 --> 00:35:46.150
to be some topics in here
that might confuse you.

00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:48.110
And if it is
confusing, let me know.

00:35:48.110 --> 00:35:49.300
Stop me.

00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:50.101
Ask questions.

00:35:54.380 --> 00:35:56.450
My email is on the
handout that you

00:35:56.450 --> 00:35:57.760
can download from CourseWorks.

00:35:57.760 --> 00:35:59.260
And after the
lecture, I'll actually

00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:01.330
write it down on the
bulletin board right there.

00:36:01.330 --> 00:36:06.460
But feel free to send me
or Nathan an email anytime

00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:08.630
if you have any questions
over the lectures today.

00:36:11.230 --> 00:36:13.950
I'm going to start by recapping
a little bit about what

00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:17.480
Nathan talked about,
the neuron doctrine.

00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:19.840
So up until the
late 1800s, neurons

00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:23.460
were all thought to be
connected by cytoplasm.

00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:26.090
And really the
concept of a neuron

00:36:26.090 --> 00:36:31.274
as an individual cell, it was
difficult to conceptualize.

00:36:31.274 --> 00:36:33.190
Because all people were
really able to observe

00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:35.990
was this mesh-like
network of interconnecting

00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:38.220
fibers and processes.

00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:42.070
And it wasn't until the
advance of microscopy

00:36:42.070 --> 00:36:45.930
and staining that people were
able to suspect that something

00:36:45.930 --> 00:36:48.020
else was going on here,
that maybe this story

00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:49.730
was a little bit different.

00:36:49.730 --> 00:36:55.140
In 1891, a German anatomist
named Heinrich Wihelm Gottfried

00:36:55.140 --> 00:36:56.420
von Waldeyer-Hartz--

00:36:56.420 --> 00:36:58.830
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:58.830 --> 00:37:04.441
I practiced that--
proposed what is now

00:37:04.441 --> 00:37:06.690
referred to as the neuron
doctrine, which is basically

00:37:06.690 --> 00:37:11.870
that this network was made
up of individual cells.

00:37:11.870 --> 00:37:14.460
He wasn't unable to
propose this without work

00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:18.430
done by many others,
including Santiago Ramon y

00:37:18.430 --> 00:37:20.262
Cajal, god of neuroscience.

00:37:24.670 --> 00:37:27.980
So if you have these separate
neurons that are separate

00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:30.120
cells, if one is to
communicate to another,

00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:34.670
it cannot happen by
electrical means only.

00:37:34.670 --> 00:37:37.260
If you think about it, if this
communication is to happen,

00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:40.500
it must happen by
chemical means.

00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:45.640
And so before the events at the
synapse can really take place,

00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:49.960
I have to introduce
you-- sort of back up

00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:52.580
and go back to the
action potential, which

00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:56.510
if you remember, starts
here at the axon hillock.

00:37:56.510 --> 00:38:00.010
So this is where the decision
to fire or not fire an action

00:38:00.010 --> 00:38:01.580
potential will be made.

00:38:01.580 --> 00:38:03.430
And once the action
potential is fired,

00:38:03.430 --> 00:38:06.510
it will travel along
the length of the axon

00:38:06.510 --> 00:38:08.520
and reach a dead end
that is conveniently

00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:11.290
called the axon terminal.

00:38:11.290 --> 00:38:15.890
Now, the axon terminal
is a structure

00:38:15.890 --> 00:38:20.980
at the end of the axon
that stores large amounts

00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:22.760
of neurotransmitters.

00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:24.450
And these neurotransmitters
aren't just

00:38:24.450 --> 00:38:29.790
freely floating or diffusing
around inside the cell.

00:38:29.790 --> 00:38:33.250
They're actually packaged
in these discrete quantities

00:38:33.250 --> 00:38:37.550
in these membranous spherical
structures called vesicles.

00:38:37.550 --> 00:38:43.140
And so you'll see those balls
housing these black dots.

00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:44.760
The balls are the vesicles.

00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:46.750
And the black dots are
the neurotransmitters.

00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:49.540
OK.

00:38:49.540 --> 00:38:54.930
So when the axon potential
reaches this axon terminal,

00:38:54.930 --> 00:39:00.010
it will trigger an influx
of positive charge, which

00:39:00.010 --> 00:39:03.562
will then trigger the
release of neurotransmitter

00:39:03.562 --> 00:39:04.395
from these vesicles.

00:39:04.395 --> 00:39:08.460
So the vesicles will move to
the edge of the axon terminal.

00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:12.530
And they'll dump their
neurotransmitter out.

00:39:12.530 --> 00:39:16.180
So I have to sort of dive into a
little bit of terminology here.

00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:18.140
We try to avoid that
with this class.

00:39:18.140 --> 00:39:24.070
But the signaling neuron is
called the presynaptic neuron.

00:39:24.070 --> 00:39:25.730
The neuron that
receives the signal

00:39:25.730 --> 00:39:28.010
is called the
postsynaptic neuron.

00:39:28.010 --> 00:39:30.110
And the junction at
which these two neurons

00:39:30.110 --> 00:39:32.641
connect and communicate
is called the synapse.

00:39:35.290 --> 00:39:38.640
So once this neuron is
bound to the receptor,

00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:43.860
it can trigger one of
two temporal effects.

00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:45.910
One can be an
immediate effect, which

00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:48.280
is the opening of
a channel, which

00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:53.470
will allow ions to jump in,
which Nathan illustrated

00:39:53.470 --> 00:39:55.530
earlier right here.

00:39:55.530 --> 00:39:59.060
These ions could either
be positively charged

00:39:59.060 --> 00:40:01.250
or negatively charged.

00:40:01.250 --> 00:40:02.920
If they're positively
charged, they

00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:05.230
will persuade an
action potential

00:40:05.230 --> 00:40:09.480
to happen if there are
enough of these charges.

00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:11.220
If it's a negative
charge, it might

00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:13.560
act to dissuade an
action potential to be

00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:15.250
initiated at the axon hillock.

00:40:17.780 --> 00:40:20.280
So that's the immediate effect.

00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:26.410
But an effect that might
last a little bit longer

00:40:26.410 --> 00:40:30.090
is when a genomic
effect is induced.

00:40:30.090 --> 00:40:32.560
So a neurotransmitter
might be released.

00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:34.890
And it might bind to a receptor.

00:40:34.890 --> 00:40:38.360
And this event might
influence the activation

00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:40.510
of a transcription factor.

00:40:40.510 --> 00:40:43.850
And this transcription factor
might induce the production

00:40:43.850 --> 00:40:48.220
of more receptor
channels that might find

00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:52.220
its way onto the dendrite here.

00:40:52.220 --> 00:40:55.790
So if you think about it, if you
produce more channels or more

00:40:55.790 --> 00:40:58.670
receptors, you can
make this synapse

00:40:58.670 --> 00:41:02.800
more responsive to the same
amount of neurotransmitter.

00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:06.040
So that's strengthening
the synapse.

00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:08.130
And you'll hear,
definitely, more about that

00:41:08.130 --> 00:41:12.235
later in future lectures.

00:41:15.710 --> 00:41:19.370
So not only can a single neuron
respond to many different types

00:41:19.370 --> 00:41:21.940
of neurotransmitters,
could be inhibitory,

00:41:21.940 --> 00:41:26.040
could be excitatory,
it is also possible

00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:29.040
for a single
neurotransmitter to have

00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:32.460
an effect on multiple
neuron types located

00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:37.430
in different areas of the
brain with different functions.

00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:41.020
And so you might ask yourself,
how is this possible?

00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:44.720
So we have like 100 billion
neurons in our brain.

00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:47.270
Why is it that we
don't have 100 billion

00:41:47.270 --> 00:41:51.820
unique neurotransmitters
for each brain-- or sorry,

00:41:51.820 --> 00:41:54.540
for each neuron?

00:41:54.540 --> 00:41:59.480
And the concept can
be sort of related

00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:02.080
to the concept of the alphabet.

00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:04.760
So we only have 26
letters in our alphabet.

00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:06.925
Yet, we can create an
infinite number of messages.

00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:17.280
The idea of the brain
having different functions

00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:21.790
in different areas,
each of these functions

00:42:21.790 --> 00:42:28.570
are going to be-- they're going
to have different functions

00:42:28.570 --> 00:42:31.040
because different neural
networks, different networks

00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:32.837
of neurons are going
to be responsible

00:42:32.837 --> 00:42:33.670
for these functions.

00:42:33.670 --> 00:42:36.290
And they are actually going
to, for the most part, have

00:42:36.290 --> 00:42:40.950
a physical separation
between different areas,

00:42:40.950 --> 00:42:44.090
different neural networks of the
brain with different functions.

00:42:44.090 --> 00:42:48.460
And so it is possible to use a
single type of neurotransmitter

00:42:48.460 --> 00:42:51.690
in many areas of the brain with
different functions because

00:42:51.690 --> 00:42:53.590
of this physical separation.

00:42:53.590 --> 00:42:54.090
Sorry.

00:42:54.090 --> 00:42:57.250
I was opposed to
put this slide up.

00:42:57.250 --> 00:42:59.990
So we call this
compartmentalization

00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:02.550
of the brain, many
different functions

00:43:02.550 --> 00:43:06.460
in many different
physical areas.

00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:10.540
And so because of this redundant
use of neurotransmitter,

00:43:10.540 --> 00:43:13.160
you really don't need
more than a few hundred.

00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:14.940
That's where the
current estimate lies.

00:43:17.579 --> 00:43:19.120
Not all of them have
been discovered.

00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:21.100
Quite a few have been.

00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:23.730
But there are still
a lot out there

00:43:23.730 --> 00:43:26.200
that have yet to be discovered.

00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:31.100
And so this brings me
to sort of a exercise

00:43:31.100 --> 00:43:35.010
that we could do to help hammer
in certain-- these properties

00:43:35.010 --> 00:43:36.790
of a neurotransmitter.

00:43:36.790 --> 00:43:38.940
Say you are a scientist.

00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:41.560
And say you are in the
business of identifying

00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:44.030
novel neurotransmitters.

00:43:44.030 --> 00:43:46.830
And you have this
putative molecule.

00:43:46.830 --> 00:43:49.400
And you want to prove to
the scientific community

00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:51.850
that this molecule is
a neurotransmitter.

00:43:51.850 --> 00:43:54.190
What pieces of
evidence might you

00:43:54.190 --> 00:43:57.880
need to provide to prove
that your molecule's

00:43:57.880 --> 00:43:59.776
a neurotransmitter?

00:43:59.776 --> 00:44:01.150
First thing that
you sort of have

00:44:01.150 --> 00:44:04.585
to do is you have to sort
of ask yourself, well,

00:44:04.585 --> 00:44:07.990
where are
neurotransmitters located?

00:44:07.990 --> 00:44:10.400
They are just located
anywhere in the brain.

00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:11.980
They're located
in specific areas.

00:44:11.980 --> 00:44:15.360
They're located in
the axon terminal.

00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:18.930
So you have to prove that it
localizes in the axon terminal.

00:44:18.930 --> 00:44:20.940
Another thing that
you might want to ask

00:44:20.940 --> 00:44:25.550
is, what triggers the action
of a neurotransmitter?

00:44:25.550 --> 00:44:28.320
So you're going to also have
to demonstrate its release

00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:29.810
following an action potential.

00:44:29.810 --> 00:44:31.434
So if you remember,
an action potential

00:44:31.434 --> 00:44:36.900
will hit the axon terminal
and through a series of events

00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:40.052
trigger the release
of neurotransmitter.

00:44:40.052 --> 00:44:41.760
And lastly-- but this
is not good enough.

00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:43.820
So you have two pieces
of evidence so far.

00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:46.750
But you need one more to make
a pretty strong case for why

00:44:46.750 --> 00:44:48.370
you have a neurotransmitter.

00:44:48.370 --> 00:44:50.720
And this is you have to
ask the question, what

00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:53.550
is the effect of a
neurotransmitter?

00:44:53.550 --> 00:44:56.200
And so you also have to prove
that after a neurotransmitter

00:44:56.200 --> 00:44:58.600
is released and it
binds to the receptor

00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:03.080
that it induces some
sort of influx of charge

00:45:03.080 --> 00:45:07.200
in the postsynaptic dendrite.

00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:08.690
And I just missed another slide.

00:45:08.690 --> 00:45:11.050
No I didn't.

00:45:11.050 --> 00:45:13.400
So fortunately for
us, a lot of this work

00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:16.090
identifying neurotransmitters
has already been done.

00:45:16.090 --> 00:45:20.025
And there are a few
notable transmitters,

00:45:20.025 --> 00:45:22.020
neurotransmitters that
I kind of want to get

00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:23.435
you guys familiarized with.

00:45:23.435 --> 00:45:26.097
And so right now, you
don't have to memorize

00:45:26.097 --> 00:45:28.180
any of the functions that
I'm going to talk about.

00:45:28.180 --> 00:45:29.670
So the whole purpose
is to sort of

00:45:29.670 --> 00:45:34.630
to introduce you to
some neurotransmitters

00:45:34.630 --> 00:45:36.920
so if you hear about
them in later lectures,

00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:40.960
it won't be the first
time you hear about them.

00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:44.400
So one type of neurotransmitter
is called dopamine.

00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:46.610
And it's most commonly
associated with the reward

00:45:46.610 --> 00:45:48.860
system, with pleasure.

00:45:48.860 --> 00:45:51.390
But dopamine, like many
other neurotransmitters,

00:45:51.390 --> 00:45:54.510
has a very diverse
array of functions.

00:45:54.510 --> 00:45:58.140
It's not just involved
in reward or pleasure.

00:45:58.140 --> 00:46:00.210
And so just a quick recap.

00:46:00.210 --> 00:46:03.220
How could it have many
different functions?

00:46:03.220 --> 00:46:06.160
Well, if the brain
is compartmentalized,

00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:08.860
if these networks are
physically-- for the most

00:46:08.860 --> 00:46:10.560
part physically
separated, you can

00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:13.370
have one type of
neurotransmitter

00:46:13.370 --> 00:46:16.860
with an effect in these
different areas of the brain.

00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:19.520
Therefore, one type of
neurotransmitter in an organism

00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:21.090
may have many
different functions.

00:46:21.090 --> 00:46:24.952
And dopamine is no
exception to that.

00:46:24.952 --> 00:46:26.660
You have another type
of neurotransmitter

00:46:26.660 --> 00:46:27.550
called epinephrine.

00:46:27.550 --> 00:46:30.210
And I know everyone in this
room has heard about it

00:46:30.210 --> 00:46:33.450
in one form or another.

00:46:33.450 --> 00:46:37.980
Another way to-- another word
for epinephrine is adrenaline.

00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:42.550
And so adrenaline is involved
in the fight or flight response.

00:46:42.550 --> 00:46:45.630
So if you're-- Nathan also
talked about this earlier--

00:46:45.630 --> 00:46:48.970
if you come across a risky
situation or you're feeling

00:46:48.970 --> 00:46:53.170
threatened you can either fight
off and vanquish your foe.

00:46:53.170 --> 00:46:56.962
Or you can flee, neither
of which are bad ideas.

00:47:00.235 --> 00:47:02.860
And norepinephrine, which
you may hear about later

00:47:02.860 --> 00:47:04.860
on in the course, is
pretty much interchangeable

00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:06.140
with epinephrine.

00:47:06.140 --> 00:47:08.050
They share a very
similar structure.

00:47:08.050 --> 00:47:11.100
And you don't really
need to do much to change

00:47:11.100 --> 00:47:15.340
epinephrine to norepinephrine
and vice versa.

00:47:15.340 --> 00:47:18.200
So another neurotransmitter that
you might hear about later on

00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:19.820
is serotonin.

00:47:19.820 --> 00:47:22.190
And serotonin again, is one
of those neurotransmitters

00:47:22.190 --> 00:47:24.770
that has a lot of functions.

00:47:24.770 --> 00:47:28.180
And few of them are
involved in the regulation

00:47:28.180 --> 00:47:31.530
of sleep, appetite, and mood.

00:47:31.530 --> 00:47:34.470
But certainly it's
not limited to those.

00:47:34.470 --> 00:47:38.150
Acetylcholine, I know you'll
hear about it on Friday.

00:47:38.150 --> 00:47:47.770
And so I'll leave that for
Friday for you to discover.

00:47:47.770 --> 00:47:50.960
GABA is-- and you really can't
talk about neurotransmitters

00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:53.600
without talking about
GABA and glutamate.

00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:57.340
So these are the two most common
neurotransmitters in the brain.

00:47:57.340 --> 00:48:01.140
GABA is the most common
inhibitory neurotransmitter.

00:48:01.140 --> 00:48:04.640
And glutamate is the most common
excitatory neurotransmitter.

00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:08.080
And again, these two have
very diverse functions

00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:10.710
and are involved in
many different areas.

00:48:13.790 --> 00:48:17.850
So I'm going to, for a brief
moment, dive into a tangent

00:48:17.850 --> 00:48:21.430
and tell you about the
neuromuscular junction.

00:48:21.430 --> 00:48:24.210
You cannot have animal
behavior-- in fact,

00:48:24.210 --> 00:48:27.590
you can't even behave
unless you are able to move.

00:48:27.590 --> 00:48:31.220
And the basis behind
movement lies in the muscle,

00:48:31.220 --> 00:48:33.780
in the contraction of muscles.

00:48:33.780 --> 00:48:36.820
So what you're going to see
here is a similar motif.

00:48:36.820 --> 00:48:38.210
You're going to see a synapse.

00:48:38.210 --> 00:48:40.435
You're going to see
a neurotransmitter.

00:48:40.435 --> 00:48:42.980
The synapse is going to
occur on the nerve that

00:48:42.980 --> 00:48:44.929
signals to the muscle.

00:48:44.929 --> 00:48:46.970
It's going to release the
neurotransmitter, which

00:48:46.970 --> 00:48:50.990
is actually going to be
oftentimes acetylcholine.

00:48:50.990 --> 00:48:53.020
And it's going to
bind to receptors

00:48:53.020 --> 00:48:56.900
in the muscle, which is going
to trigger a contraction.

00:48:56.900 --> 00:48:59.570
And so unlike many neurons
in the brain, which

00:48:59.570 --> 00:49:03.750
respond to multiple different
neurotransmitters in general,

00:49:03.750 --> 00:49:08.009
neuromuscular junctions
only use one type.

00:49:08.009 --> 00:49:09.550
So with that out of
the way, I'm sort

00:49:09.550 --> 00:49:13.350
of going to dive into
neuropharmacology.

00:49:13.350 --> 00:49:15.660
So what is neuropharmacology?

00:49:15.660 --> 00:49:20.080
It is the external manipulation
of synaptic events.

00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:23.460
Why would people want to
manipulate a synaptic event?

00:49:23.460 --> 00:49:27.338
Well, you can do it
for research purposes.

00:49:27.338 --> 00:49:30.500
You could manipulate
the neurotransmitter

00:49:30.500 --> 00:49:32.430
or the receptor
to figure out more

00:49:32.430 --> 00:49:34.680
about what their functions are.

00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:38.110
Or you could do it to
correct for disease states.

00:49:38.110 --> 00:49:41.890
We as humans are very interested
in trying to help people

00:49:41.890 --> 00:49:45.430
who have certain illnesses.

00:49:45.430 --> 00:49:50.300
So the general purpose is
to increase or decrease

00:49:50.300 --> 00:49:53.441
the strength of communication
across a synapse.

00:49:53.441 --> 00:49:56.210
So sometimes you can
do this by faking out

00:49:56.210 --> 00:49:58.160
the postsynaptic neuron.

00:49:58.160 --> 00:50:01.080
You can give it a compound,
an artificial compound that's

00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:04.446
not seen naturally
in the body that

00:50:04.446 --> 00:50:07.070
closely resembles something that
is seen naturally in the body.

00:50:07.070 --> 00:50:09.410
And you'll see a lot
of hallucinogenics

00:50:09.410 --> 00:50:11.520
that utilize this principle.

00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:16.910
So hallucinogenics, such as
mescaline, LSD, and psilocybin,

00:50:16.910 --> 00:50:18.340
these interact
with the serotonin

00:50:18.340 --> 00:50:21.850
receptors because they have very
similar structure to serotonin.

00:50:24.580 --> 00:50:27.390
And so there are a variety of
ways that you can strengthen

00:50:27.390 --> 00:50:30.720
the synaptic response.

00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:34.340
One of which is to increase
the release of neurotransmitter

00:50:34.340 --> 00:50:37.510
from the presynaptic neuron.

00:50:37.510 --> 00:50:39.090
How might you go
about doing this?

00:50:39.090 --> 00:50:42.800
You could increase the
synthesis of neurotransmitter.

00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:45.070
You could force
the release-- you

00:50:45.070 --> 00:50:47.180
could force the released
neurotransmitter

00:50:47.180 --> 00:50:49.110
to linger in the synapse.

00:50:49.110 --> 00:50:51.090
And there are a variety
of ways to do this.

00:50:51.090 --> 00:50:57.568
You could block-- wow, I
just skipped something.

00:50:57.568 --> 00:50:58.675
Oh, don't worry about it.

00:50:58.675 --> 00:50:59.175
OK.

00:50:59.175 --> 00:51:01.340
So you can block
reuptake or degradation.

00:51:01.340 --> 00:51:02.570
I can talk about it now.

00:51:02.570 --> 00:51:06.190
So when a neurotransmitter
has done its job,

00:51:06.190 --> 00:51:09.580
has bound to the
receptor, is used up,

00:51:09.580 --> 00:51:11.250
you can't just leave
it in the synapse.

00:51:11.250 --> 00:51:12.820
You've got to get
rid of it somehow.

00:51:12.820 --> 00:51:16.500
Otherwise, it's going to keep
signaling to the receptors.

00:51:16.500 --> 00:51:19.510
One way to do this is a
process called reuptake.

00:51:19.510 --> 00:51:21.240
This is essentially,
the reinsertion

00:51:21.240 --> 00:51:23.360
of a used up
neurotransmitter back

00:51:23.360 --> 00:51:26.600
into the presynaptic neuron.

00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:28.037
OK.

00:51:28.037 --> 00:51:29.620
And so there are a
variety of proteins

00:51:29.620 --> 00:51:30.880
that mediate this process.

00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:34.180
You can have protein pumps that
pump the neurotransmitter back

00:51:34.180 --> 00:51:35.240
into the presynapse.

00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:37.290
You can have-- you're
going to have proteins

00:51:37.290 --> 00:51:40.140
that are required to repackage
the neurotransmitters

00:51:40.140 --> 00:51:41.165
in the vesicles.

00:51:41.165 --> 00:51:42.790
And you're going to
be able to-- you're

00:51:42.790 --> 00:51:47.550
going to have to
reform these vesicles.

00:51:47.550 --> 00:51:49.640
And so this is called reuptake.

00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:53.650
You can also degrade used
up neurotransmitters.

00:51:53.650 --> 00:51:56.600
And when you do so, these
degradation products

00:51:56.600 --> 00:52:00.060
can be detected in certain
fluids in your body,

00:52:00.060 --> 00:52:04.220
such as cerebral spinal
fluid or blood or urine.

00:52:04.220 --> 00:52:05.600
And so this is
important for when

00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:08.740
you want to detect levels
of neurotransmitter

00:52:08.740 --> 00:52:12.740
when you're trying
to diagnose diseases.

00:52:12.740 --> 00:52:15.510
So right, so you can force
the released neurotransmitter

00:52:15.510 --> 00:52:17.970
to linger in the synapse
by blocking either reuptake

00:52:17.970 --> 00:52:20.300
or degradation.

00:52:20.300 --> 00:52:22.520
You can increase
neurotransmitter receptor

00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:24.190
activity.

00:52:24.190 --> 00:52:27.590
So if the receptor
on the postsynapse

00:52:27.590 --> 00:52:30.420
has a certain amount of affinity
to the neurotransmitter, if you

00:52:30.420 --> 00:52:32.490
are able to find some
way to make it bind

00:52:32.490 --> 00:52:34.600
more efficiently to
the neurotransmitter,

00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:37.640
you're able to amplify the
neurotransmitter signal

00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:41.710
and essentially, strengthen
that synaptic response.

00:52:41.710 --> 00:52:44.710
So conversely, if you would like
to weaken synaptic response,

00:52:44.710 --> 00:52:47.110
you could just block any
of the processes that

00:52:47.110 --> 00:52:49.494
are required to release
neurotransmitter, that

00:52:49.494 --> 00:52:51.035
are required for
the neurotransmitter

00:52:51.035 --> 00:52:55.095
to bind to the receptor and
trigger this influx of charge

00:52:55.095 --> 00:52:57.480
in the dendrite.

00:52:57.480 --> 00:53:01.040
So you can do that by blocking
neurotransmitter receptors,

00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:05.230
blocking
neurotransmitter release.

00:53:05.230 --> 00:53:10.730
You can block, or you can
decrease the receptor affinity.

00:53:10.730 --> 00:53:12.820
So again, we don't
really want you

00:53:12.820 --> 00:53:17.240
to focus on memorizing really
the many mechanisms of doing

00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:17.740
this.

00:53:17.740 --> 00:53:19.950
If you do need to know
it, it will come up later

00:53:19.950 --> 00:53:21.159
on in the course.

00:53:21.159 --> 00:53:23.200
But what this really is--
the whole point of this

00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:25.491
is to get you thinking about
the many ways in which you

00:53:25.491 --> 00:53:29.240
can manipulate events that
take place at the synapse.

00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:29.740
OK.

00:53:29.740 --> 00:53:34.590
So there are a lot of ways
people can manipulate it.

00:53:34.590 --> 00:53:43.200
So how would you find out more
about some neuropathology?

00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:45.460
If somebody has
something wrong with them

00:53:45.460 --> 00:53:47.430
and it's going on
in their brain,

00:53:47.430 --> 00:53:49.550
it's really difficult to
make direct measurements

00:53:49.550 --> 00:53:51.880
of neurotransmitters,
or neurotransmitter

00:53:51.880 --> 00:53:55.880
levels in their brain,
especially in a live patient.

00:53:55.880 --> 00:54:00.010
These measurements are often
done in breakdown products,

00:54:00.010 --> 00:54:02.480
breakdown products of
neurotransmitters in the urine,

00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:04.740
in the blood, or
cerebral spinal fluid.

00:54:04.740 --> 00:54:08.390
And these are often
serving as clues.

00:54:08.390 --> 00:54:11.830
These can often serve as clues.

00:54:11.830 --> 00:54:17.030
So if you had a patient with
Parkinson's and you would like

00:54:17.030 --> 00:54:19.540
to treat that patient
and alleviate that

00:54:19.540 --> 00:54:25.190
person's symptoms, you might
find it pretty difficult.

00:54:25.190 --> 00:54:27.810
So Parkinson's- people
with Parkinson's have

00:54:27.810 --> 00:54:31.080
an insufficient or decreased
level of dopamine in a certain

00:54:31.080 --> 00:54:34.090
area of their brain that
controls motor movement.

00:54:34.090 --> 00:54:39.150
And if you were to
increase, globally increase,

00:54:39.150 --> 00:54:42.420
dopamine levels in the
brain, you might fix,

00:54:42.420 --> 00:54:45.502
you might alleviate the
symptoms of Parkinson's.

00:54:45.502 --> 00:54:47.460
But you're going to be
increasing it everywhere

00:54:47.460 --> 00:54:52.720
else that dopamine has an
action in, has a function in.

00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:59.750
And so you might change levels
in the mesolimbic pathway

00:54:59.750 --> 00:55:04.910
from normal to too high
and induce symptoms

00:55:04.910 --> 00:55:07.520
that resemble schizophrenia.

00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:09.644
And so this really
harks back on the theme

00:55:09.644 --> 00:55:11.810
that we've been trying to
tell you that the brain is

00:55:11.810 --> 00:55:13.880
compartmentalized.

00:55:13.880 --> 00:55:16.920
It's got different functions
in different areas.

00:55:16.920 --> 00:55:19.170
It can have the same
neurotransmitter

00:55:19.170 --> 00:55:21.790
in these different
areas functioning.

00:55:21.790 --> 00:55:27.550
And if you were to treat
some sort of effect

00:55:27.550 --> 00:55:34.890
that you want to fix, you might
see adverse or deleterious side

00:55:34.890 --> 00:55:36.365
effects in other areas.

00:55:41.330 --> 00:55:46.432
Yeah, so that's pretty
much all I have.

00:55:46.432 --> 00:55:48.890
So there are a few take home
messages and important points.

00:55:48.890 --> 00:55:53.380
You have to know that
this process of axon--

00:55:53.380 --> 00:55:56.310
the process of action
potential moving along the axon

00:55:56.310 --> 00:56:01.060
and how it influences the
influx of positive ions

00:56:01.060 --> 00:56:04.620
at the axon terminal, which
will release neurotransmitter.

00:56:04.620 --> 00:56:07.410
So you have to be familiar
with that concept.

00:56:07.410 --> 00:56:09.870
You have to understand that
neurotransmitters after they're

00:56:09.870 --> 00:56:12.290
used up can be
degraded or recycled

00:56:12.290 --> 00:56:16.480
in a process called reuptake
and that degraded products can

00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:20.030
be detected in blood, urine,
and cerebral spinal fluid.

00:56:20.030 --> 00:56:22.720
You also have to understand
this idea, again,

00:56:22.720 --> 00:56:24.300
of compartmentalization.

00:56:24.300 --> 00:56:26.020
It's very important.

00:56:26.020 --> 00:56:29.950
And that pharmacological
manipulations,

00:56:29.950 --> 00:56:32.700
you have to be
careful because things

00:56:32.700 --> 00:56:36.610
could happen that you
are not expecting,

00:56:36.610 --> 00:56:39.040
especially when something
is wrong in only one

00:56:39.040 --> 00:56:41.830
area of the brain.

00:56:41.830 --> 00:56:48.150

to leave and/or ask questions.

00:58:12.030 --> 00:58:12.530
-No.

00:58:12.530 --> 00:58:14.230

on whether they're the ions

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.906
I'm a first year.

00:00:21.906 --> 00:00:24.030
And I study something that
you guys will eventually

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.890
hear about, but I don't
want to ruin the punchline.

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.680
But today we're going to talk
about memory and plasticity.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.520
And so two days
ago on Wednesday,

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.770
you guys all sat in
here, in this room.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.770
And you learned, some of
you for the first time,

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.520
some of you for maybe
the 10th time, the basics

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.700
of neurobiology, of
how a neuron works,

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.700
how a neuron-- you have
a presynaptic cell,

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.600
you have a postsynaptic
cell, and this kind

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.920
of simplified version of the
communication and information

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:52.490
transfer.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.629
And something
interesting happened

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.420
between now and then,
which is that now you

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:57.880
sit in the same room.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.660
And something about you knows
something about neuroscience

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.590
now.

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.140
You heard one of the TAs talk.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.270
You slept on it.

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.100
And then you come
back now and you

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.400
have assimilated, integrated
into your identity,

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.910
into what you know, new facts.

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:17.010
And this lecture is
about how you do that.

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.554
And to kind of get
at what memory is,

00:01:21.554 --> 00:01:23.470
we need to think about
a lot of different ways

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.150
in which it's interesting, and
a lot of different spectrums

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.850
and severities about memory.

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.600
So why is it that some
memories last our entire lives,

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.239
whereas other memories, we
hear and they're fleeting?

00:01:36.239 --> 00:01:37.280
They go away in a second.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.934
Why is it that someone
sitting next to you in bed,

00:01:41.934 --> 00:01:43.350
telling you a
story, and as you go

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.962
to sleep you can't remember it?

00:01:44.962 --> 00:01:46.920
As you wake up, you can't
remember your dreams.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.850
But if that exact same
person, that exact same story

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.950
was told to you as they were
sitting next to you in a car,

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.970
and you get into a
car accident, suddenly

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.230
that memory becomes salient.

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:58.540
You may remember it for years,
if not your entire life.

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:03.100
And you may actually associate
either the story itself,

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.100
the voice of the person,
with that traumatic event.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.509
And you might get
post-traumatic stress disorder.

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.820
So if the mechanism is
the same between these two

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.010
types of memory, between ones
that are fleeting and forgetful

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.960
and ones that last your
entire life, the question is,

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.070
how does environment,
how does context

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.390
fit into shaping these
types of memories?

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.490
And so in order to
understand that,

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.940
we have to kind of get at, what
are the mechanisms of memory?

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.300
And how are these
contextually motivated?

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.400
So I want introduce to you
first Stephen Wiltshire,

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.490
who is an architect, if not
in practice, at least in mind.

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.750
He is an autistic savant.

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.620
And he has been mute
since age three.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.210
And he has this remarkable
capacity, which I'm actually

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:57.640
going to test you guys on
slightly here, if you have

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.530
any kind of
inclination to sketch,

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.080
or you happen to have some
sketch paper with you.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.680
I want you to-- this will
take approximately 60 seconds

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.970
to span across all
of Rome-- draw it

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.510
from memory in your 60 seconds.

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.120
Because Stephen Wiltshire
has this amazing capacity

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.982
to take helicopter rides--
he's done this over Tokyo.

00:03:15.982 --> 00:03:17.190
He's done this over New York.

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.960
He's done this over
Rome and over London.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.600
And in 20 minutes,
he can then sit down

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.720
and recreate every single
building, every single column,

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.910
every single window in
correct proportions,

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.890
from the correct angle in
which the helicopter ride was.

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.740
And so you may be thinking-- OK,
your 60 seconds are almost up.

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.630
Can you guys do it?

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.620
You may be thinking-- if any
of you are artists out there,

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.690
you may be thinking
this is unfair.

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.640
Why can't I do this?

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.360
And as neuroscientists,
our first thought

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.100
is, OK, this is unfair.

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.000
Why can't I do this?

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.810
But really, it can
tell us something

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.430
interesting about memory.

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.670
So you come at it
with two questions.

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.640
First question-- before and
after this helicopter ride,

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.500
what is different
in Stephen's brain?

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.530
And second, on this theme
of individual variation

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.360
that we keep harping on in
class, why is it that he can

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.259
do this and we can't do this?

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:17.800
And these are two
important questions

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.540
that if we could
answer those questions,

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.079
we would know a lot
about what memory is.

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:30.860
And so it really
makes sense to go back

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.660
to what it is that we
know so far about neurons,

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.100
the basics of one neuron
and how it is activated.

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.240
And so we have a
presynaptic cell,

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.450
and we have a postsynaptic cell.

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:49.070
And in our simplified version,
we can kind of know now--

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.440
and what I'm going to
tell you is that memory,

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:56.400
learning happens, to the best of
our knowledge, in the synapse,

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.526
in the space between the pre
and the postsynaptic cell.

00:05:00.526 --> 00:05:03.150
But to understand why it is that
we think that, we kind of need

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.226
to go back about 100
years to when people,

00:05:07.226 --> 00:05:09.600
scientists, neuroscientists
were investigating the brain,

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:10.820
investigating memory.

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:15.870
And they thought that the
smallest unit of the brain

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:17.810
that they knew was the neuron.

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:21.720
So because of our
tendency to explain

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.830
what we don't know in terms
are the smallest unit of thing

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:26.530
that we do know,
they thought OK,

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:31.040
this makes sense-- a
memory is a new neuron.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.640
And when you learn
a new fact, when

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.890
you learn the basics
of neuroscience,

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:37.830
you are growing new neurons.

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:41.690
And each individual fact is
associated with one new neuron.

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:44.540
For instance, they
may have thought

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:47.100
that OK, you guys learned
on Wednesday that the axon

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:51.280
hillock is the site of the
generation of the action

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:52.120
potential.

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.875
So then that is a new
fact, and then a new neuron

00:05:54.875 --> 00:05:55.750
would then be formed.

00:06:00.877 --> 00:06:03.210
I just realized that that
actually might not make sense,

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:06.590
because at the time that they
thought that, they didn't know

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:09.890
what an axon hillock is,
so maybe that formulation

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:11.850
doesn't even make sense.

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:16.382
But the idea is that a
couple decades later, people

00:06:16.382 --> 00:06:17.340
discovered the synapse.

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:18.780
They discovered that
neurons were not just

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:20.696
one interconnected thing,
that there is space.

00:06:20.696 --> 00:06:21.930
There is a gap between them.

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:23.930
And as soon as they
discovered the synapse, that

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:26.510
then became the smallest
bit of information

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:27.840
we knew about the brain.

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:31.850
And then theories came out
saying, well, no, memory

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:34.110
must be the formation
of synapses.

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:39.540
So the dogma at the time was
then that OK, new fact, axon

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:40.380
hillock.

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:41.910
What does this
mean in the brain?

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:43.160
You can see this in the brain.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.460
This takes the shape of a
new synapse being formed.

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:52.200
And what we think of now is that
well, this isn't exactly right,

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:54.790
because new synapses are not
being formed all the time.

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:57.360
And new neurons are not formed
in the adult brain, which

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:59.540
isn't entirely true, but
we'll get back to that.

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:05.689
But the idea is just that
memory and storage of learning,

00:07:05.689 --> 00:07:07.980
what I'm going to tell you
is that it's in the synapse,

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:11.629
and that it involves modulation
and change of the synapse.

00:07:11.629 --> 00:07:12.670
And why do we think that?

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:15.790
Because we understand
the molecules.

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:17.614
And we understand
at a molecular level

00:07:17.614 --> 00:07:19.530
what's happening in a
synapse when it changes.

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:22.180
So that it is thus
now our smallest level

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:23.550
of understanding of the brain.

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:26.050
And so of course, we
think oh, well that's

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:29.030
probably where memory is.

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:32.150
So that's the dogma that
we're going to start with.

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:34.630
And we're going to
start with this idea

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:36.950
that memory is
synaptic plasticity.

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:39.890
Memory is when the
space between the

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:42.950
presynaptic and postsynaptic
neuron changes in some way.

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:45.360
And not only that, it
changes in one direction.

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:46.270
It gets stronger.

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:47.380
It's strengthened.

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:50.150
And so what this
means is that if you

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:53.620
have your presynaptic
neuron and you fire it,

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:58.000
and you get some
amount of response,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.090
that over time, if you give
enough presynaptic activation

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:06.040
in a certain time window, that
you will then get a heightened,

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:09.144
strengthened response in your
postsynaptic cell eventually.

00:08:09.144 --> 00:08:10.560
And that is the
kind of mechanism,

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:15.250
the overarching, broad
mechanism of LTP.

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:18.390
And so what we need to
do to understand memory

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:20.730
is to focus on the synapse.

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:23.180
So what we get is our
classical picture, which

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:24.560
is that you have your synapse.

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:27.210
And a neurotransmitter
is coming out.

00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:29.560
And that neurotransmitter
is excitatory.

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:33.500
And in your postsynaptic
cell, what you're getting is

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:35.360
you're getting a small
amount of activation.

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.590
You're getting current
that comes into that cell.

00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:40.490
You're getting ions,
some sort of response

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:45.250
for any individual piece
of neurotransmitter.

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:49.990
So what this is, is a
version, a simplified version,

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:52.040
of what is called
Hebbian plasticity.

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:54.260
And so there's this guy
Hebb, which you have to know.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.593
There's a few of names you
have to know in neuroscience,

00:08:56.593 --> 00:08:57.580
and he's one of them.

00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:01.537
And Hebb came up with this
idea, the only bumper sticker

00:09:01.537 --> 00:09:03.620
that neuroscientists ever
have on their car, which

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:07.480
is that neurons that fire
together wire together.

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:11.320
And what this is saying is that
you have your standard picture

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:13.700
of a very, very simplified
version of a presynaptic cell

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:16.800
that's releasing an
excitatory neurotransmitter,

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:19.390
and that when it does
so, you get a response

00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:20.550
in your postsynaptic cell.

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:29.010
So if you will remember
from one lecture ago,

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:33.220
that excitatory
neurotransmitter is glutamate,

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:35.440
though if you're going
to spend any time

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:37.670
and energy into remembering
one neurotransmitter that

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:39.440
might be relevant for
the class, this is

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:41.470
the one you want to remember.

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:43.360
You don't have to remember it.

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:46.177
So mostly, the idea is
just that it's excitatory.

00:09:46.177 --> 00:09:47.260
And why is this important?

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.510
Because information is
transferred in the brain

00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:50.830
through activation.

00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:52.700
And in order to
transfer information,

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:54.830
you need excitatory
neurotransmitters.

00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:58.200
You need your neurons
to be activated.

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:01.160
But as we know from
what I've told you

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:04.590
so far, that repetition
is what drives memory,

00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:08.470
I would suggest that you
remember that glutamate

00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:10.660
is the excitatory, and one
and only neurotransmitter

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:11.710
that you have to know.

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:14.750
Say there's a test
question that says,

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:16.550
what is the one excitatory
neurotransmitter

00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:18.008
in the brain that
you have to know?

00:10:18.008 --> 00:10:19.180
You would respond glutamate.

00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:21.800
And then you would be right.

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:26.110
And so you can imagine that
for this type of simplified

00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:27.769
diagram, if we
were to strengthen

00:10:27.769 --> 00:10:30.060
the synapse, if we were to
get some sort of plasticity,

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:32.840
some sort of change,
potentiation,

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:35.670
you could think of a
few ways of doing this.

00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:38.750
You could take the
presynaptic neuron

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:42.510
and change how much excitatory
neurotransmitter is released.

00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:44.870
You could change how much
glutamate is released.

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:48.110
And presumably, if you release
more of the little circles

00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:51.080
with positive charge
in them, then you're

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:55.850
going to get more activation
in the postsynaptic cell.

00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:59.040
Another thing you could
do is basic neurochemistry

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:02.120
in this diagram, is that each
of those neurotransmitters

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:04.670
is binding to a receptor
on the postsynaptic cell.

00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:08.640
And so what you can do is
take that individual receptor.

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:12.210
And you can make it respond more
to a single, individual unit

00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:15.300
quanta of neurotransmitter.

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:17.360
Alternately, you
could just increase

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:20.860
the number of postsynaptic
receptors on your cell.

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:23.150
And all of these would
be mechanisms by which

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:25.770
you could take this
very, very simple synapse

00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:30.560
and potentiate it, such that
you get the same release,

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:32.490
you get the same
neurotransmitter.

00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:35.180
And what you get is subtle,
because LTP is often

00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:36.130
very subtle.

00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:40.110
You'll just notice that the
response is slightly larger,

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:42.750
a slightly larger response
given the same amount of input,

00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:45.300
given the same amount of
output of the presynaptic cell.

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:49.710
And this is the entire idea of
LTP, long-term potentiation,

00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:52.750
this idea that at your
individual synapse,

00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:54.130
you can potentiate it.

00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:54.900
You can change it.

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:57.250
It is plastic.

00:11:57.250 --> 00:12:02.200
But there should be
one large red flag

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:08.820
here, which is--
one of these caveats

00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:11.150
is, well, your
presynaptic neuron,

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:14.640
how does it know whether or
not LTP should be undergone?

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:17.560
How does it know whether or
not LTP has been induced?

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:19.980
This requires a kind
of communication

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:23.430
between both the pre and
the postsynaptic cell,

00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:26.590
that how would the presynaptic
cell, which has already

00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:28.790
released its
neurotransmitter, know?

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:32.070
And what you get is this
kind of heretical type

00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:34.430
of neurotransmitter
that can actually-- we

00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:36.430
call it a retrograde
neurotransmitter--

00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:40.100
that can actually be sent back
from the postsynaptic cell.

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:41.550
And it's a gas.

00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:43.390
Nitric oxide is
an example of one.

00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:45.350
It's what you get
at your dentist.

00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:47.490
And it kind of goes
back and diffuses

00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:50.420
back across the synapse
and actually modulates

00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:52.470
how much neurotransmitter
gets released

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:54.220
from the presynaptic cell.

00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:58.080
So we have these mechanisms.

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:00.430
We have these mechanisms of LTP.

00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:05.520
And the question then is, where
does this happen in the brain?

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:07.610
And why is it that
we believe that these

00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:10.370
are the places of LTP?

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:12.880
And one of the things
you need to know--

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:15.310
this is our first dive
into neuroanatomy--

00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:17.590
is you need to know
the hippocampus.

00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:19.370
It was introduced
to you last lecture.

00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:21.372
But if there's one
neurotransmitter you

00:13:21.372 --> 00:13:22.580
need to know, it's glutamate.

00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:24.700
And if there's one neural
anatomical structure

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:26.908
you need to know at this
point, it's the hippocampus.

00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:34.140
I'm kind of always jealous of
these autistic savants that

00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:37.890
can memorize 10,000 digits of
pi, and take a helicopter ride

00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:42.120
and then fully recreate the
cityscape of any city they see.

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:44.450
And if you read interviews
about how they do it,

00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:46.130
it's really interesting.

00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:49.830
So what they seem to
do is not memorize

00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:52.410
just a sheet of a bunch of
digits, a string of 10,000

00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:53.510
digits of pi.

00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:57.630
They'll take a walk through
their childhood town.

00:13:57.630 --> 00:13:59.610
And they'll say that they
put one of the digits

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:01.184
on each and every object.

00:14:01.184 --> 00:14:02.850
So your mailbox will
be the first digit,

00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:04.840
and then your neighbor's
door will be another,

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:06.580
and then their
window will be three.

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:10.190
And then they are
not re-conceiving

00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:12.630
and reconstructing just a
sheet of boring numbers.

00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:18.030
They're taking spatial
tours through their memory.

00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:22.080
And what this always
compels me to do

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:24.464
is make these kind
of visual mnemonics.

00:14:24.464 --> 00:14:26.880
So I'm going to give you a
visual mnemonic for the one way

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:29.590
you have to remember
that the hippocampus is

00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:34.080
the site of memory
and the site of LTP,

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:36.440
insofar as this class is
concerned, which is-- OK,

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:37.860
hippo horse.

00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:40.360
We learned that last time, it
looks kind of like a seahorse.

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:42.382
But that doesn't
really make sense.

00:14:42.382 --> 00:14:43.590
What if you think about this?

00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:45.880
What if you think about the
hippodrome back in Rome?

00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:48.150
Hippodrome is the
circular arena where

00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:51.730
you had your little chariot
races, because of horses.

00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:54.126
And there's two
different scenarios

00:14:54.126 --> 00:14:55.250
that I want you to imagine.

00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:59.250
The first is-- you guys remember
Michael Jordan and Larry Bird?

00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:01.990
They had this commercial
where they played Horse.

00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:04.140
And what they were doing
is they were playing-- you

00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:06.530
have to make a basketball shot.

00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:08.500
And then the next one,
you have to remember

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:10.420
what that first
person did exactly,

00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:12.080
and you have to recreate it.

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:14.540
So what I like to imagine is
Larry Bird and Michael Jordan

00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:17.630
playing a game of horse in
the hippodrome, back in Rome.

00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:21.400
And then you can kind of
get this idea of how memory

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:22.659
is related to the hippocampus.

00:15:22.659 --> 00:15:23.700
and this horse structure.

00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:24.600
And if that doesn't
work for you,

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:25.810
I have one more,
which is actually

00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:27.430
my favorite, which
is you can imagine

00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:30.860
the entire amphitheatre,
the entire hippodrome filled

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:31.360
with people.

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:36.335
And there was that one emperor
who named his horse a senator.

00:15:36.335 --> 00:15:37.544
Do you guys know who that is?

00:15:37.544 --> 00:15:38.209
What's his name.

00:15:38.209 --> 00:15:39.150
I don't know his name.

00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:39.996
Caligula.

00:15:39.996 --> 00:15:41.400
Caligula, there you go.

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:44.700
So imagine the entire hippodrome
is filled with people.

00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:45.730
And Caligula is there.

00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:48.980
And he gets his senator horse
in the middle of the field.

00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:50.910
And the horse is sitting
kind of cross-legged.

00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:56.910
And he's typing out your
memoirs on a typewriter.

00:15:56.910 --> 00:15:59.120
And that is how you're
going to remember

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:01.640
that the hippocampus, the
hippodrome, the horse,

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:03.790
is where memory is formed.

00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:07.620
So now you guys are all
autistic savants now.

00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:13.420
Really though, what
we need to determine

00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:15.900
is, why is it that
we really think

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:19.720
that the hippocampus is the site
of LTP and memory formation?

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:24.150
It turns out that there is
actually adult neurogenesis

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:25.670
and adult plasticity.

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:28.410
So in the last 10
years, we've discovered

00:16:28.410 --> 00:16:31.160
that the adult brain really
does actually form new neurons.

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:33.810
And for the last 100 years,
we kind of disregarded that

00:16:33.810 --> 00:16:36.210
and said those guys
who initially believed

00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:39.497
that every new neuron is
associated with every new fact,

00:16:39.497 --> 00:16:41.580
those guys were just totally
wrong and ridiculous.

00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:43.220
What a ridiculous concept.

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:45.100
And so perhaps
eventually, in the future,

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:46.810
we will have to
incorporate this idea

00:16:46.810 --> 00:16:51.520
that there does seem to be
some neurogenesis in the brain.

00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:55.380
But much like how we
learned that there

00:16:55.380 --> 00:17:01.930
is non-genetic inherited
traits, which we had learned

00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:06.510
from the disreputable Lamarck,
way back in Lamarckian

00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:08.950
evolution, that there
is no-- for 100 years,

00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:10.460
we thought, no, it's impossible.

00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:14.079
There is no non-genetic
inheritance of traits.

00:17:14.079 --> 00:17:17.040
But it turns out
that, well, OK, we

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:20.060
do seem to have some kind
of non-genetic inheritance.

00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:22.778
And so Lamarck isn't
entirely wrong.

00:17:22.778 --> 00:17:25.069
And it turns out this is a
kind of similar thing, where

00:17:25.069 --> 00:17:28.950
the people of most disrepute are
often just a little bit right.

00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:31.050
So probably, people
that used to think

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:33.970
that adult neurogenesis has
something to do with memory

00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:36.770
are probably a little bit right.

00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:39.060
But we're going to stick
with the canon, which

00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:45.420
is that LTP happens,
and that it happens not

00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:47.920
on the level of the neuron, not
on the level of the synapse,

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:51.820
but on the level of the
plasticity of the synapse.

00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:54.110
And so why do we think
it's the hippocampus?

00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:57.160
We get at it from a few ways.

00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:01.080
The first way is that HM, this
kind of well-dressed epileptic

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:05.470
who had his hippocampi removed.

00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:07.400
And what happened was
he had selective removal

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:08.840
of just his hippocampi.

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:12.380
And he could no longer
remember anything at all.

00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:14.590
He could not form new
memories whatsoever.

00:18:14.590 --> 00:18:18.130
So with these types
of conclusions,

00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:23.200
in addition to evidence
that if you watch and record

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:26.080
from neurons in the hippocampus
as you're giving someone

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:30.040
a learning task,
then you see LTP.

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:33.040
If you pharmacologically
block LTP,

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:36.300
you see changes in
the hippocampus.

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:37.760
And so all these
pieces of evidence

00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:41.800
are trying to get at the
idea that the hippocampus is

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:45.710
necessary for memory and
memory consolidation.

00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:48.540
But if you introspect
a little bit,

00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:51.880
you can probably
realize that well, we

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:54.610
undergo all kinds of forms
of learning and memory.

00:18:54.610 --> 00:18:55.800
We have motor learning.

00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:57.350
We learn how to shoot baskets.

00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:59.300
We learn how to throw darts.

00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:04.120
We understand
emotionally that events

00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:07.110
that are more emotionally
salient are more memorable.

00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:09.370
And so how is it that
these types of things

00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:12.580
are also encoded
in our brain, also

00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:15.420
encoded in the same region, the
one region, the hippocampus?

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:17.950
And what that turns out
to be is that, well, it's

00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:19.040
not just that one region.

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:21.370
LTP is happening
all over the brain,

00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:24.710
that if you look in your
emotional regulation centers,

00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:28.420
if you look in your emotional
cortices, you also see LTP.

00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:31.750
And this makes sense, because
these types of memories

00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:35.910
have to have different methods
of storage and retrieval.

00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:43.910
And also, that you can imagine
this type of excitation,

00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:49.520
this type of synaptic
plasticity, can go wrong.

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:51.250
In post-traumatic
stress disorder,

00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:53.300
for instance, you get LTP.

00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:55.690
And you get LTP that is severe.

00:19:55.690 --> 00:19:58.900
And you get severe LTP
potentiation of your synapses

00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:01.800
in those emotion
regulation centers that

00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:06.510
create a situation where the
context leads to memories that

00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:08.950
shouldn't necessarily
be brought up,

00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:11.040
that shouldn't
necessarily be retrieved.

00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:16.290
And so we see this mechanism for
types of behavior that we know,

00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:19.874
types of things like
why certain memories,

00:20:19.874 --> 00:20:22.290
certain emotionally salient
memories last for a long time,

00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:23.460
and others don't.

00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:28.820
And we can also
imagine that this

00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:30.630
is a physiological
process, and that it

00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:33.640
can go wrong, occasionally.

00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:35.520
We all know that
memories are degraded,

00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:38.267
sometimes intentionally so,
sometimes unintentionally so,

00:20:38.267 --> 00:20:40.350
that there are certain
things we want to remember.

00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:43.060
And despite any and all
repetition about glutamate

00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:44.540
being the excitatory
transmitter,

00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:45.850
we just don't remember them.

00:20:45.850 --> 00:20:50.240
And there are some that just
kind of fade away into time,

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:51.950
into the oceans.

00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:54.910
And what is happening
is that there

00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:58.680
are mechanisms for
intentional disruption of LTP.

00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:00.330
And you can think of a few.

00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:05.190
So hypoglycemic states, if
you are really, really hungry,

00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:09.624
you get insulin cascades
that end up reducing LTP.

00:21:09.624 --> 00:21:11.290
If you're starving,
it's not a good time

00:21:11.290 --> 00:21:12.476
to try to remember things.

00:21:12.476 --> 00:21:13.850
It's a good time
to try to go out

00:21:13.850 --> 00:21:15.925
and expend energy finding food.

00:21:15.925 --> 00:21:17.300
As we'll learn
later in lectures,

00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:19.400
there are some stress hormones.

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:21.680
And these stress
hormones actually

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:25.420
give us a selective memory
advantage in the short term.

00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:28.050
If you're in a car crash,
you remember the slow motion

00:21:28.050 --> 00:21:30.084
details of the entire event.

00:21:30.084 --> 00:21:32.000
And this has to do with
these stress hormones,

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.650
these fear hormones
coming out and saying,

00:21:34.650 --> 00:21:37.460
OK, well, we want to be
able to remember this moment

00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:40.450
so we can learn from it
next time, if we survive.

00:21:40.450 --> 00:21:44.140
But if you do this chronically,
if you do this for a long time

00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:47.120
window throughout the
lifetime of the organism,

00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:50.560
then you can actually get damage
to LTP and damage to memory.

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:51.870
So it's about time window.

00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:54.240
It's about the same
mechanisms that

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:57.225
can enhance memory can also
be deleterious eventually.

00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:05.290
Another probably
more familiar one,

00:22:05.290 --> 00:22:08.170
perhaps not to the
introverts, but perhaps

00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:09.630
to the extroverts
in the crowd, is

00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:12.980
that if this lecture
were on Saturday morning,

00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:15.440
I could probably ask you
guys what you did last night.

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:17.490
And some of you would
not be able to tell me

00:22:17.490 --> 00:22:21.920
with delicate accuracy
what happened on Friday.

00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:24.720
And you might not be
able to tell me the story

00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:26.820
that was read to you
at bedtime, or even

00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:28.900
who read you the
story at bedtime.

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:35.890
And this is because ethanol,
alcohol, directly disrupts LTP.

00:22:35.890 --> 00:22:36.660
And we see this.

00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:37.930
And we see this in
the hippocampus.

00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:39.805
And these are the types
of things, behaviors,

00:22:39.805 --> 00:22:41.120
that we know of.

00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:43.860
We know that emotionally
salient memories last longer.

00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:46.540
We know that alcohol
somewhat-- there

00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:50.392
are differential effects of
types of substances on memory.

00:22:50.392 --> 00:22:52.350
We know that it's hard
to remember things right

00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:53.660
before we go to sleep.

00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:55.570
And so what's
interesting is, can we

00:22:55.570 --> 00:22:58.740
get at a physiology that
explains all of these things?

00:23:01.601 --> 00:23:03.850
And so I'm going to give you
60 more seconds-- there's

00:23:03.850 --> 00:23:05.266
going to be a pop
quiz at the end,

00:23:05.266 --> 00:23:07.960
by the way-- you have 60
more seconds to do this.

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:13.680
And what is interesting here
is that when we get down

00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:16.050
to these physiological
mechanisms,

00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:17.510
we have two ends of a spectrum.

00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:20.750
We have HM and we have
Stephen Wiltshire,

00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:23.630
someone who cannot form
any memories whatsoever,

00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:27.570
and then someone who can do this
in a 20-minute helicopter ride,

00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:29.180
recreate the entire landscape.

00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:31.170
And the question is,
the theme of this class

00:23:31.170 --> 00:23:33.400
is often one of
individual variation.

00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:36.820
How is it that
one person can not

00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:38.850
be able to form any
memories whatsoever?

00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:40.510
How is it that one
person can have

00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:42.750
an autistic,
photographic memory?

00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:45.270
And where do we fit?

00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:50.770
Where does memory fit in a
properly functioning way?

00:23:50.770 --> 00:23:53.880
And like most of
the spectrums that

00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:56.760
are introduced into
this class, one

00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:59.600
of imprinted genes, tournament
versus pair-bonding species,

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:01.650
things like that, the
answer turns out to be we

00:24:01.650 --> 00:24:05.060
are somewhere in the
middle between HM,

00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:07.150
no hippocampi, no
formation of new memories,

00:24:07.150 --> 00:24:09.480
and Stephen Wiltshire.

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:16.560
So one more thing
we need to discuss

00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:19.620
with the theme of this
class is that often, we'll

00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:21.870
give you a lecture and then
maybe in the next lecture,

00:24:21.870 --> 00:24:25.440
maybe five minutes later,
we'll tell you it's all wrong.

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:28.230
Or we'll say, no, you've
been way too myopic.

00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:30.640
That's not how you
should see these things.

00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:33.370
And what we need to do in
order to understand somewhat

00:24:33.370 --> 00:24:36.700
about the context of memories
is to take and expand

00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:39.920
your myopic view of this
simplified version of a neuron.

00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:43.680
So far, we've gone into
what a single neuron

00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:45.780
functioning looks like.

00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:48.560
And we've gone into what a
single neuron as it transmits

00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:51.250
a signal to another
neuron looks like,

00:24:51.250 --> 00:24:54.320
how there's a gap in between the
pre and the postsynaptic cell,

00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:56.730
and what that information
transfer looks like,

00:24:56.730 --> 00:24:59.080
and how we can change that
information transfer, how

00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:00.650
we can make it plastic.

00:25:00.650 --> 00:25:03.860
But there's a
problem here, which

00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:06.670
is that if we're trying to
learn anything about the brain,

00:25:06.670 --> 00:25:10.700
we have to understand that the
brain is really complicated,

00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:13.110
and that there's
100 billion neurons,

00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:16.350
and that sometimes these
individual neurons will connect

00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:18.800
to 10,000 other neurons.

00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:21.300
And sometimes, each of
those 10,000 neurons

00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:24.300
will have 10,000 neurons
that connected to it.

00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:29.800
And so the question--
I don't know.

00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:32.570
As a neuroscientist, when I look
at that, the first thing I do

00:25:32.570 --> 00:25:33.650
is want to give up.

00:25:33.650 --> 00:25:35.270
And I do.

00:25:35.270 --> 00:25:39.940
And then the second
thought is OK, maybe

00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:42.500
it's time to expand
the simplified version

00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:43.860
of the neuron that we have.

00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:46.200
It's not just one neuron
talking to another neuron.

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:48.710
It's not just a single
synapse, but that it's

00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:52.180
the dynamics of many,
many interacting neurons.

00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:59.420
And as these dynamics
expand, as these dynamics

00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:02.440
get introduced into 10,000
neurons at the same time,

00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:04.920
10,000 dendrites,
dendritic arbors

00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:08.420
connecting to 10,000
other axonal processes,

00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:10.950
then we see that things
that didn't matter

00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:13.217
so much in the single,
individual neuron actually

00:26:13.217 --> 00:26:14.800
matter quite a bit
when you're talking

00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:17.150
about 100 billion neurons.

00:26:17.150 --> 00:26:20.590
So one of the things
to introduce here

00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:24.880
is the concept of noise into
the individual signal transfer,

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:26.930
into the individual
information transfer.

00:26:26.930 --> 00:26:30.190
A neuron, as we
presented it, was

00:26:30.190 --> 00:26:32.810
something that fires
an action potential,

00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:34.030
transmits information.

00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:35.780
Every single action
potential leads

00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:37.480
to neurotransmitter
release, which

00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:40.160
leads to postsynaptic response.

00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:43.300
But these are very
delicate things.

00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:45.690
An individual
neuron is constantly

00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:48.340
in flux with how much
current is coming in and out.

00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:50.330
Ions are flowing around.

00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:54.140
It's not as simple as
a static neuron that

00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:56.330
then gets activated,
and then passes on

00:26:56.330 --> 00:26:58.530
a message to another
static neuron, which

00:26:58.530 --> 00:26:59.670
then gets activated.

00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:01.680
What you get is
often, a lot of times,

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:05.270
you'll get random and
spontaneous generation

00:27:05.270 --> 00:27:09.370
of signal, of action potentials,
and sometimes of current

00:27:09.370 --> 00:27:11.070
in the postsynaptic cell.

00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:15.060
And one of the major
tasks of the brain

00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:20.310
is figuring out
what is signal, what

00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:25.490
is appropriate and meaningful
signal, versus what

00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:26.330
is this noise.

00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:28.600
If you can imagine on
a single neural level,

00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:30.450
the noise might not
have that much impact.

00:27:30.450 --> 00:27:33.290
But if you're talking
about 100 billion neurons,

00:27:33.290 --> 00:27:36.790
you're going to get noise all
over the place that will just

00:27:36.790 --> 00:27:40.432
lead to this static of noise
that you don't know what

00:27:40.432 --> 00:27:41.640
to make of the world anymore.

00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:43.389
You don't know what
to make of the signal.

00:27:43.389 --> 00:27:48.090
You don't know what to make
of individual neural signals.

00:27:48.090 --> 00:27:52.540
And so what we need to do is
to start considering neurons

00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:58.180
in terms of how they interact
in dynamics of groups.

00:27:58.180 --> 00:28:01.110
And one of the first ways
and the most important ways

00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:04.080
to think about this
is to understand

00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:07.610
that neurons are not just
excitatory forces, that

00:28:07.610 --> 00:28:10.410
information, yes, is
generated by glutamate

00:28:10.410 --> 00:28:14.650
and the transfer of
excitation, but that neurons

00:28:14.650 --> 00:28:18.310
have a capability to inhibit.

00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:23.330
And one of the important ways
that they differentiate signal

00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:26.340
from noise, one of the important
ways to learn what is noise

00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:29.280
and what is not, is to inhibit.

00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:30.717
And I'll explain
how it is exactly

00:28:30.717 --> 00:28:31.800
that the inhibition works.

00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:34.510
But one of the first--
oh, that's pretty high.

00:28:34.510 --> 00:28:36.440
One of the first
ones to understand

00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:43.162
is that a neuron can inhibit
itself, which is not really--

00:28:43.162 --> 00:28:45.620
it seems like it could initially
be some sort of masochism,

00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:46.650
but it's really not.

00:28:46.650 --> 00:28:50.270
It's just that the neuron
is trying to sharpen

00:28:50.270 --> 00:28:51.940
the signal that it's sending.

00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:54.490
So a neuron is firing
and firing, over and over

00:28:54.490 --> 00:28:56.440
and over, and what
it wants to say,

00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:59.600
what it wants to be able
to do, is accurately give

00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:04.620
a precise description of the
signal, of the information.

00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:07.900
And what it can do is inhibit
itself to say, I'm done.

00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:09.360
No more spontaneous noise.

00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:12.220
No more spontaneous
little bits of current.

00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:14.380
I am done with my signal.

00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:17.530
And what this is, is it allows
for temporal sharpening.

00:29:17.530 --> 00:29:21.270
It allows for the ability
of a neuron to say,

00:29:21.270 --> 00:29:22.230
this was my signal.

00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:23.070
It was meaningful.

00:29:23.070 --> 00:29:26.490
I really meant it,
and inhibit the kinds

00:29:26.490 --> 00:29:30.290
of random noise and spontaneous
things that could happen.

00:29:30.290 --> 00:29:32.780
Another type of
inhibition that's

00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:36.030
very important to separate
noise from not noise

00:29:36.030 --> 00:29:37.480
is spatial inhibition.

00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:40.830
So what this is, is
your individual neuron,

00:29:40.830 --> 00:29:45.460
not only can it send
processes and inhibit itself,

00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:48.760
it can actually send processes
out and inhibit its neighbors.

00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:55.400
And how might this be useful and
important is that it can say,

00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:58.989
essentially, OK,
this signal is real.

00:29:58.989 --> 00:30:00.530
This signal is the
signal that I want

00:30:00.530 --> 00:30:02.990
to send, the information
that I want to transfer.

00:30:02.990 --> 00:30:05.600
And not only that,
ignore my neighbors.

00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:07.830
It's really me.

00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:12.500
And what this allows you to
do is get spatial sharpening.

00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:18.470
So what this allows you to do
is say, in the field of things

00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:21.260
that you're trying to
perceive, a certain neuron

00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:25.460
will respond to a certain
section of that field.

00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:29.930
And what this is saying
is, I am activated.

00:30:29.930 --> 00:30:31.720
And you inhibit
your neighbors so

00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:34.310
that you're more sure
that your signal is true.

00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:36.880
And how can we relate this?

00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:38.620
How can we make sense of this?

00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:43.270
There's a very simple
type of feedback network

00:30:43.270 --> 00:30:46.770
that should elaborate
this idea, which

00:30:46.770 --> 00:30:48.590
is pain and pain sensation.

00:30:48.590 --> 00:30:51.370
And so we all probably, at
some point in our lives,

00:30:51.370 --> 00:30:54.420
presumably, have
discovered and felt pain.

00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:58.210
And there's two general
qualities of pain.

00:30:58.210 --> 00:31:00.310
You can have really,
really fast, sharp pain.

00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:02.830
And you can have this dull,
aching, throbbing pain.

00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:05.330
And what people found
when they investigate

00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:08.110
into your spinal cord and
into your sensory peripheral

00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:10.750
processes is how this
pain is generated.

00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:13.850
And it's generated on two
separate types of neurons.

00:31:13.850 --> 00:31:17.410
And one carries fast pain, one
carries the sharp, fast stuff.

00:31:17.410 --> 00:31:20.280
One carries the
slow, dull stuff.

00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:24.090
And what you find is that
these are intertwined

00:31:24.090 --> 00:31:26.470
in this delicate
feedback loop, such

00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:33.500
that the fast, spiking,
first pain will generate,

00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:35.720
eventually, the
slow-moving pain.

00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:39.660
It will fire the other neurons
next to it, the neighbors,

00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:42.960
and say, OK, also start
this slow pain spike.

00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:45.870
But then the slow pain
spike can come back

00:31:45.870 --> 00:31:52.840
and inhibit the first sharp
spike, such that it stops.

00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:54.840
We're trying to get
information about the world.

00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:56.972
And your body is
trying to do what

00:31:56.972 --> 00:31:58.180
it can with that information.

00:31:58.180 --> 00:32:00.530
And if you get
stung by something,

00:32:00.530 --> 00:32:02.250
you want really sharp
pain to be like,

00:32:02.250 --> 00:32:03.375
hey, pay attention to that.

00:32:03.375 --> 00:32:05.750
Make sure it's not a
scorpion that's still there.

00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:07.749
But you don't need this
sharp pain forever.

00:32:07.749 --> 00:32:10.040
You want to be able to inhibit
it and just say, OK, pay

00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:10.870
attention.

00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:12.884
But then, just to make
sure you don't walk on it

00:32:12.884 --> 00:32:14.300
anymore and get
it infected, we're

00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:15.940
going to make it
hurt a little bit.

00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:18.440
And so this is your body
trying to make the most

00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:19.750
of this type of information.

00:32:19.750 --> 00:32:22.300
And what it's doing is
using lateral inhibition

00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:25.040
in this complicated way,
actually simple way,

00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:33.740
to allow for these two types of
transmissions of information.

00:32:33.740 --> 00:32:35.130
That was a very simple example.

00:32:35.130 --> 00:32:37.970
And I think there's a much
more complex example when

00:32:37.970 --> 00:32:42.860
we go into the types of
complex visual stimuli

00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:45.360
that vision gives us.

00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:49.980
And you can imagine that lateral
inhibition, the same type

00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:52.074
of spatial sharpening
of a signal,

00:32:52.074 --> 00:32:54.490
can come into play as we're
trying to figure out and piece

00:32:54.490 --> 00:32:55.840
together the visual world.

00:32:55.840 --> 00:33:00.680
So what this is doing, what
this kind of lateral inhibition

00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:05.640
allows for, is it allows for
visual neurons to receive input

00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:09.040
and then to say, it is me.

00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:10.860
This is the signal
that I want to send.

00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:13.710
Not only that,
inhibit the neighbors.

00:33:13.710 --> 00:33:16.150
And what this leads to
is this emergent property

00:33:16.150 --> 00:33:19.890
of these retinal
cells that allow

00:33:19.890 --> 00:33:23.500
for specific types
of signal and allow

00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:26.290
for specific types
of receptive fields.

00:33:26.290 --> 00:33:31.020
So in your eyes, your neurons
in the back of your eyes,

00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:32.830
if you just stand
still, they only

00:33:32.830 --> 00:33:35.600
have a certain angle of
light that they can get.

00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:38.740
And that idea is this
idea of receptive fields,

00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:41.580
that they are responsible
for that field.

00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:43.194
And they're
responsible for saying,

00:33:43.194 --> 00:33:45.110
if there's a signal
there, this is what it is.

00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:46.720
And this is how it's relevant.

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:51.180
And what this type of lateral
inhibition allows you to do

00:33:51.180 --> 00:33:52.435
is it allows you to say, OK.

00:33:55.450 --> 00:33:57.670
Your neuron gets
a signal, and it

00:33:57.670 --> 00:33:59.780
wants to say, OK,
that's an edge, an edge

00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:01.740
detection, contrast detection.

00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:03.860
If you look around at
the objects in the room,

00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:07.630
often you define
them by their edges.

00:34:07.630 --> 00:34:10.650
So we have this elaborated
neural mechanism

00:34:10.650 --> 00:34:12.310
involving inhibition
and excitation

00:34:12.310 --> 00:34:15.312
that allows for this type
of contrast enhancement.

00:34:18.469 --> 00:34:25.730
And what can we do
with this even more?

00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:30.900
So these guys Hubel
and Wiesel decided

00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:34.770
that they were going to look--
OK, another brief anecdote.

00:34:34.770 --> 00:34:37.760
So there's this commercial
when I was young.

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:40.040
And it was Michelin Tires.

00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:42.989
And if any of you guys ever
become marketing people,

00:34:42.989 --> 00:34:45.550
which there's enough of you that
statistically, someone will.

00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:48.340
I don't know why you
don't make commercials

00:34:48.340 --> 00:34:51.540
that are scary, because this
commercial frightened me.

00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:52.620
And I was, like, six.

00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:54.030
And I remember it to this day.

00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:56.405
So why not, if you want someone
to remember your product,

00:34:56.405 --> 00:34:58.517
just make it-- take
what you know from this,

00:34:58.517 --> 00:34:59.850
and use it to manipulate people.

00:34:59.850 --> 00:35:01.640
That's what education is.

00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:04.690
And so I remember
this commercial.

00:35:04.690 --> 00:35:06.860
And I just remember it
was for Michelin Tires.

00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:08.960
And their whole point was
that no matter how fancy

00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:11.550
your car is, no matter how
much you spend on your car,

00:35:11.550 --> 00:35:13.210
there's only four
points of contact

00:35:13.210 --> 00:35:15.530
between you and the road.

00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:16.740
And it's on your tires.

00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:19.323
And I don't know why, but this
blew my mind, and it scared me.

00:35:19.323 --> 00:35:21.040
And it made me recognize
that, yeah, you

00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:23.590
should get good tires.

00:35:23.590 --> 00:35:28.750
So Hubel and Wiesel, they took
essentially the same logic,

00:35:28.750 --> 00:35:31.770
which is that we have this
complicated visual world,

00:35:31.770 --> 00:35:34.500
and we know that we put
it together somehow,

00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:36.310
but our only access
to this information

00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:37.930
is through the retina.

00:35:37.930 --> 00:35:41.470
We have the light is the road.

00:35:41.470 --> 00:35:42.580
These are our two tires.

00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:46.340
We only have two tires
to connect with the road.

00:35:46.340 --> 00:35:49.010
And so their logic
was that if we

00:35:49.010 --> 00:35:52.130
look at each individual
neuron in the retina

00:35:52.130 --> 00:35:55.180
and trace it back, we should
be able to see, somehow,

00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:57.080
how this visual
world is constructed,

00:35:57.080 --> 00:36:00.100
how it is that we go from the
only signal, the only signal

00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:01.530
from the outside
world we get, to

00:36:01.530 --> 00:36:04.150
this complicated visual field.

00:36:04.150 --> 00:36:09.230
And what they found
was that if you

00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:12.110
look at the neurons in
the back of a retina,

00:36:12.110 --> 00:36:16.620
and then look at where
they synapse, back

00:36:16.620 --> 00:36:18.870
in your visual
cortex, they found

00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:21.800
a one-to-one correspondence,
that if you activate

00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:23.800
a certain neuron in
your retina, you'll

00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:27.450
get a spatiotopic-- which
means they're oriented

00:36:27.450 --> 00:36:29.380
in the same way,
and all the neurons

00:36:29.380 --> 00:36:32.470
are aligned in a
similar way-- field

00:36:32.470 --> 00:36:34.804
in the back of your
visual cortex, in V1.

00:36:34.804 --> 00:36:36.220
And so what that
essentially means

00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:39.540
is that your eyes are smushed
to the back your head.

00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:43.170
There's no information that
necessarily gets enhanced

00:36:43.170 --> 00:36:46.060
or reduced between your
retina and the back

00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:47.120
of your visual field.

00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:49.040
And they're like, OK, great.

00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:54.200
And so these guys, Hubel and
Wiesel, won the Nobel Prize.

00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:56.140
If you could win more
than one, they probably

00:36:56.140 --> 00:36:57.600
would have won four by now.

00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:01.590
They were these Harvard
neuroscientist back in the day.

00:37:01.590 --> 00:37:06.660
And they are pretty much
who you need to know.

00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:08.160
You need to know Hebb.

00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:10.070
You need to
understand glutamate.

00:37:10.070 --> 00:37:11.390
You need to understand LTP.

00:37:11.390 --> 00:37:14.114
And Hubel and Wiesel, if you're
going to be a neuroscientist,

00:37:14.114 --> 00:37:16.030
be interested in the
brain, they will come up.

00:37:16.030 --> 00:37:18.530
And if you're a
neuroscientist, you

00:37:18.530 --> 00:37:20.195
have to invite them
to your wedding.

00:37:20.195 --> 00:37:21.479
You have to do everything.

00:37:21.479 --> 00:37:23.770
I don't even know if they're--
they might even be dead.

00:37:23.770 --> 00:37:27.410
You have to seance
them, or something.

00:37:27.410 --> 00:37:31.300
But what they decided to do
was then, OK, now we're at V1.

00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:34.040
We're at the one level
of visual cortex.

00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:35.880
What else can we do?

00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:38.430
Where does the scene get
constructed that we see?

00:37:38.430 --> 00:37:41.454
And what they did was
looked one layer up.

00:37:41.454 --> 00:37:42.870
And they did the
exact same thing.

00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:45.370
They fired individual
retinal neurons.

00:37:45.370 --> 00:37:49.270
And they looked in
the next layer up.

00:37:49.270 --> 00:37:50.720
And absolutely nothing happened.

00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:53.150
There was no activity anywhere,
no matter what they did.

00:37:53.150 --> 00:37:55.460
It fired all of them, and
there was no activity.

00:37:55.460 --> 00:37:57.580
And they were like, oh, damn it.

00:37:57.580 --> 00:38:00.470
We're not going to get
invited to any weddings.

00:38:00.470 --> 00:38:01.770
What are we going to do?

00:38:01.770 --> 00:38:06.200
But what they discovered
was that if you activated

00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:08.300
enough retinal
neurons, and that they

00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:12.170
were in a certain spatial
orientation, say a line,

00:38:12.170 --> 00:38:15.000
then you get activation
in this other layer

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:16.680
of your visual cortex.

00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:19.580
And what they discovered,
and what was on, I'm sure,

00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:22.360
the construction of all of
their wedding invitations,

00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:26.660
was that if you have
certain neurons that

00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:31.120
are selective to certain
orientations of lines, like so,

00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:33.340
if you imagine these
are four neurons,

00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:36.770
a single neuron will be
responsive to a vertical line.

00:38:36.770 --> 00:38:39.190
A single neuron, another
one, a different one,

00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:42.550
will be responsive
to a 45-degree angle,

00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:45.020
a horizontal line, 135 degrees.

00:38:45.020 --> 00:38:50.250
And so what you get, and you're
starting to piece together,

00:38:50.250 --> 00:38:53.880
is this way of constructing the
visual world that is layered,

00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:58.480
and that extracts out features,
and that through those features

00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:01.690
you get individual
neural activation.

00:39:01.690 --> 00:39:05.220
And you might imagine that
if you go up even further,

00:39:05.220 --> 00:39:08.040
you would get some sort
of more higher order

00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:10.660
types of activation,
individual activation,

00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:14.000
in your visual cortex, something
like, say, a neuron that only

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.820
responds to an orange, or
a neuron that only responds

00:39:16.820 --> 00:39:18.640
to a banana, or a
neuron that-- so this

00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:20.510
is one of the terms
in the field--

00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:22.277
only responds to
your grandmother.

00:39:22.277 --> 00:39:23.860
And they call it a
grandmother neuron.

00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:25.484
And there's this kind
of El Dorado type

00:39:25.484 --> 00:39:27.830
quest for grandmother neuron.

00:39:27.830 --> 00:39:29.430
Where can we find it?

00:39:29.430 --> 00:39:31.655
And the problem is,
nobody ever found it.

00:39:34.730 --> 00:39:37.150
So then the question
becomes, again,

00:39:37.150 --> 00:39:39.380
related to memory, related
to even our understanding

00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:42.750
of these kind of
networks of neurons.

00:39:42.750 --> 00:39:45.565
Where are these memories stored?

00:39:52.850 --> 00:39:54.100
This is slightly out of order.

00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:57.930
But basically, this is
an example of, again,

00:39:57.930 --> 00:39:59.660
your lateral inhibition.

00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:03.289
So to understand how it is that
these signals are sharpened,

00:40:03.289 --> 00:40:04.580
this is a nice visual illusion.

00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:09.120
Do you guys see little dots
of dark between each of those?

00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:10.070
That is an artifact.

00:40:10.070 --> 00:40:11.986
That is an artifact of
your visual perception.

00:40:11.986 --> 00:40:15.900
That is an artifact of
you constructing that.

00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:16.997
And why is that happening?

00:40:16.997 --> 00:40:18.830
Because at each of those
individual corners,

00:40:18.830 --> 00:40:20.630
you're getting the
most amount, because

00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:25.440
of the four axial bars of
white, of lateral inhibition.

00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:27.580
So in every single one
of your brains right now,

00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:29.954
whenever you look at
the individual corner,

00:40:29.954 --> 00:40:31.370
you're getting
lateral inhibition.

00:40:31.370 --> 00:40:34.860
And so you can imagine
that this type of thing

00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:37.520
is a demonstration of
lateral inhibition.

00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:41.546
Another type of thing, when
I was talking about pain,

00:40:41.546 --> 00:40:43.420
there's this fascinating
thing where-- we all

00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:45.350
know this-- where if
something itches, say,

00:40:45.350 --> 00:40:46.730
you have a mosquito bite.

00:40:46.730 --> 00:40:49.290
And you want to scratch
the hell out of it,

00:40:49.290 --> 00:40:50.970
because sometimes it
feels really good.

00:40:50.970 --> 00:40:54.230
You notice also that you
can scratch around it.

00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:57.940
You can make hard,
kind of painful stimuli

00:40:57.940 --> 00:40:59.890
in the immediate
vicinity, and just

00:40:59.890 --> 00:41:01.590
do it really,
really hard enough.

00:41:01.590 --> 00:41:03.337
And you get lessening of pain.

00:41:03.337 --> 00:41:05.170
And what that is, is
the same type of thing.

00:41:05.170 --> 00:41:08.650
It's lateral inhibition of the
focal point of the mosquito

00:41:08.650 --> 00:41:09.490
bite.

00:41:09.490 --> 00:41:11.296
And so these things
sound abstract,

00:41:11.296 --> 00:41:12.670
but these things
really are real.

00:41:12.670 --> 00:41:16.770
And we can see them,
and we can feel them,

00:41:16.770 --> 00:41:18.760
if we know where to look.

00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:21.910
So one last idea.

00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:23.780
We're trying to
get at, OK, where

00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:24.950
are these memories stored?

00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:25.890
Where are these facts?

00:41:25.890 --> 00:41:29.870
Where is what you know now
about neurobiology stored?

00:41:29.870 --> 00:41:37.310
And it's helpful to introduce
the idea of neural networks.

00:41:37.310 --> 00:41:39.890
There's 100 billion
neurons in the brain.

00:41:39.890 --> 00:41:42.440
These are not
communicating one to one.

00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:45.210
These are communicating
with tens of thousands

00:41:45.210 --> 00:41:47.060
of other types of neurons.

00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:49.780
And if you simplify this
down to just the basic idea

00:41:49.780 --> 00:41:52.800
of a neural network,
such that you

00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:56.220
have your bottom,
first layer cells.

00:41:56.220 --> 00:41:59.960
And these first layer cells
respond to, respectively, left

00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:03.540
to right, Monet, Cezanne, Degas.

00:42:03.540 --> 00:42:04.290
They just respond.

00:42:04.290 --> 00:42:06.050
For some reason,
they have been tuned.

00:42:06.050 --> 00:42:08.870
They have undergone LTP.

00:42:08.870 --> 00:42:11.800
That is what they respond to
in this very one-to-one Hubel

00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:14.650
and Wiesel kind of way.

00:42:14.650 --> 00:42:17.780
But what we notice is that
there's this elaborate property

00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:20.750
you get when you start
to combine neurons

00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:23.010
with many, many other
types of neurons, which

00:42:23.010 --> 00:42:24.340
is that you get a network.

00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:27.060
And you get a network without
one-to-one correspondence.

00:42:27.060 --> 00:42:29.710
So if you look at the top
row, and you get neurons A

00:42:29.710 --> 00:42:34.130
through E, A still responds
in this one-to-one way,

00:42:34.130 --> 00:42:35.850
with just Monet.

00:42:35.850 --> 00:42:39.150
E, again, you got just Degas.

00:42:39.150 --> 00:42:41.210
So those are not really
informative in the way

00:42:41.210 --> 00:42:43.940
in which we want to understand
the emergent property,

00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:46.654
and what's important
about neural networks.

00:42:46.654 --> 00:42:48.070
What we get out
of neural networks

00:42:48.070 --> 00:42:52.220
is emphasized when
we focus on C. Neuron

00:42:52.220 --> 00:42:57.080
C doesn't know-- if it gets
activated, what can you tell?

00:42:57.080 --> 00:43:00.880
You don't know which
input it came from.

00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:03.470
You don't know whether it came
from the first-layer neuron

00:43:03.470 --> 00:43:05.230
1, first-layer neuron 2, or 3.

00:43:05.230 --> 00:43:09.140
You don't know whether or not it
was a Monet, Cezanne, or Degas.

00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:11.810
All you know is that
it's one of those three.

00:43:11.810 --> 00:43:14.360
And what you get
now is this idea

00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:17.870
that you can have concepts,
and you can have categories.

00:43:17.870 --> 00:43:20.866
And you can have a
category of impressionism.

00:43:20.866 --> 00:43:22.240
That doesn't
necessarily give you

00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:26.010
information about individual
types or names, or which

00:43:26.010 --> 00:43:27.160
neuron it came from.

00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:29.430
But you have a
network of neurons

00:43:29.430 --> 00:43:31.160
with different concepts in it.

00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:35.340
And amidst this
network, you can now

00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:39.590
understand how it is that
environment and context can

00:43:39.590 --> 00:43:43.330
impinge on the storage
and retrieval of facts.

00:43:43.330 --> 00:43:51.580
So the idea that emotionally
salient memories are longer

00:43:51.580 --> 00:43:55.330
lived in your brain, in your
synapses, in your plasticity,

00:43:55.330 --> 00:43:57.650
than other ones,
well, how is that true

00:43:57.650 --> 00:44:00.040
if they're not contextually
related, if the mechanism is

00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:01.290
the same everywhere?

00:44:01.290 --> 00:44:05.340
But what you begin to see is
that if you combine context

00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:08.150
in this version of
neural networks,

00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:12.190
you start to get the neural
representation of context,

00:44:12.190 --> 00:44:14.170
the neural representation
of environment.

00:44:14.170 --> 00:44:16.220
And this makes sense
if you think about how

00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:17.665
we try to remember things.

00:44:17.665 --> 00:44:19.040
If you try to
remember something,

00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:20.831
and you know it's an
impressionist painter,

00:44:20.831 --> 00:44:22.570
or you know it's
within a category,

00:44:22.570 --> 00:44:24.930
but you're not quite
there, you kind of

00:44:24.930 --> 00:44:29.100
take a tour of categorical
ways of thinking

00:44:29.100 --> 00:44:31.470
and categorical learning
and categorical objects

00:44:31.470 --> 00:44:34.810
in the world to try to
get at how that one fact,

00:44:34.810 --> 00:44:37.630
that one bit of information
that you're trying to remember.

00:44:37.630 --> 00:44:43.450
So it's not that individual
memories are stored in neurons.

00:44:43.450 --> 00:44:46.260
It's not that they're stored
in the generation of synapses.

00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:51.520
It's not that they are stored
in entirely just the plasticity

00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:53.650
of single synapses.

00:44:53.650 --> 00:44:56.940
It seems that we can
get at and explain

00:44:56.940 --> 00:45:00.160
a lot of these types of
memory by understanding

00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:03.826
that memory is one
aspect of the formation

00:45:03.826 --> 00:45:05.700
of these neural networks,
and that if we have

00:45:05.700 --> 00:45:07.680
100 billion neurons,
we can imagine

00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:13.010
elaborate and complex ways
of designing these things.

00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:14.750
So here we go, one more time.

00:45:14.750 --> 00:45:16.310
Many very different
things happen

00:45:16.310 --> 00:45:18.680
when we remember,
everything down

00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:22.750
from the synaptic
plasticity all the way up

00:45:22.750 --> 00:45:25.940
to this impressionism,
categorical way of thinking

00:45:25.940 --> 00:45:28.180
and remembering about things.

00:45:28.180 --> 00:45:33.360
And what is again
interesting here

00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:35.860
is that you can
imagine-- what we've

00:45:35.860 --> 00:45:40.580
learned about polymorphisms,
genetic individuality

00:45:40.580 --> 00:45:42.590
and variation, that
certain people can have

00:45:42.590 --> 00:45:44.450
different stress responses.

00:45:44.450 --> 00:45:46.780
The person next to you can
have a different response

00:45:46.780 --> 00:45:47.880
to stress than the other person.

00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:49.980
One person will be more
afraid of public speaking

00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:50.896
than the other person.

00:45:50.896 --> 00:45:52.580
One person will
respond a certain way

00:45:52.580 --> 00:45:54.522
based on prenatal,
postnatal environment,

00:45:54.522 --> 00:45:56.980
all these different things,
all these different variations,

00:45:56.980 --> 00:46:01.330
these polymorphisms that lead to
individual and varied behavior.

00:46:01.330 --> 00:46:07.800
And now we can understand that
a polymorphism in how much

00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:10.140
presynaptic glutamate
gets released-- remember,

00:46:10.140 --> 00:46:12.900
glutamate, excitatory--
a polymorphism

00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:16.950
in how strongly your
postsynaptic receptor responds,

00:46:16.950 --> 00:46:20.690
a polymorphism in the ways in
which your neural networks are

00:46:20.690 --> 00:46:23.200
constructed, these types
of individual things,

00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:29.030
which each are their own
variable in your brain's

00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:33.680
construct of memory, can lead
to different and individual ways

00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:34.800
in which we remember.

00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:37.350
Some people are just better
at remembering than others.

00:46:37.350 --> 00:46:42.215
And what we're trying to get
at is from the spectrum of HM,

00:46:42.215 --> 00:46:44.790
who can't remember anything,
to Stephen Wiltshire, who

00:46:44.790 --> 00:46:49.870
can remember this, and where
the genetics and the environment

00:46:49.870 --> 00:46:53.820
impact our individual memory.

00:46:53.820 --> 00:46:55.594
And I think that's it.

00:46:55.594 --> 00:46:57.010
So we'll take a
five minute break.

00:46:57.010 --> 00:46:58.910
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:58.910 --> 00:47:01.590
I'm going to talk to you guys
about the autonomic nervous

00:47:01.590 --> 00:47:02.900
system.

00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:05.440
So basically, autonomic
sounds like automatic.

00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:07.870
This is anything that's
going to happen automatically

00:47:07.870 --> 00:47:11.320
in your body, not quite
the hippocampus, horse,

00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:15.360
like hippodrome-- like
automatic, autonomic.

00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:19.952
So basically, your heart
beating, digesting,

00:47:19.952 --> 00:47:24.241
goosebumps, orgasm, things that
you don't have control over--

00:47:24.241 --> 00:47:24.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:24.740 --> 00:47:26.370
Good stuff, right?

00:47:26.370 --> 00:47:29.940
This is going to be your
autonomic nervous system.

00:47:29.940 --> 00:47:33.020
So first, the nervous
system, remember,

00:47:33.020 --> 00:47:35.830
is split up into the
central and the peripheral.

00:47:35.830 --> 00:47:39.670
So our central nervous system is
our brain and our spinal cord.

00:47:39.670 --> 00:47:41.160
And our peripheral
nervous system

00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:44.310
is everything else
on the periphery.

00:47:44.310 --> 00:47:46.720
And then within that, the
peripheral nervous system

00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:49.590
can be split up into the
somatic nervous system

00:47:49.590 --> 00:47:50.634
and the autonomic.

00:47:50.634 --> 00:47:52.050
So we're going
over the autonomic.

00:47:52.050 --> 00:47:52.785
Remember that.

00:47:52.785 --> 00:47:54.410
But just to tell you
about the somatic,

00:47:54.410 --> 00:47:56.950
that's basically the
voluntary nervous system.

00:47:56.950 --> 00:48:00.360
So if you want to pick
up a pen off the ground,

00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:02.650
your brain says, OK, I
want to pick up a pen.

00:48:02.650 --> 00:48:04.960
Send the message to my muscle.

00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:06.660
Muscle's going to
pick up the pan.

00:48:06.660 --> 00:48:09.910
It's also your
sensory info, so when

00:48:09.910 --> 00:48:13.140
you touch something or
smell something, information

00:48:13.140 --> 00:48:17.010
from the periphery going to
your central nervous system.

00:48:17.010 --> 00:48:18.800
And autonomic
nervous system, what

00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:20.570
we're going to talk
about today, can

00:48:20.570 --> 00:48:23.520
be split up into the
parasympathetic and sympathetic

00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:24.540
nervous systems.

00:48:24.540 --> 00:48:26.340
We'll go over all
those in detail.

00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:29.350
But for right now,
one last comparison

00:48:29.350 --> 00:48:32.100
of the voluntary and autonomic.

00:48:32.100 --> 00:48:36.150
So the voluntary nervous
system, remember, voluntary,

00:48:36.150 --> 00:48:38.050
moves muscles.

00:48:38.050 --> 00:48:41.790
Autonomic, it's involuntary,
moving organs, your heart,

00:48:41.790 --> 00:48:45.040
your digestive
system, your lungs.

00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:48.060
The voluntary nervous
system's actually myelinated.

00:48:48.060 --> 00:48:50.860
So what that means is there's
a myelin sheath covering

00:48:50.860 --> 00:48:53.310
the axon, as you can see there.

00:48:53.310 --> 00:48:54.830
And the action
potential actually

00:48:54.830 --> 00:48:58.140
can speed up and go
down the axon faster.

00:48:58.140 --> 00:49:01.160
And the autonomic nervous
system's actually unmyelinated.

00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:02.399
These are just fun facts.

00:49:02.399 --> 00:49:03.690
So it goes a little bit slower.

00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:08.660
The good stuff, autonomic
nervous system--

00:49:08.660 --> 00:49:11.640
so we have sympathetic
and parasympathetic.

00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:14.240
And sympathetic is
that nervous system

00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:15.650
where you hear fight or flight.

00:49:15.650 --> 00:49:19.560
So anything exciting,
arousal, alertness, emergency,

00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:21.720
like if you have a
hippo chasing after you

00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:25.210
or something, definitely
sympathetic nervous system.

00:49:25.210 --> 00:49:28.590
If you like somebody and are
talking to them first time,

00:49:28.590 --> 00:49:31.380
sympathetic nervous system
activation, you're excited.

00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:35.280
Parasympathetic is more of
the calm, vegetative function.

00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:39.790
So after you have a huge meal,
or when you want to take a nap,

00:49:39.790 --> 00:49:44.730
anything like that, growth,
repair, total relaxation state.

00:49:44.730 --> 00:49:46.750
And as you can see,
they kind of sound

00:49:46.750 --> 00:49:49.600
like they have opposing
functions, because they do.

00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:51.420
And they tend to
work in opposition,

00:49:51.420 --> 00:49:54.179
so it's kind of like
putting your foot on the gas

00:49:54.179 --> 00:49:55.470
and the brake at the same time.

00:49:55.470 --> 00:49:57.970
You can't really do that,
because they're opposing.

00:49:57.970 --> 00:50:00.630
When the parasympathetic
system is on,

00:50:00.630 --> 00:50:04.180
your sympathetic nervous system
is usually off, and vice versa.

00:50:04.180 --> 00:50:08.604
So they work together to keep
our body going automatically.

00:50:08.604 --> 00:50:11.470
OK, sympathetic nervous
system-- so remember,

00:50:11.470 --> 00:50:15.020
this is like that huge animal,
whatever your favorite one is,

00:50:15.020 --> 00:50:16.310
chasing after you.

00:50:16.310 --> 00:50:17.740
What do you do?

00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:19.790
Well, your heart speeds up.

00:50:19.790 --> 00:50:21.530
It's going to beat faster.

00:50:21.530 --> 00:50:22.900
You're going to breathe more.

00:50:22.900 --> 00:50:24.850
You're going to vasoconstrict.

00:50:24.850 --> 00:50:27.390
So what that means is you're
sending the blood-- you're

00:50:27.390 --> 00:50:29.236
basically constricting
your blood vessels

00:50:29.236 --> 00:50:31.610
and sending blood more to your
lungs and to your muscles,

00:50:31.610 --> 00:50:32.752
so you can run away.

00:50:32.752 --> 00:50:35.360
You're going to
inhibit digestion.

00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:37.150
When you're running
away from a hippo,

00:50:37.150 --> 00:50:40.880
you don't care about digesting
the sandwich you just had.

00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:42.240
You're going to sweat.

00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:44.097
Your muscles will
tense, anything

00:50:44.097 --> 00:50:46.430
you would think of when you're
just totally freaked out.

00:50:49.140 --> 00:50:52.560
And the parasympathetic
nervous system-- I

00:50:52.560 --> 00:50:55.140
really like these pictures.

00:50:55.140 --> 00:50:57.570
I found the dog, and
I got super excited.

00:50:57.570 --> 00:51:00.070
And then I found him,
and I wanted to name him,

00:51:00.070 --> 00:51:01.980
but I haven't thought of it yet.

00:51:01.980 --> 00:51:05.580
But basically, they're
resting and digesting.

00:51:05.580 --> 00:51:09.045
They're just taking it
easy, like growth, repair.

00:51:09.045 --> 00:51:11.420
Basically anything you would
do when you're not stressed,

00:51:11.420 --> 00:51:13.000
you have time to do now.

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:14.610
Your immune system
can function well.

00:51:14.610 --> 00:51:17.310
You can spend time
digesting and urinating.

00:51:20.310 --> 00:51:22.290
Sympathetic nervous
system-- So we're

00:51:22.290 --> 00:51:24.910
going to look into the
neurotransmitters involved

00:51:24.910 --> 00:51:26.140
in both the symptoms now.

00:51:26.140 --> 00:51:30.030
So neurons-- what's
being communicated?

00:51:30.030 --> 00:51:33.340
And I know that Pat told
you glutamate's the best.

00:51:33.340 --> 00:51:37.340
But I'm going to fight that and
tell you that norepinephrine

00:51:37.340 --> 00:51:38.790
is one of the good ones, too.

00:51:38.790 --> 00:51:42.140
So basically, you
release norepinephrine

00:51:42.140 --> 00:51:43.920
in the target organs
when you're dealing

00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:45.900
with the sympathetic
nervous system.

00:51:45.900 --> 00:51:47.884
So the hippo coming
at you, what you do

00:51:47.884 --> 00:51:49.634
is you're going to
release norepinephrine,

00:51:49.634 --> 00:51:51.600
NE, onto the target organs.

00:51:51.600 --> 00:51:54.620
And you can see the
organs on the right.

00:51:54.620 --> 00:51:56.274
It affects all of those.

00:51:56.274 --> 00:51:57.440
So it's going to your heart.

00:51:57.440 --> 00:51:59.280
It's going to your lungs.

00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:01.260
It's going to your
kidney, your bladder.

00:52:01.260 --> 00:52:04.110
And it's telling it-- when
it receives norepinephrine,

00:52:04.110 --> 00:52:06.720
those organs know, OK, my
sympathetic nervous system

00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:07.860
is activated.

00:52:07.860 --> 00:52:09.150
I'm going to fight or flight.

00:52:09.150 --> 00:52:10.483
I'm going to run away right now.

00:52:10.483 --> 00:52:13.370
Or I'm going to start-- my
heart's going to beat faster.

00:52:13.370 --> 00:52:17.700
And the one exception is the
sympathetic nervous system

00:52:17.700 --> 00:52:21.190
actually releases
epinephrine in the adrenal.

00:52:21.190 --> 00:52:23.630
And this is just
a cool exception.

00:52:23.630 --> 00:52:27.920
Epinephrine, remember it's one
step away from norepinephrine

00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:29.220
in the biosynthetic pathway.

00:52:29.220 --> 00:52:31.220
So you can make epinephrine
from norepinephrine,

00:52:31.220 --> 00:52:33.770
so they're not really
that different.

00:52:33.770 --> 00:52:38.320
And epinephrine's also
called adrenaline-- adrenal,

00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:42.450
adrenaline, see the resemblance.

00:52:42.450 --> 00:52:45.630
And this is just
another diagram, again,

00:52:45.630 --> 00:52:48.330
showing you norepinephrine
released on the target organ.

00:52:48.330 --> 00:52:50.929
So you think of sympathetic,
you think of norepinephrine.

00:52:50.929 --> 00:52:53.220
And you can see how it will
go and accelerate the heart

00:52:53.220 --> 00:52:55.330
beat, stuff like that.

00:52:55.330 --> 00:52:57.140
And just more in
detail, if you've

00:52:57.140 --> 00:52:59.596
taken bio core-- I don't know
about [INAUDIBLE] bio core,

00:52:59.596 --> 00:53:02.562
but definitely bio core-- you
know that it's not that simple.

00:53:02.562 --> 00:53:04.020
You don't need to
worry about this.

00:53:04.020 --> 00:53:06.530
But there's actually
an intermediate step,

00:53:06.530 --> 00:53:09.390
where the spinal cord
projections actually

00:53:09.390 --> 00:53:13.520
first go to this ganglion, which
then goes to the target organ

00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:15.100
and releases NE there.

00:53:15.100 --> 00:53:16.260
But don't worry about that.

00:53:16.260 --> 00:53:20.260
Just know norepinephrine,
sympathetic.

00:53:20.260 --> 00:53:22.430
Parasympathetic
nervous system-- so we

00:53:22.430 --> 00:53:24.010
have another cool
neurotransmitter

00:53:24.010 --> 00:53:30.190
besides glutamate and NE,
which is acetylcholine, or ACh.

00:53:30.190 --> 00:53:33.990
And the parasympathetic, you see
it goes to all the same organs.

00:53:33.990 --> 00:53:36.880
But now, when it releases
ACh, those organs

00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:40.370
know parasympathetic,
rest and digest.

00:53:40.370 --> 00:53:44.400
I have time to finish my
meal and do everything that I

00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:47.240
can do when I want to relax.

00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:49.650
And again, there is
an intermediate step,

00:53:49.650 --> 00:53:52.860
where you release acetylcholine
first in the target organ.

00:53:52.860 --> 00:53:56.190
And then a second neuron goes,
releases acetylcholine again.

00:53:56.190 --> 00:54:00.300
This [INAUDIBLE]
Ach, parasympathetic.

00:54:00.300 --> 00:54:02.200
And if you want more
details about it,

00:54:02.200 --> 00:54:05.400
too, this slide is
totally extra details.

00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:08.990
But you can see the projections
from the spinal cord

00:54:08.990 --> 00:54:10.540
actually lead from
different places

00:54:10.540 --> 00:54:13.380
in the parasympathetic and the
sympathetic nervous system.

00:54:13.380 --> 00:54:15.700
And you can just see at
the end, acetylcholine

00:54:15.700 --> 00:54:19.640
and norepinephrine
being released.

00:54:19.640 --> 00:54:21.170
So this is a really
important slide.

00:54:21.170 --> 00:54:22.746
That's why I put stars on it.

00:54:22.746 --> 00:54:24.472
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:24.472 --> 00:54:26.180
Even Sapolsky, when
he saw my PowerPoint,

00:54:26.180 --> 00:54:28.138
he was like, spend a lot
of time on that slide.

00:54:28.138 --> 00:54:29.940
So I'm going to.

00:54:29.940 --> 00:54:33.250
So we're going to look at
exactly what happens when

00:54:33.250 --> 00:54:35.600
your parasympathetic or
sympathetic nervous systems

00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:38.810
are activated, and compare
them in different organs.

00:54:38.810 --> 00:54:41.920
So the easiest one to start with
is your cardiovascular system,

00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:43.100
so your heart.

00:54:43.100 --> 00:54:44.930
You're running
away, you're scared,

00:54:44.930 --> 00:54:46.930
or you're meeting someone
new for the first time

00:54:46.930 --> 00:54:48.430
that you really like.

00:54:48.430 --> 00:54:50.800
And your sympathetic
nervous system turns on.

00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:52.560
Your heart's going
to beat faster.

00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:53.600
Remember that.

00:54:53.600 --> 00:54:56.540
So your heart actually
has a myogenic rhythm,

00:54:56.540 --> 00:54:58.990
which means it actually
has a muscle that

00:54:58.990 --> 00:55:00.514
is controlling its beating.

00:55:00.514 --> 00:55:03.180
But what the brain does, and the
sympathetic and parasympathetic

00:55:03.180 --> 00:55:05.180
nervous system does,
is it can change

00:55:05.180 --> 00:55:07.110
how fast the heart beats.

00:55:07.110 --> 00:55:08.610
So your heart's beating faster.

00:55:08.610 --> 00:55:10.100
Your blood pressure
will increase

00:55:10.100 --> 00:55:12.206
when your sympathetic
nervous system is on.

00:55:12.206 --> 00:55:14.080
You're going to
vasoconstrict, remember, send

00:55:14.080 --> 00:55:16.910
the blood to your muscles,
so you can run away and all

00:55:16.910 --> 00:55:17.960
that good stuff.

00:55:17.960 --> 00:55:20.850
And parasympathetic-- opposite.

00:55:20.850 --> 00:55:25.120
Slower heart beat,
vasodilation of the vessels.

00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:28.255
Blood's now going to the
GI tract for digestion,

00:55:28.255 --> 00:55:31.690
and everything like that.

00:55:31.690 --> 00:55:34.330
Another fun example is
the GI tract itself,

00:55:34.330 --> 00:55:37.320
so your gut, your stomach,
your small intestine.

00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:41.460
So basically, parasympathetic
activity, when you're resting,

00:55:41.460 --> 00:55:42.960
you have time to digest.

00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:46.660
So what you do is you
stimulate the secretion

00:55:46.660 --> 00:55:49.180
of the acids and enzymes
needed for digestion.

00:55:49.180 --> 00:55:53.080
You move your small
intestine with a contraction

00:55:53.080 --> 00:55:55.390
called peristalsis.

00:55:55.390 --> 00:55:58.864
And basically, you can go to
the bathroom, and everything

00:55:58.864 --> 00:56:00.530
that you would do
while you're relaxing.

00:56:03.750 --> 00:56:06.520
Sorry.

00:56:06.520 --> 00:56:08.792
So in the heart
and the GI tract,

00:56:08.792 --> 00:56:11.250
you can pretty much see that
they're working in opposition.

00:56:11.250 --> 00:56:13.460
So when the heart beats
up with sympathetic,

00:56:13.460 --> 00:56:15.340
it slows down with
parasympathetic.

00:56:15.340 --> 00:56:18.180
GI, the opposite case,
parasympathetic turns it on,

00:56:18.180 --> 00:56:19.610
speeds up digestion.

00:56:19.610 --> 00:56:21.430
Parasympathetic turns it off.

00:56:21.430 --> 00:56:22.215
I'm sorry.

00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:29.090
This is the important slide.

00:56:29.090 --> 00:56:35.210
So one place where they
actually do work together

00:56:35.210 --> 00:56:38.070
instead of actually
opposing each other

00:56:38.070 --> 00:56:40.230
is in the male
reproductive system.

00:56:40.230 --> 00:56:43.320
And they work together for
you to erect and ejaculate.

00:56:43.320 --> 00:56:47.100
So what happens is in
order to have an erection,

00:56:47.100 --> 00:56:49.000
you have to be stress free.

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:50.860
You can't be worrying
about your test.

00:56:50.860 --> 00:56:54.190
So which one do you think
is in charge of erection,

00:56:54.190 --> 00:56:55.840
parasympathetic or sympathetic?

00:56:55.840 --> 00:56:56.520
Parasympathetic.

00:56:56.520 --> 00:56:57.020
Perfect.

00:56:57.020 --> 00:57:01.120
So parasympathetic activation,
you get an erection.

00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:03.820
Now let's say you
have an erection.

00:57:03.820 --> 00:57:05.929
And now you're with
somebody, maybe.

00:57:05.929 --> 00:57:07.220
I don't know what you're doing.

00:57:07.220 --> 00:57:08.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:08.740 --> 00:57:12.074
Whatever's happening-- sorry.

00:57:15.164 --> 00:57:17.330
All of a sudden, you feel
your heart beating faster.

00:57:17.330 --> 00:57:19.610
You start sweating a little bit.

00:57:19.610 --> 00:57:22.502
Your sympathetic nervous system
is turned on a little bit now.

00:57:22.502 --> 00:57:24.960
So now we have parasympathetic,
we still have our erection.

00:57:24.960 --> 00:57:27.557
But we also have some
sympathetic activity,

00:57:27.557 --> 00:57:29.390
and then more and more
sympathetic activity.

00:57:29.390 --> 00:57:32.370
And all of a sudden, sympathetic
activity completely takes over.

00:57:32.370 --> 00:57:33.456
And what happens?

00:57:33.456 --> 00:57:35.180
You ejaculate, right?

00:57:35.180 --> 00:57:39.820
So parasympathetic-- erection,
sympathetic-- ejaculation.

00:57:39.820 --> 00:57:43.990
And it's actually a cool fact
about erectile dysfunction

00:57:43.990 --> 00:57:48.270
that about 60% of the cases are
due to stress and not actually

00:57:48.270 --> 00:57:50.640
organic basis in your body.

00:57:50.640 --> 00:57:52.750
So if you're stressed
out all of the time,

00:57:52.750 --> 00:57:56.180
your parasympathetic
activity won't turn on,

00:57:56.180 --> 00:57:58.670
so you can't have an erection.

00:57:58.670 --> 00:58:01.210
And also, we can explain
premature ejaculation,

00:58:01.210 --> 00:58:03.810
if you want to to
your friends tonight.

00:58:03.810 --> 00:58:05.882
You can just be like,
well, let's think about it.

00:58:05.882 --> 00:58:08.340
So I have an erection, but I'm
going to ejaculate too soon.

00:58:08.340 --> 00:58:11.940
So parasympathetic transition
to sympathetic transition,

00:58:11.940 --> 00:58:14.320
or the parasympathetic
transition to sympathetic,

00:58:14.320 --> 00:58:19.322
happens too quickly, your
premature ejaculation.

00:58:19.322 --> 00:58:20.790
[LAUGHTER]

00:58:20.790 --> 00:58:23.880
And then health,
so immune system.

00:58:23.880 --> 00:58:26.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:58:26.230 --> 00:58:29.220
When your parasympathetic
system is on,

00:58:29.220 --> 00:58:31.760
you can take care of
your immune system.

00:58:31.760 --> 00:58:33.760
You have the time to make
the white blood cells.

00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:37.515
But when you're chasing away
from a predator or an elephant,

00:58:37.515 --> 00:58:39.890
you really don't care about
making new white blood cells.

00:58:39.890 --> 00:58:43.630
And this could also explain
why it's easier to get sick

00:58:43.630 --> 00:58:44.740
when you're stressed out.

00:58:44.740 --> 00:58:46.450
Your sympathetic
is too much caring

00:58:46.450 --> 00:58:48.418
about your stressful
situation than taking

00:58:48.418 --> 00:58:49.542
care of your immune system.

00:58:52.200 --> 00:58:54.990
I don't know-- oh my
computer goes on sleep.

00:58:54.990 --> 00:58:55.987
I think that's it.

00:58:59.740 --> 00:59:02.350
So again, we see there's
a balance between the two

00:59:02.350 --> 00:59:02.910
branches.

00:59:02.910 --> 00:59:06.140
So sympathetic, you're
running away from a snake.

00:59:06.140 --> 00:59:07.600
When that's on,
parasympathetic's

00:59:07.600 --> 00:59:09.780
off, and vice versa.

00:59:09.780 --> 00:59:14.300
And there's actually a really
cute video that I found.

00:59:16.870 --> 00:59:18.170
And you have to click it twice.

00:59:24.430 --> 00:59:27.084
So the sympathetic
nervous system, this video

00:59:27.084 --> 00:59:29.000
will tell you everything
that I just told you.

00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:32.130
It increases heart
rate, makes your pupils

00:59:32.130 --> 00:59:35.310
dilate so you can see further,
run away from the predator.

00:59:35.310 --> 00:59:36.840
You don't have time to digest.

00:59:36.840 --> 00:59:39.180
You don't care about nasal
secretions right now.

00:59:39.180 --> 00:59:39.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:59:39.800 --> 00:59:41.400
You're not going
to produce saliva.

00:59:41.400 --> 00:59:44.050
Who cares about eating?

00:59:44.050 --> 00:59:47.550
Inhibits the liver,
kidneys, and gall bladder,

00:59:47.550 --> 00:59:48.910
and stimulates sweating.

00:59:48.910 --> 00:59:51.800
We're going to sweat when we're
running away, getting scared.

00:59:51.800 --> 00:59:53.840
Causes piloerection,
so when your hair

00:59:53.840 --> 00:59:55.820
stands when you're nervous.

00:59:55.820 --> 00:59:59.830
Makes the lungs dilate,
you can breathe faster.

00:59:59.830 --> 01:00:03.910
Increases muscle strength
so you can run away,

01:00:03.910 --> 01:00:05.430
and is important for orgasm.

01:00:05.430 --> 01:00:08.430
[LAUGHTER]

01:00:08.430 --> 01:00:10.820
Sorry.

01:00:10.820 --> 01:00:14.780
Parasympathetic, opposite, so it
makes your heart rate go down.

01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:16.032
Pupils are going to contract.

01:00:16.032 --> 01:00:16.990
You're going to digest.

01:00:19.690 --> 01:00:22.218
You're going to like the
nasal secretions now.

01:00:22.218 --> 01:00:23.859
[LAUGHTER]

01:00:23.859 --> 01:00:25.900
You're going to stimulate
the liver, the bladder,

01:00:25.900 --> 01:00:28.270
and the kidneys.

01:00:28.270 --> 01:00:30.172
You constrict your lungs.

01:00:30.172 --> 01:00:32.380
You're going to pay more
attention to your digestion.

01:00:32.380 --> 01:00:36.900
And it's important for sexual
arousal, remember erections.

01:00:36.900 --> 01:00:38.170
You can play it again later.

01:00:44.380 --> 01:00:46.250
So an important
point to make is when

01:00:46.250 --> 01:00:48.630
we think about sympathetic
nervous system,

01:00:48.630 --> 01:00:51.870
we're thinking about arousal,
emergency, fight or flight.

01:00:51.870 --> 01:00:54.130
But that doesn't mean it
always goes to the organ

01:00:54.130 --> 01:00:55.500
and excites it.

01:00:55.500 --> 01:00:58.121
So in the heart,
when norepinephrine

01:00:58.121 --> 01:01:00.370
goes from the sympathetic
nervous system to the heart,

01:01:00.370 --> 01:01:03.220
it does excite the heart
and make it beat faster.

01:01:03.220 --> 01:01:05.040
But when it goes
to the GI tract,

01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:07.334
it inhibits GI tract activity.

01:01:07.334 --> 01:01:09.750
So it's not always excitatory,
it's not always inhibitory.

01:01:09.750 --> 01:01:11.400
It depends on the organ.

01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:12.980
Same with parasympathetic.

01:01:12.980 --> 01:01:15.660
We think of it as being
the slower moving one.

01:01:15.660 --> 01:01:18.540
But in the GI tract,
it does excite it.

01:01:18.540 --> 01:01:20.270
In the heart, it inhibits.

01:01:20.270 --> 01:01:21.500
So what does that mean?

01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:26.190
It means we need two different
receptors on our organs

01:01:26.190 --> 01:01:29.700
that respond to norepinephrine
or acetylcholine.

01:01:29.700 --> 01:01:32.980
So on the heart, for instance,
for norepinephrine, you'll

01:01:32.980 --> 01:01:36.150
have an excitatory
norepinephrine receptor,

01:01:36.150 --> 01:01:38.650
because it will get excited
and make the heart beat faster.

01:01:38.650 --> 01:01:42.400
But in the GI tract, you'll have
an inhibitory norepinephrine

01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:45.330
receptor that will respond to
the sympathetic nervous system

01:01:45.330 --> 01:01:47.070
and slow it down.

01:01:47.070 --> 01:01:48.840
And then for the
parasympathetic,

01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:52.640
you'd have an excitatory ACh
receptor on your GI tract

01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:54.910
to speed it up, to
digest more food.

01:01:54.910 --> 01:01:57.410
And you'll have an
inhibitory ACh receptor

01:01:57.410 --> 01:01:59.250
on the heart to slow it down.

01:01:59.250 --> 01:02:00.910
So just see you
can't always have

01:02:00.910 --> 01:02:02.970
the same receptor
on the same organ,

01:02:02.970 --> 01:02:05.751
or else it wouldn't
respond right.

01:02:05.751 --> 01:02:07.250
And this is just
showing you, again.

01:02:07.250 --> 01:02:10.810
So the heart there, you have
your inhibitory ACh receptor,

01:02:10.810 --> 01:02:12.350
which tells your
heart to slow down.

01:02:12.350 --> 01:02:15.880
Excitatory norepinephrine,
heart speeds up.

01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:19.290
And in the GI tract, if
ACh is coming your way,

01:02:19.290 --> 01:02:21.210
it will attach to the
excitatory receptor,

01:02:21.210 --> 01:02:22.730
and it'll be like, digest.

01:02:22.730 --> 01:02:25.780
And you have the inhibitory
norepinephrine receptor there,

01:02:25.780 --> 01:02:26.520
too.

01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:29.240
So if sympathetic activity
is being stimulated,

01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:33.770
norepinephrine will land there
and will slow down digestion.

01:02:33.770 --> 01:02:36.770
So if you've taken bio core,
if you want to know more--

01:02:36.770 --> 01:02:39.600
there's actually names for all
of these forms of receptors

01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:43.550
that I put there, just in
case you're extra interested.

01:02:43.550 --> 01:02:47.940
But on the heart, I think
the coolest fact about it

01:02:47.940 --> 01:02:48.800
is the beta blocker.

01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:51.440
So the form of the
receptor on the heart that

01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:53.490
responds to the
sympathetic nervous system

01:02:53.490 --> 01:02:55.940
is actually called
a beta receptor.

01:02:55.940 --> 01:02:59.660
And what beta blockers do,
they block the receptor,

01:02:59.660 --> 01:03:00.830
the beta receptor.

01:03:00.830 --> 01:03:02.670
So this is why beta
blockers are used

01:03:02.670 --> 01:03:06.720
for slowing down heart
rate, reducing hypertension.

01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:08.570
It's basically
blocking the effects

01:03:08.570 --> 01:03:10.460
of the sympathetic
nervous system.

01:03:10.460 --> 01:03:13.090
And Pat actually just
told me, which is great,

01:03:13.090 --> 01:03:17.530
that the one drug that's
banned from the Olympics

01:03:17.530 --> 01:03:20.320
are actually beta blockers,
because if you think about it,

01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:23.102
a huge advantage would
be to be less stressed.

01:03:23.102 --> 01:03:24.560
So if they're
blocking the receptor

01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:26.970
on your heart that
responds to stress

01:03:26.970 --> 01:03:28.820
and the sympathetic
nervous system,

01:03:28.820 --> 01:03:30.940
you can see how it could
allow you to relax more.

01:03:30.940 --> 01:03:32.650
So it's a fun fact.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.460
So now we're going to
talk about the regulation

01:03:39.460 --> 01:03:41.540
of the autonomic nervous
system, so what's

01:03:41.540 --> 01:03:44.940
happening in the brain that's
resulting in norepinephrine

01:03:44.940 --> 01:03:47.290
or acetylcholine being released.

01:03:47.290 --> 01:03:50.720
And the center of regulation
is now the hypothalamus.

01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:53.230
So we just talked
about the hippocampus,

01:03:53.230 --> 01:03:55.780
so this is a different area of
the brain, the hypothalamus.

01:03:55.780 --> 01:03:58.360
It's going to be very
important on Monday as well,

01:03:58.360 --> 01:04:01.220
when Tom and Will talk
about the endocrine system,

01:04:01.220 --> 01:04:03.730
because the
hypothalamus directly

01:04:03.730 --> 01:04:06.720
affects the pituitary
gland, which is center

01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:08.190
of your endocrine system.

01:04:08.190 --> 01:04:13.000
So basically, the hypothalamus
here contains the cell bodies,

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:16.580
or is just one synapse away
from all the cell bodies

01:04:16.580 --> 01:04:19.480
that project onto
the target organs,

01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:21.600
from the spinal cord
to the target organs.

01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:25.270
So basically, the hypothalamus
will tell the spinal cord

01:04:25.270 --> 01:04:28.460
what to project onto the organ.

01:04:28.460 --> 01:04:31.650
So an example of this
would be in your heart.

01:04:31.650 --> 01:04:33.810
And this is actually
called the baroreflex.

01:04:33.810 --> 01:04:36.900
And this is just an example of
how your hypothalamus is going

01:04:36.900 --> 01:04:39.550
to help your body
maintain status quo,

01:04:39.550 --> 01:04:42.490
so make sure that your blood
pressure's never too high,

01:04:42.490 --> 01:04:44.400
your heart's beating
at a normal speed.

01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:46.040
So let's say you're
hemorrhaging,

01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:50.530
because I don't know, a
hyena just attacked you.

01:04:50.530 --> 01:04:52.800
That's weird.

01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:54.310
So anyways, you're hemorrhaging.

01:04:54.310 --> 01:04:56.150
And you're losing
a lot of blood,

01:04:56.150 --> 01:04:58.480
so your blood pressure's
going to go way down.

01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:01.040
And you have these receptors
in your blood vessels

01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:03.000
that are called baroreceptors.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.650
And they'll say, OK, blood
pressure's way too low.

01:05:05.650 --> 01:05:06.460
What do I do?

01:05:06.460 --> 01:05:09.400
They're going to send that
info to the hypothalamus--

01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:11.740
remember the hypothalamus,
center of regulation.

01:05:11.740 --> 01:05:13.820
And the hypothalamus
will be in charge

01:05:13.820 --> 01:05:15.520
of sending that
information along

01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:18.960
to the spinal cord, which will
then project onto the heart

01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:20.200
and tell it to beat faster.

01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:22.440
Sympathetic nervous
system will be activated.

01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:24.890
Beat faster, increase
my blood pressure,

01:05:24.890 --> 01:05:26.910
so that you'll make up
for the loss of blood

01:05:26.910 --> 01:05:29.100
that you just had.

01:05:29.100 --> 01:05:31.450
And the opposite would happen
if your blood pressure is

01:05:31.450 --> 01:05:32.870
getting too high or something.

01:05:32.870 --> 01:05:34.620
Maybe the info will
be sent to your brain.

01:05:34.620 --> 01:05:36.890
And then you can
decrease blood pressure

01:05:36.890 --> 01:05:38.770
through the parasympathetic
nervous system.

01:05:41.420 --> 01:05:46.140
So reptiles, everybody kind of
has that hypothalamus control

01:05:46.140 --> 01:05:46.880
of the-- yeah.

01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:48.796
Sorry, I had a question
about the [INAUDIBLE].

01:05:48.796 --> 01:05:50.510
This is kind of a
[INAUDIBLE] question,

01:05:50.510 --> 01:05:53.390
but is it actually stimulating
the sympathetic nervous system?

01:05:53.390 --> 01:05:56.750
Or is it normally stimulating
the parasympathetic and then

01:05:56.750 --> 01:05:59.150
stops the stimulation?

01:05:59.150 --> 01:06:02.100
Oh, because remember,
one's on or off.

01:06:02.100 --> 01:06:06.740
So like which one's normally on?

01:06:06.740 --> 01:06:08.210
Do you guys know?

01:06:08.210 --> 01:06:09.422
Anybody know?

01:06:09.422 --> 01:06:11.776
There's just a baseline
balance [INAUDIBLE].

01:06:11.776 --> 01:06:12.276
Yeah.

01:06:16.860 --> 01:06:21.050
So what about mammals?

01:06:21.050 --> 01:06:22.350
Mammals have emotions.

01:06:22.350 --> 01:06:24.640
And we have an
emotional regulation

01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:27.580
are in our brain that's
called the limbic system.

01:06:27.580 --> 01:06:30.090
And we're going to learn
a whole lecture just

01:06:30.090 --> 01:06:31.719
about the limbic
system in general.

01:06:31.719 --> 01:06:34.260
But basically, it has everything
do with emotions, behaviors,

01:06:34.260 --> 01:06:38.600
memories, all
mammalian type things.

01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:43.570
So now we see this realm where
not just losing all your blood

01:06:43.570 --> 01:06:45.650
can activate or stimulate
the nervous system

01:06:45.650 --> 01:06:48.500
and cause a parasympathetic
or sympathetic response.

01:06:48.500 --> 01:06:51.176
But now just seeing
someone you hate

01:06:51.176 --> 01:06:52.800
can cause a sympathetic
response that's

01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:55.110
very similar to
losing a lot of blood.

01:06:55.110 --> 01:06:56.620
And this is pretty amazing.

01:06:56.620 --> 01:06:59.930
Wildebeests, for instance,
if they see their enemies,

01:06:59.930 --> 01:07:02.560
the info will be sent from
just the smell of their enemies

01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:06.400
to the limbic system, project
onto the hypothalamus, spinal

01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:08.810
cord, to the sympathetic
nervous system,

01:07:08.810 --> 01:07:13.220
be like, I don't
like you response.

01:07:13.220 --> 01:07:14.820
The sympathetic
nervous system wanting

01:07:14.820 --> 01:07:16.250
to either fight or flight.

01:07:19.820 --> 01:07:22.650
And then in the
realm of primates,

01:07:22.650 --> 01:07:24.940
we also have our cortex.

01:07:24.940 --> 01:07:28.340
And what the cortex does is
it makes thoughts and memories

01:07:28.340 --> 01:07:29.450
really important.

01:07:29.450 --> 01:07:32.570
So now, instead of just
having-- losing a lot of blood,

01:07:32.570 --> 01:07:35.620
we're changing how
our body functions.

01:07:35.620 --> 01:07:38.116
And now, not even
having to sense-- we

01:07:38.116 --> 01:07:39.240
don't need to have a sense.

01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:41.090
We can just think
about a thought.

01:07:41.090 --> 01:07:42.910
And that can go ahead
and change the way

01:07:42.910 --> 01:07:45.190
that every organ in
our body functions,

01:07:45.190 --> 01:07:47.140
which is pretty amazing.

01:07:47.140 --> 01:07:49.540
So when you're thinking
about a test, for instance,

01:07:49.540 --> 01:07:51.810
you're going to
activate your cortex.

01:07:51.810 --> 01:07:54.146
And this will activate your
limbic system, and then

01:07:54.146 --> 01:07:54.895
your hypothalamus.

01:07:54.895 --> 01:07:59.430
So that's known, actually, as
the triune system of the brain.

01:07:59.430 --> 01:08:02.520
You have the cortex
in primates, mostly.

01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:06.280
Then you have the limbic
system, mostly mammalian.

01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:08.910
And then you have
the hypothalamus.

01:08:08.910 --> 01:08:12.164
So it's going to go to each one
of these layers of the brain.

01:08:12.164 --> 01:08:13.580
And just thinking
about a test can

01:08:13.580 --> 01:08:15.050
cause a sympathetic
response, where

01:08:15.050 --> 01:08:17.939
you start sweating, getting
nervous, stressed out.

01:08:17.939 --> 01:08:21.810
And it's pretty amazing that
if you lost a lot of blood

01:08:21.810 --> 01:08:24.719
in a reptile, we can stimulate
the same response just

01:08:24.719 --> 01:08:26.260
thinking about
something, or thinking

01:08:26.260 --> 01:08:28.970
about someone on the other
side of the world dying.

01:08:28.970 --> 01:08:32.189
It's just amazing
what primates can do.

01:08:32.189 --> 01:08:34.590
And an interesting
example of this-- and I

01:08:34.590 --> 01:08:36.910
think we're having a lecture
on depression, so I don't

01:08:36.910 --> 01:08:38.770
want to give it all away yet.

01:08:38.770 --> 01:08:41.380
But if you think
about it, the symptoms

01:08:41.380 --> 01:08:45.109
of depression, loss of
pleasure, pain pathways on,

01:08:45.109 --> 01:08:47.214
don't want to have
sex, aren't in the mood

01:08:47.214 --> 01:08:51.550
to eat, you're exhausted all the
time, a lot of these symptoms

01:08:51.550 --> 01:08:53.290
are the same symptoms
you would see

01:08:53.290 --> 01:08:56.910
if your sympathetic nervous
system was overly activated.

01:08:56.910 --> 01:08:59.560
And we can see how the
cortex having bad thoughts

01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:02.126
can go and activate that
system in the same way, links

01:09:02.126 --> 01:09:02.709
to depression.

01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:08.170
And the last thing
I wanted to talk

01:09:08.170 --> 01:09:10.520
about in terms of the
autonomic nervous system

01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:12.460
was the plasticity of it.

01:09:12.460 --> 01:09:15.862
So we just learned the
plasticity in neurons,

01:09:15.862 --> 01:09:17.170
in the synapses.

01:09:17.170 --> 01:09:20.090
So that's when it
can change over time.

01:09:20.090 --> 01:09:22.770
And the autonomic nervous system
can actually change over time,

01:09:22.770 --> 01:09:26.109
in terms of how receptive,
or when it turns on and off.

01:09:26.109 --> 01:09:28.260
And a molecular
example of this is

01:09:28.260 --> 01:09:29.970
if you're a very
stressful person,

01:09:29.970 --> 01:09:31.990
and you're stressing
all the time.

01:09:31.990 --> 01:09:34.280
Well, then you need a
lot of norepinephrine.

01:09:34.280 --> 01:09:36.279
What do you do if you're
stressing all the time?

01:09:36.279 --> 01:09:39.290
You increase the
synthesis of the enzyme

01:09:39.290 --> 01:09:42.569
called tyrosine
hydroxylase, I believe.

01:09:42.569 --> 01:09:43.710
Yeah, it's up there.

01:09:43.710 --> 01:09:45.584
And basically, this is
the rate limiting step

01:09:45.584 --> 01:09:46.660
in making norepinephrine.

01:09:46.660 --> 01:09:48.500
So if you increase
more of the enzyme,

01:09:48.500 --> 01:09:50.810
you increase more of
the norepinephrine,

01:09:50.810 --> 01:09:53.960
you can sustain the
stress response.

01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:56.500
Another example,
cellular example,

01:09:56.500 --> 01:10:00.370
is that we have projections from
the sympathetic nervous system

01:10:00.370 --> 01:10:03.150
to the skin, eyes,
nose, everything

01:10:03.150 --> 01:10:04.960
that's going on out there.

01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:07.760
And let's say we
see something scary.

01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:11.660
We can make those receptors more
sensitive to that scary thing.

01:10:11.660 --> 01:10:14.860
So we can say, hey, it
actually smells that enemy.

01:10:14.860 --> 01:10:16.520
We can make it seem scarier.

01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:19.380
The sympathetic nervous
system can turn on faster,

01:10:19.380 --> 01:10:21.130
so sensitization.

01:10:21.130 --> 01:10:23.500
There's also the opposite
end of the spectrum,

01:10:23.500 --> 01:10:28.300
where you habituate to things
that are going on outside.

01:10:28.300 --> 01:10:31.650
So scary stimuli--
if you see a spider

01:10:31.650 --> 01:10:33.140
in your room the
first time, you're

01:10:33.140 --> 01:10:35.300
probably going to freak
out when you're younger.

01:10:35.300 --> 01:10:37.800
Lots of sympathetic activity,
running away, fight or flight.

01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:41.442
You decide to fly, because
I don't like spiders.

01:10:41.442 --> 01:10:43.900
But basically, after a while,
second time you see a spider,

01:10:43.900 --> 01:10:45.210
you're just like, oh,
this is still scary.

01:10:45.210 --> 01:10:46.310
Maybe I'll run away.

01:10:46.310 --> 01:10:48.675
The third time,
maybe you decide,

01:10:48.675 --> 01:10:51.050
whatever, I'm just going to
leave it there at this point.

01:10:51.050 --> 01:10:52.450
And you're habituated to it.

01:10:52.450 --> 01:10:56.840
So you've made the thresholds
of your sensory receptors,

01:10:56.840 --> 01:10:57.890
they don't care as much.

01:10:57.890 --> 01:11:00.400
They don't respond as much.

01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:03.950
And a last example, when we're
talking about cognitive thought

01:11:03.950 --> 01:11:05.550
and the cortex and
what that can do

01:11:05.550 --> 01:11:09.050
to change our autonomic
nervous system,

01:11:09.050 --> 01:11:12.290
is an example of biofeedback
and blood pressure.

01:11:12.290 --> 01:11:15.980
So basically, if you
have high blood pressure,

01:11:15.980 --> 01:11:18.000
you can go into the
doctor's office.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:19.940
And you have two options.

01:11:19.940 --> 01:11:22.976
You can take medicine, or
you could try biofeedback.

01:11:22.976 --> 01:11:24.350
And what they do
is they tell you

01:11:24.350 --> 01:11:25.850
to think of a pleasant thought.

01:11:25.850 --> 01:11:28.306
So think of your
favorite vacation,

01:11:28.306 --> 01:11:29.680
or think of your
favorite person,

01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:31.689
or just think of the
beach in general.

01:11:31.689 --> 01:11:34.230
And what you'll see is that your
blood pressure will actually

01:11:34.230 --> 01:11:36.010
decrease with a certain thought.

01:11:36.010 --> 01:11:37.760
And then the doctor
will tell you to think

01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:39.040
about that thought again.

01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:41.050
Your blood pressure
will decrease.

01:11:41.050 --> 01:11:43.370
And thinking more and
more about that thought,

01:11:43.370 --> 01:11:45.580
helping your blood
pressure decrease,

01:11:45.580 --> 01:11:49.360
what you do is you potentiate,
remember, you make stronger

01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:53.170
the connection where a
cortical thought can go ahead

01:11:53.170 --> 01:11:56.590
and activate more
parasympathetic tone,

01:11:56.590 --> 01:11:57.950
have less sympathetic tone.

01:11:57.950 --> 01:11:59.700
So we're potentiating
that pathway

01:11:59.700 --> 01:12:03.876
by which a thought can cause
our blood pressure to decrease,

01:12:03.876 --> 01:12:04.750
which is pretty cool.

01:12:08.210 --> 01:12:11.040
So the take home points,
if you want to just know

01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:13.637
what to remember from this.

01:12:13.637 --> 01:12:15.470
Know the broad difference
between autonomic,

01:12:15.470 --> 01:12:18.030
automatic, and the voluntary
nervous system, what we

01:12:18.030 --> 01:12:20.660
talked about at the beginning.

01:12:20.660 --> 01:12:23.680
Understand the neurotransmitters
involved in each,

01:12:23.680 --> 01:12:26.020
and why you need two
types of receptors,

01:12:26.020 --> 01:12:28.442
the inhibitory and excitatory.

01:12:28.442 --> 01:12:31.400
Know one or two examples of
what the parasympathetic--

01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:33.250
that's what PNS,
by the way, means--

01:12:33.250 --> 01:12:35.560
and sympathetic nervous
system do to an organ.

01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:39.820
So remember the heart,
the digestive tract,

01:12:39.820 --> 01:12:42.380
the male reproductive system.

01:12:42.380 --> 01:12:45.640
And then know a broad overview
of how the brain regulates

01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:50.270
the autonomic nervous system,
so hypothalamus, cortex,

01:12:50.270 --> 01:12:53.230
and we have the limbic system.

01:12:53.230 --> 01:12:56.400
On Monday, we're going
over endocrinology.

01:12:56.400 --> 01:12:58.300
So have a good--

01:12:58.300 --> 01:13:01.550

[MUSIC SWELLING]

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:05.950
Stanford University.

00:00:08.307 --> 00:00:09.390
Can you hear me like this?

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:10.060
Is this better?

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:10.325
Yes.

00:00:10.325 --> 00:00:10.825
Yes.

00:00:10.825 --> 00:00:12.610
OK, great.

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:15.120
So yeah, so like Tom said,
feel free at any point

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.412
to interrupt us with questions.

00:00:16.412 --> 00:00:18.328
Just raise your hand if
something's confusing,

00:00:18.328 --> 00:00:19.040
stuff like that.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.840
Also, just like with
the other lectures,

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.530
feel free to email
us after class.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:24.386
Our emails are on CourseWare.

00:00:24.386 --> 00:00:25.637
You can find us that way.

00:00:25.637 --> 00:00:27.970
So today, we're gonna provide
a little bit of background

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.140
context introducing sort
of [INAUDIBLE] place

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.390
in the context of the other
sort of buckets of this class,

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.410
or I guess sort of think
about it generally.

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.200
We're gonna talk
specifically then

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.925
about peptide and
steroid hormones,

00:00:39.925 --> 00:00:41.285
different types of hormones.

00:00:41.285 --> 00:00:43.920
Then we're gonna see some
specific interesting things

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.082
about them that you
might want to know.

00:00:46.082 --> 00:00:48.730
Then we're gonna talk about how
the brain controls hormones.

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.580
So hormone release, and
then eventually feeding back

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.760
to how hormones
influence the brain.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.600
Sort of this dual communication
system that's pretty neat.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.410
But we're gonna touch on
all those things today.

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.020
So Tom's gonna start out
with some background context.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.660
OK.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.760
So way back when, when life
first arose, things was--

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.700
were inside single cells, right.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.150
Individuals were
single cells who

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.060
had to interact with
their environment.

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.395
They had to get food, they
had to get rid of waste,

00:01:16.395 --> 00:01:19.020
they had to make sure they were
in the right pH and temperature

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.420
so that they could do
well for themselves.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.810
And as a single cell, it seems
like a simple enough task.

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.340
But as things got
more complicated

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.470
and multicellular
life arose, there

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.070
arose a really big,
important issue

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.280
for life, which is how
cells talk to each other.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.960
Cellular communication, OK?

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.870
And you don't have to
worry too much about,

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.320
like, the jargony
words like paracrine.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.080
But it's kind of
worth thinking about.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.510
There are four main ways that
cells can talk to each other.

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.990
The first one being
cell-cell contact,

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.210
where you actually have one
cell physically touching

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.470
another cell.

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.070
And that seems pretty
understandable.

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.920
It's got to be really,
really short range.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.640
And it's just gonna be this
cell talking to another cell.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.580
We've got paracrine, which
is a little more short range.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.750
And you guys have heard
about neuronal and endocrine.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.080
And I'm gonna try to put these
examples of communication

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.120
in the context of us, as a
giant, multicellular organism.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.840
This class, right now, OK?

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.887
So who wants to be the pancreas?

00:02:23.887 --> 00:02:25.220
No one wants to be the pancreas.

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.210
OK, we've got a
pancreas right there.

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:27.120
Thank you very much.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.870
No, we don't have to
be specialized cells.

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.250
But the point is that
a cell-cell contact

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.070
in our organism would
be actually someone

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.140
physically handing you
a note during class, OK?

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.706
You actually-- and it's just
one to one, short and easy.

00:02:40.706 --> 00:02:43.080
Not gonna-- not a lot of people
are gonna know about that

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.210
signal.

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:46.480
Paracrine is more
like kind of you

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.720
whispering to a bunch
of neighbors, right.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.410
A couple people can hear you.

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:51.750
It happens pretty quick.

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.170
But it's not widespread.

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.994
Neuronal is something that is
really important to this class,

00:02:56.994 --> 00:02:58.910
and it's something you've
heard about already.

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.900
This is the equivalent
of texting your friend

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.210
during class, OK?

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:04.130
I saw Bill Loundy
texting someone earlier.

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:05.140
I was a little offended.

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.730
So if you could put your phone
away, sir, that'd be great.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.930
And the key to
neuronal transmission

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.890
is that it's really about
electrical movement, OK?

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.160
That's why it happens
so fast, because I've

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.380
got neurons that span
all the way from here

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.680
to through my spinal
cord, or from all

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.710
the way from my spinal cord
out to the tips of my fingers,

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:28.750
and that's just
electrical transmission

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.560
via action potentials, which
you've learned a lot about.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.796
Now, granted, when one neuron
talks to the next neuron,

00:03:35.796 --> 00:03:36.670
it's kind of a relay.

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.150
It's got to use a
neurotransmitter

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:39.742
to communicate that.

00:03:39.742 --> 00:03:42.200
But you can really focus, for
the purposes of this example,

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.570
on that fast electrical
action potential thing.

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.190
And the fact that it's a
lot more specific than what

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.590
we're about to see, which is
endocrine, which is long-range.

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.210
It's all about
chemical messengers

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:57.640
traveling through
the bloodstream.

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.570
Hormones in the blood.

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:01.810
That's what endocrine
signals are about.

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.370
This is a lot more like Steven
sending you guys an email

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.370
to the entire class,
but it takes a long time

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:09.471
to get there, right?

00:04:09.471 --> 00:04:10.970
It's gonna take a
little bit longer,

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.510
but it's gonna
enable us as a class

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.940
to coordinate our
behavior so we all show up

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.190
to the right place at the right
time, wearing the right thing,

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:20.390
whatever.

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:21.320
OK.

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.160
So you guys get that.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.314
Questions about those different
mechanisms of communication?

00:04:26.314 --> 00:04:27.110
OK.

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:28.990
So endocrine clearly
the focus of today.

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.500
Things are traveling
through the bloodstream.

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.130
It's gonna take a
while to get there,

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.500
but it's gonna be--
allow us to coordinate

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:37.600
a lot of different things.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.340
Now, what would we
want to coordinate?

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.630
Two kind of really exciting
things that we can coordinate.

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:46.490
One is these giant
transformations

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:47.970
that occur during life.

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.307
Things like
metamorphosis of-- good,

00:04:52.307 --> 00:04:53.640
I see some mimicking back there.

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:54.348
That's very good.

00:04:54.348 --> 00:04:57.080
I want everyone to do
this with me right now.

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.170
Metamorphosis.

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:59.310
Good.

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.550
So basically, you want all
the cells in that organism

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.610
to kind of change in
coordination with each other.

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.330
Same thing for a
couple other things

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.370
which I'm about to talk about.

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:10.839
That's in contrast
to-- it doesn't

00:05:10.839 --> 00:05:12.380
have to be an adult
organism, it just

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.870
has to be a functioning
organism who

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:16.710
is in a certain environment.

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.190
And in that
environment, oh, crap,

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:20.390
I need to get all my
cells on the same page,

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:24.670
because we've got to address
this particular environmental

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:25.700
thing.

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.330
So I'll give you
a couple examples.

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:32.230
One really great coordinated
developmental transformation

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:36.140
was the transition
from young Harry Potter

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:37.960
to Daniel Radcliffe, right.

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.400
He was in that weird horseplay
thing, got a lot of publicity.

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.530
And you can see, like,
a lot of his cells

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:48.440
had to change kind of
all at the same time.

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.330
And you get the point.

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.320
Same thing, I've kind
of mentioned these.

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.730
As opposed to a kind
of coordinated response

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:58.740
into a specific
environmental thing,

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:00.690
which might be a
stressful situation.

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:02.690
We're gonna hear about
that a little bit later.

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:05.190
You want to make sure
all your organs and cells

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:06.820
are doing the right
thing for stress

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:10.120
mode or sexual arousal
mode, whatever it is.

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:13.720
And we're gonna hear a little
bit more about that later.

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:14.832
So Will has the mic.

00:06:14.832 --> 00:06:17.290
All right, so that's sort of
the background context putting

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:19.389
that stuff into play for today.

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:20.930
So there's some very
important things

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:22.804
that you have to know
about hormones overall.

00:06:22.804 --> 00:06:24.827
We wrote here peptide
versus steroid.

00:06:24.827 --> 00:06:26.660
There'd technically a
third kind of hormone,

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:29.654
which is single amino
acid [INAUDIBLE] hormones.

00:06:29.654 --> 00:06:31.820
But we're basically gonna
talk about the distinction

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:33.680
between peptide and
steroid hormones

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:37.480
today, and sort of
structural differences

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.640
and what that means in
terms of their transport

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:42.942
in the bloodstream, the effect
they have on target cells.

00:06:42.942 --> 00:06:44.400
And then we'll see
different things

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:47.860
about their duration and
other cool things like that.

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:50.780
So the structure generally,
as you can see here,

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:54.180
we put up a picture of
insulin in peptide form.

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:55.990
We wanted to make it
look like a protein.

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:57.489
Peptides, of course,
and amino acids

00:06:57.489 --> 00:06:59.670
being the precursors
to proteins.

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:04.000
We see sort of here this is a
typical peptide hormone made

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.360
from amino acid precursors.

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.070
And a key term
associated with this

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:09.350
is the notion that
it's hydrophilic.

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:11.820
So this idea that
it's water-loving.

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:14.639
This plays into the sort of
transport mechanisms involved

00:07:14.639 --> 00:07:17.180
with it, and other things which
we'll talk about in a moment.

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:19.830
So peptide hormones
made from amino acids,

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:21.131
hydrophilic, water-loving.

00:07:21.131 --> 00:07:22.130
We'll see some examples.

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:23.970
You've heard of some already.

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:29.057
Insulin, vasopressin,
oxytocin, ACTH, CRH, and more.

00:07:29.057 --> 00:07:30.640
And then we also
have steroid hormones

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:33.780
So these are made from
cholesterol precursors.

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:35.560
They're hydrophobic,
water-hating.

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:38.553
Another term we associate
with this is lipophilic,

00:07:38.553 --> 00:07:39.680
liking of lipids.

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.680
When we talk about the
cellular membrane being

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:44.980
made of a phospholipid
bilayer, steroid hormones

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:46.959
are hydrophobic or lipophilic.

00:07:46.959 --> 00:07:49.250
They're able to pass through
this phospholipid bilayer.

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:52.190
Ends up being very important for
their mechanism inside target

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:53.930
cells.

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:55.470
So some examples of this.

00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:57.706
Classic example,
glucocorticoids.

00:07:57.706 --> 00:07:59.955
We're gonna see those
all over the place.

00:07:59.955 --> 00:08:01.920
We already had talked
about them a bit.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:05.250
Androgens, estrogen,
things like that.

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:07.530
Something really interesting
about the structure

00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:08.660
of the hormones.

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:11.994
So if we take a
steroid hormone-- OK,

00:08:11.994 --> 00:08:13.410
so I'm not gonna
draw [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:17.300
I'm gonna draw a single amino
acid, which this actually

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:20.715
is nothing-- looks nothing like
a single amino acid hormone.

00:08:20.715 --> 00:08:23.110
But you sort of bear
with me and pretend here.

00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:25.730
So a lot of these
hormones, steroid hormones,

00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:27.710
single amino acid
hormones, peptide hormones,

00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:29.665
they come from similar
precursors, right?

00:08:29.665 --> 00:08:31.770
You have peptide hormones,
it's amino acids.

00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:33.980
And single amino acids,
it's often from tyrosine,

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:37.630
and steroid hormones is from
these cholesterol precursors.

00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:39.240
Why is this interesting?

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:40.820
It's interesting
because, when they

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:42.340
come from the same
precursor, they

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:43.559
end up looking very similar.

00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:45.770
So one might have this here.

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:47.070
So this might be one hormone.

00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:50.330
And then we might have an
identical-- a newly identical

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:53.210
one underneath.

00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:56.052
But now it has just
another sub-chemical shift.

00:08:56.052 --> 00:08:57.760
Chemical structure
doesn't really matter.

00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:00.100
The point is that, if you're
familiar with some organic

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:03.435
chemistry, you have just
subtle chemical shifts leading

00:09:03.435 --> 00:09:04.990
to different hormones.

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:07.650
Interestingly, from an
evolutionary standpoint,

00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:10.040
this suggests the
need for basically

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:14.130
having receptors specialized
for these subtle chemical

00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:16.170
differences in the hormones.

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:18.750
norepinephrine and dopamine
have just a slight difference

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:19.550
like this.

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:22.140
But the effect, if
the receptor wasn't

00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:23.890
able to distinguish
those-- between those,

00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:25.367
it would have a drastic effect.

00:09:25.367 --> 00:09:27.700
So it's very important, from
an evolutionary standpoint,

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:29.980
to have receptors
that can distinguish

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:33.990
these subtle differences in
the hormone chemical structure.

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:35.240
That sounded really technical.

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:38.080
Any questions on that
sort of general idea?

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:39.020
Is that cool?

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:40.146
OK.

00:09:40.146 --> 00:09:41.770
That does remind me
of one thing that I

00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:44.600
didn't make a
distinction between when

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:47.670
I was talking about neuronal
versus hormonal transport.

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:50.420
A lot of times, we will kind
of throw out these words,

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:51.930
and there's a lot
of jargony words.

00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:53.490
Norepinephrine,
blah, blah, blah.

00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:55.940
And it's kind of
good in your mind

00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:59.400
to be able to separate
between hormones, things that

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:00.990
are really these
classic things that

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:04.410
travel through the blood as
signals, and neurotransmitters.

00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:07.470
Neurotransmitters being
they're also chemicals,

00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:09.730
and they also need to
communicate cell to cell,

00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:12.370
but they are gonna be
just in that synapse, OK.

00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:14.120
From one neuron to the
next in the synapse

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:15.453
that you've already heard about.

00:10:15.453 --> 00:10:17.900
And just to make your
guys' lives awesome,

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:19.760
there can be overlap.

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:23.000
There can be neurons that
release their neurotransmitter

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.190
into the blood, at which
point they become hormones.

00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:29.740
So things like dopamine
and epinephrine, right.

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:32.350
Things you might associate
with neurotransmitters

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:35.990
can also be hormones, depending
on what context and all

00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:36.490
that stuff.

00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:38.060
So just something
to really focus

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:41.530
your attention on when you're
distinguishing these signals.

00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:42.510
OK, cool, thanks.

00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:45.547
So yeah, so we talked about
the structure very briefly.

00:10:45.547 --> 00:10:48.130
From that structure, we can talk
about sort of the differences

00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:48.910
in transport.

00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:52.550
We talked hydrophobic
versus hydrophilic.

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:55.830
The images-- should have done
an animation-style pop-up.

00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:58.260
So our peptide hormones
are gonna be water-soluble.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.426
They're gonna travel freely
through the bloodstream.

00:11:00.426 --> 00:11:02.080
We have-- I guess
our example here is

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:03.970
people riding a roller coaster.

00:11:03.970 --> 00:11:07.430
These monks are just
riding free, looking good.

00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:08.870
You can imagine
the monks as sort

00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:11.930
of examples of these
peptide hormones traveling

00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:13.750
freely, dissolved
through the bloodstream.

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:15.540
Not really dissolved,
but that's OK.

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:19.200
So peptide hormones traveling
freely through the bloodstream.

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:21.300
Steroid hormones,
however, they're

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:24.400
not water-soluble, so they need
to be bound to a chaperone.

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:29.830
This is our example of a
chaperone guiding this hormone

00:11:29.830 --> 00:11:32.194
through the bloodstream.

00:11:32.194 --> 00:11:35.320
So this is-- it's just sort
of an interesting thing

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:37.240
to note about their transport.

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:40.910
We may talk about this a
little later in other contexts.

00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:43.300
Other interesting things we
can learn from the structure.

00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:45.742
So, interaction with
the target cell.

00:11:45.742 --> 00:11:47.700
When Thomas was talking
about the context here,

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:50.190
it's really that we
understand how hormones

00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:51.680
interact with cells, right?

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:55.022
They require a specific receptor
for each individual hormone.

00:11:55.022 --> 00:11:56.480
We talked about
the importance sort

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:58.046
of the specificity of that.

00:11:58.046 --> 00:11:59.920
Peptide hormones and
steroid hormones sort of

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:01.920
have generalized
mechanisms that we're

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:03.620
gonna talk about,
ways in which they

00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:05.690
interact with target cells.

00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:09.980
Peptide hormones
on the left here.

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:12.980
So peptide hormones, because
they can travel freely

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:15.760
through the bloodstream-- or
I'm sorry, let me step back.

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:18.010
They can travel freely through
the bloodstream because

00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:19.740
of their structural properties.

00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:22.760
However, those same
structural properties,

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:26.180
the fact that
they're hydrophilic,

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:27.880
prevents them from
being able to travel

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:31.270
through the phospholipid
bilayer of a cellular membrane.

00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:33.880
So the receptors
for peptide hormones

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:35.430
are on the surface
of these cells.

00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:38.310
They're surface receptor
cellular membrane sort

00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:41.120
of-- the receptors are
on the cellular membrane.

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:43.916
Because of that,
they're typically

00:12:43.916 --> 00:12:46.290
associated with these what
are called secondary messenger

00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:48.082
responses.

00:12:48.082 --> 00:12:50.040
The details of this-- I
think a lot of you guys

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:52.712
have been exposed to this
in all sorts of biology

00:12:52.712 --> 00:12:53.420
or human biology.

00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:55.250
But if you haven't,
generally what happens

00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:58.900
is a peptide hormone binds to a
receptor of the cell membrane,

00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:01.820
and then sets off what we always
call this cascade response.

00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:05.100
The secondary messenger
cascade response.

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:06.630
This is actually
really interesting.

00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:08.809
It can lead to a number
of different effects.

00:13:08.809 --> 00:13:10.350
One thing it can
do, which we'll talk

00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:12.280
about when this
is a neuron, is it

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:15.300
can activate ion
channels, sort of helping

00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:16.577
ion channels to open or close.

00:13:16.577 --> 00:13:19.160
We'll talk about that in terms
of membrane potential later on.

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:21.618
Another thing it can do-- and
this is the classical example

00:13:21.618 --> 00:13:24.119
with peptide hormones--
is it sets off

00:13:24.119 --> 00:13:25.660
this secondary
messenger cascade that

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:29.040
affects proteins within the
cell, directly within the cell.

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:30.550
So we can think of
peptide hormones

00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:35.320
generally as having action
on proteins within the cell.

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:37.250
And that's sort
of the end effect

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:38.920
of the secondary
messenger cascade.

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:42.030
They also technically
can go into the nucleus

00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:43.260
and affect transcription.

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:46.281
However, that we tend to
associate more with steroids.

00:13:46.281 --> 00:13:48.780
And we'll look at some of the
complexities and complications

00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:49.510
of this later on.

00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:50.940
You'll hear about this.

00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:53.150
But I would say generally,
it's important to note

00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:54.900
that we tend to associate
peptide hormones

00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:57.360
with these secondary
messenger cascades affecting

00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:02.320
the proteins existing within
the cell at the moment.

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:04.810
The onset tends to
be relatively quick,

00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:06.970
and the duration is
relatively short.

00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:09.590
We're gonna talk about this in
comparison to steroid hormones.

00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:13.652
And we can see why the relative
onset duration is different.

00:14:13.652 --> 00:14:15.315
So because it's
affecting proton--

00:14:15.315 --> 00:14:18.970
or proteins that exist, it's--
we can say that the duration is

00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:20.060
relatively short.

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:23.220
And as we said here, it may
affect protein activity.

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:24.890
Steroid hormones,
by contrast, they

00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:27.700
travel through the blood
on these chaperone protein

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:28.740
carriers.

00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:31.090
And then when they
get to a cell,

00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:33.470
they're able to diffuse
through the membrane

00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:37.160
and actually bind to receptors
located within the cell.

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:40.160
Classically, we talk
about steroid hormones

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:42.567
passing through the membrane,
binding to a receptor,

00:14:42.567 --> 00:14:44.150
and then going
directly to the nucleus

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:45.870
to affect transcription.

00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:48.530
So this is sort of
our classic example.

00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:50.720
Main effect, transcription.

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:54.230
The onset, then, slower,
and the duration longer.

00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:57.270
It takes longer to start these
transcriptional processes,

00:14:57.270 --> 00:14:58.870
and it's lasting a lot longer.

00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:01.670
We're changing the rate
of synthesis of proteins,

00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:06.020
rather than changing the
proteins that currently exist.

00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:06.795
OK.

00:15:06.795 --> 00:15:08.670
As always, feel free to
interrupt if anything

00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:10.300
seems sort of confusing.

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:14.930
So those are sort of some
of the generic examples.

00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:18.160
We-- insulin would be a classic
example of a peptide hormone.

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:20.325
Glucocorticoids is
our steroids hormone.

00:15:20.325 --> 00:15:22.670
We may-- we'll see this
coming up again and again.

00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:25.320
We may touch on this again
today in the lecture.

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:25.820
Cool.

00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:28.790
So just to recap-- does anyone
have questions off the bat?

00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:29.730
Yes?

00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:33.008
For the steroid hormones,
it's like a receptor floating

00:15:33.008 --> 00:15:34.008
in the middle of a cell.

00:15:34.008 --> 00:15:36.801
Like, would that be on the
nuclear envelope, or is it,

00:15:36.801 --> 00:15:38.076
like, on something else?

00:15:38.076 --> 00:15:38.700
Great question.

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:40.150
So the question was,
for the receptor

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:41.733
for this-- and this
image, by the way,

00:15:41.733 --> 00:15:43.260
courtesy of Professor Sapolsky.

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:45.150
Thank you, wherever you are.

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:48.745
So the receptor is located
within-- the question

00:15:48.745 --> 00:15:50.120
is where is that
receptor located

00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:51.120
for the steroid hormone.

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:53.359
Is it on the nuclear membrane,
is it within the cell.

00:15:53.359 --> 00:15:55.900
Classically, we're gonna talk
about basically receptors being

00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:57.550
located in the cytoplasm.

00:15:57.550 --> 00:16:00.080
There are examples you'll see
if you look-- even if you did

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:01.580
a Google images
search, you might

00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:04.340
find examples of steroid hormone
coming in, binding a receptor,

00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:07.450
floating in the cytoplasm that's
then taken into the nucleus.

00:16:07.450 --> 00:16:09.420
Basically, we
associate the receptors

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:10.929
as somewhere within the cell.

00:16:10.929 --> 00:16:13.220
Perhaps on the nuclear
membrane, perhaps somewhere else

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:13.928
in the cytoplasm.

00:16:13.928 --> 00:16:16.270
And the steroid hormones
bind within there,

00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:18.160
and sort of carry out
effects from that.

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:20.240
And you could
easily also imagine

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:22.270
there being a receptor
protein that's

00:16:22.270 --> 00:16:26.260
already sitting on the DNA
just waiting to be activated.

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:29.940
And then when the steroid
hormone travels the entire way

00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:32.190
into the nucleus, that's
when it hits the receptor.

00:16:32.190 --> 00:16:33.660
So yeah, both work.

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:34.950
Other questions?

00:16:34.950 --> 00:16:35.450
Yeah.

00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:38.330
What are cholesterol made of?

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:41.890
What is cholesterol made of?

00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:45.920
So cholesterol-- I have
no clue what it's made of.

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:48.920
I know generally what its
chemical structure looks like.

00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:51.450
If you look at the
steroid picture

00:16:51.450 --> 00:16:54.510
from the other page,
the chemical structure,

00:16:54.510 --> 00:16:57.450
cholesterol precursors are sort
of similar ring structures.

00:16:57.450 --> 00:16:58.620
You can look it up.

00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:01.570
I think-- it's an
interesting question.

00:17:01.570 --> 00:17:04.849
In my mind, what I
tend to associate

00:17:04.849 --> 00:17:06.854
as a relevant
question, or something

00:17:06.854 --> 00:17:08.270
that I'm trying
to get across more

00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:10.170
would be that the
steroid hormones come

00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:11.579
from cholesterol precursors.

00:17:11.579 --> 00:17:13.720
And so I sort of consider
that the baseline,

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:16.140
rather than trying to think
about what cholesterol

00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:16.910
is made from.

00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:17.869
Interesting question.

00:17:17.869 --> 00:17:18.990
Don't know off the
top of my head.

00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:20.406
And maybe the most
important thing

00:17:20.406 --> 00:17:23.730
would be that cholesterol
is hydrophobic.

00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:25.280
So if you're gonna
make stuff from

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:29.790
this hydrophobic beginning,
it's gonna be hydrophobic also.

00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:32.300
And I just want to make sure
people are completely-- those

00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:34.390
are some really jargony terms.

00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:36.280
Hydrophobic, hydrophilic.

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:38.840
There are a lot of
synonyms for those terms

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:45.090
that are equally jargony, things
like lipophilic and lipophobic.

00:17:45.090 --> 00:17:49.370
Lipo means lipid, so
something that is hydrophobic

00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:52.332
is lipophilic.

00:17:52.332 --> 00:17:54.060
That hurt anyone's brains?

00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:54.970
OK.

00:17:54.970 --> 00:17:56.636
So just kind of
maybe spend some time

00:17:56.636 --> 00:17:57.760
thinking about those words.

00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:00.520
You can kind of logic
through them pretty easily.

00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:02.310
You might also hear
people use the terms

00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:05.980
polar versus non-polar.

00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:08.570
Water is polar.

00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:12.860
So water-loving things,
hydrophilic things,

00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:14.197
tend to be polar.

00:18:14.197 --> 00:18:16.030
And hydrophobic things
tend to be non-polar.

00:18:16.030 --> 00:18:17.810
Don't worry too much
about that vocabulary.

00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:19.010
I just want you to
know that there's

00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:21.320
a lot of different words
people might throw around

00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:23.800
that all essentially are
getting at the same thing.

00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:27.870
Any other questions about
this basic setup so far?

00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:28.370
No?

00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:29.420
All right.

00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:34.930
Onto chapter two, which is
how does the brain control

00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:36.030
hormone release.

00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:38.650
We've established that
it'd be a good idea

00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:43.110
to release hormones in response
to certain environmental cues.

00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:46.500
How can we control that?

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:50.770
And as this picture shows, there
are many, many different sites

00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:53.750
in our body where we can
release hormones from.

00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:55.730
We've got the
pancreas right there.

00:18:55.730 --> 00:18:57.520
We've got the testes.

00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:01.060
We've got all these
different glands.

00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:02.727
These are just
specialized structures

00:19:02.727 --> 00:19:04.935
that can just pump this
hormone into the bloodstream,

00:19:04.935 --> 00:19:08.030
because that's what
hormones are all about.

00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:09.690
Some that will come
up will definitely

00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:12.920
be the testes, the
ovaries for females.

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:15.290
I don't know why they're
drawn on the same guy here.

00:19:15.290 --> 00:19:17.190
Kind of interesting.

00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:20.590
The pancreas, which is-- we
keep talking about this thing

00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:21.820
called insulin.

00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:23.570
That's released
from the pancreas,

00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:27.080
and it's gonna have something
to do with food and sugar

00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:28.810
and things like that.

00:19:28.810 --> 00:19:32.430
The thymus is another great
little endocrine gland.

00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:36.525
It releases thyroid-- no,
thymus releases-- oh, thymus

00:19:36.525 --> 00:19:42.170
is where-- what endocrine
signal does the thymus release?

00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:42.670
T-cells.

00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:44.080
Thymus-- t-cells?

00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:45.830
I'm not sure those
are hormones, though.

00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:48.121
So anyway, the thymus is
involved in the immune system.

00:19:48.121 --> 00:19:49.510
Let's ignore that for now.

00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:50.410
And blah, blah, blah.

00:19:50.410 --> 00:19:51.390
You guys get the point.

00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:56.550
There are many places throughout
our body that secrete hormones.

00:19:56.550 --> 00:20:00.000
And they tend to secrete
a certain signal.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.570
Now very excitingly, you'll
notice that the brain itself

00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:09.000
has some endocrine glands in it.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.500
The hypothalamus.

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:13.270
We've heard this word
hypothalamus a few times.

00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:15.720
The hypothalamus is
an endocrine gland,

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:19.470
meaning it can secrete
things into blood.

00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:22.930
The pituitary, right
next to the hypothalamus,

00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:24.415
separated by a
little blood maybe,

00:20:24.415 --> 00:20:28.650
maybe not, the pituitary
also can release hormones

00:20:28.650 --> 00:20:30.760
into the blood.

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:35.290
And these other kind of
lower-down peripheral endocrine

00:20:35.290 --> 00:20:41.530
glands often are regulated
by those big master endocrine

00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:43.042
glands in the brain.

00:20:43.042 --> 00:20:45.500
I don't know if you guys have
been reading your zebras yet,

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:47.680
but I think Professor
Sapolsky referred

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:53.454
to these as the brain is the
master of these witless organs.

00:20:53.454 --> 00:20:54.870
These guys are
just kind of, like,

00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:57.120
doing whatever the
brain tells them to do.

00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:01.340
And it's the brain controlling,
via the hypothalamus

00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:03.400
and the pituitary,
is going to be

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:06.140
able to control how much
testosterone is coming out

00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:08.740
of those testes.

00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:09.690
Does that make sense?

00:21:09.690 --> 00:21:13.950
The brain controls these
peripheral endocrine glands.

00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:19.050
OK, so let's zoom in on
that hypothalamus pituitary

00:21:19.050 --> 00:21:19.901
situation.

00:21:19.901 --> 00:21:21.900
Will really didn't want
to include this picture,

00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:26.030
but I thought it was hilarious,
and I can't explain why.

00:21:26.030 --> 00:21:27.230
Maybe it's the ponytail.

00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:29.390
I'm not sure.

00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:30.970
But we're just
kind of focusing in

00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:33.800
on these two different parts.

00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:39.990
And you'll notice maybe that
with-- something to take away

00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:44.370
from this picture is
simply that the brain is

00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:47.290
kind of feeding into
the hypothalamus, which

00:21:47.290 --> 00:21:49.350
is feeding into the pituitary.

00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:53.500
So when we see something,
that information is processed

00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:56.440
in our brain, can tell our
hypothalamus oh crap, oh, crap,

00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:57.330
it's stressful.

00:21:57.330 --> 00:21:58.460
It can tell the pituitary.

00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:01.670
And we get this-- eventually,
we can tell the rest of our body

00:22:01.670 --> 00:22:04.410
what to do via hormones.

00:22:04.410 --> 00:22:05.050
Awesome.

00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:07.481
Goodbye, ponytail lady.

00:22:07.481 --> 00:22:07.980
OK.

00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:11.800
Here's another just classic,
classic Sapolsky image here

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:13.642
that we were able to borrow.

00:22:13.642 --> 00:22:15.790
And this is zooming
in, once again,

00:22:15.790 --> 00:22:17.130
on just the hypothalamus.

00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:19.664
And now we're really, really
looking at the pituitary.

00:22:19.664 --> 00:22:21.080
And this is where
things are gonna

00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:22.770
kind of hit the
fan a little bit,

00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:27.230
so I went everyone to put your
A-game on, to mix a metaphor.

00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:28.720
OK.

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:30.740
So the pituitary.

00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:33.242
The pituitary are these
two kind of things dangling

00:22:33.242 --> 00:22:34.200
below the hypothalamus.

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:35.960
A lot of weird pictures of them.

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:39.120
This one's nice
because it clearly

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:43.927
divides the anterior pituitary
from the posterior pituitary.

00:22:43.927 --> 00:22:46.010
And we're gonna make some
really, really important

00:22:46.010 --> 00:22:49.780
distinctions that hopefully
you can grasp from this image.

00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:51.450
And if you can't, let me know.

00:22:51.450 --> 00:22:52.120
OK.

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:59.170
So first of all, the anterior
pituitary secretes hormones.

00:22:59.170 --> 00:23:00.770
It secretes these
things over here.

00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:02.440
I'll talk about
them in a second.

00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:06.850
The posterior pituitary secretes
a different set of hormones,

00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:08.100
these ones over here.

00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:09.450
That's one distinction.

00:23:09.450 --> 00:23:11.480
Another really
interesting distinction

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:17.550
is how the hypothalamus
regulates that secretion.

00:23:17.550 --> 00:23:18.560
OK?

00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:22.860
On the anterior side of
things, the hypothalamus,

00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:26.880
being an endocrine
gland, can actually

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:31.470
drop some hormones into that
little red river of blood

00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:32.960
right there.

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:35.750
So the hypothalamus is
actually releasing a hormone

00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:40.440
into the blood, and that travels
down to the posterior pituitary

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:43.850
and tells those-- sorry, the
anterior pituitary, sorry--

00:23:43.850 --> 00:23:46.990
and tells those
cells to then release

00:23:46.990 --> 00:23:48.842
another hormone into the blood.

00:23:48.842 --> 00:23:50.300
And once they're
in the blood, they

00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:52.500
can go all the way down
to those other target

00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:53.640
organs we talked about.

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:54.650
So that's one system.

00:23:54.650 --> 00:23:56.640
You've gotta actually
travel through the blood

00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:59.120
in the anterior pituitary.

00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:02.910
The posterior
pituitary is actually

00:24:02.910 --> 00:24:05.780
directly innervated, OK?

00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:08.480
So the hormones that are
released by the posterior

00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:12.450
pituitary are actually
coming out of those neurons.

00:24:12.450 --> 00:24:16.040
And the cell bodies
of those neurons

00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:18.750
are up in the hypothalamus.

00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:21.430
So a couple examples.

00:24:21.430 --> 00:24:22.770
Let's go through the examples.

00:24:22.770 --> 00:24:25.260
You absolutely do not
need to memorize this.

00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:27.550
We only did this because
Will teaches MCAT,

00:24:27.550 --> 00:24:30.100
and those kids really
like their acronyms.

00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:34.220
They like things that you can
say out and put around and put

00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:34.940
them in bold.

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:39.680
So FLAT PEG is the
acronym that people

00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:42.420
use when they want to
memorize a lot of stuff

00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:44.870
to memorize the posterior--
or sorry, the anterior

00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:47.540
pituitary hormones.

00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:49.790
Some that will be
relevant to us that you

00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:55.720
might want to keep in mind
are, particularly, ACTH.

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:58.160
Don't worry about it quite
yet, but just kind of plug it

00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:01.204
in your mind to something cool.

00:25:01.204 --> 00:25:03.120
And a couple of these
other ones might come up

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:05.740
as well, but whatever.

00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:08.650
On the posterior
side, we were upset

00:25:08.650 --> 00:25:11.240
because there was
no cool acronym--

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:13.103
is that the right word, acronym?

00:25:13.103 --> 00:25:13.790
Yeah.

00:25:13.790 --> 00:25:18.485
For the vassopressin
and oxytocin.

00:25:18.485 --> 00:25:20.860
And we decided that since
these are the two hormones that

00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:23.680
are always being shouted
out in these vole studies,

00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:25.430
we put some voles on there.

00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:26.680
And we thought they were cute.

00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:31.120
They've kind of got some Rudolph
things going on with the noses.

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:34.420
So yeah, whenever you're hearing
about vasopressin and oxytocin,

00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:36.580
those are hormones
that are released

00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:40.710
from the neurons in-- that
go from the hypothalamus

00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:42.740
to the posterior pituitary.

00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:44.520
Now, questions
about any of that?

00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:46.170
That's kind of
some neuroanatomy.

00:25:46.170 --> 00:25:48.170
You're probably not super
excited and interested

00:25:48.170 --> 00:25:48.930
in about that.

00:25:48.930 --> 00:25:51.490
But it's useful to know.

00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:52.960
It might come up a little bit.

00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:54.080
So, questions?

00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:55.980
Clarifications?

00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:56.760
None at all.

00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:57.560
Oh, there's one.

00:25:57.560 --> 00:25:58.140
Oh.

00:25:58.140 --> 00:25:59.016
Yes.

00:25:59.016 --> 00:26:05.960
So I guess the
neurotransmitters [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:07.448
or are they released
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:12.970
Oh, my, that's a great question.

00:26:12.970 --> 00:26:15.780
So I don't know how much
we got into kind of--

00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:16.270
Why don't you
repeat the question.

00:26:16.270 --> 00:26:16.770
Oh, sorry.

00:26:16.770 --> 00:26:21.490
The question was the
neurotransmitter slash hormones

00:26:21.490 --> 00:26:24.970
like vasopressin
and oxytocin that

00:26:24.970 --> 00:26:27.419
are released in the
posterior pituitary,

00:26:27.419 --> 00:26:29.460
are those just kind of
like sitting there waiting

00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:32.980
to be released, or do those
have to be manufactured and then

00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:33.650
sent over there.

00:26:33.650 --> 00:26:35.030
Is that the question?

00:26:35.030 --> 00:26:35.530
Yeah.

00:26:35.530 --> 00:26:37.655
Or, like, if they're released
from the [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:43.060
Are they released when needed,
or are they, like, created

00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:44.480
and then sort of sit there--

00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:45.140
OK, so yeah.

00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:48.730
I would think about this based
on your typical understanding

00:26:48.730 --> 00:26:53.600
of a neuron, which just has a
cell body, an axon, and then

00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:56.740
the axon terminal, which
is where it releases

00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:58.190
neurotransmitter, right?

00:26:58.190 --> 00:27:01.290
In that axon terminal where
it releases neurotransmitter,

00:27:01.290 --> 00:27:04.130
it's got vesicles.

00:27:04.130 --> 00:27:07.780
It's basically got these giant
balls full of neurotransmitter.

00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:08.520
Same thing here.

00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:10.870
You've got these giant
balls full of oxytocin

00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:13.586
and vasopressin just
waiting to be released.

00:27:13.586 --> 00:27:16.070
But aren't those made
in the hypothalamus?

00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:19.780
Those-- like any other
neuron, those are synthesized,

00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:23.210
produced in the cell body
of that neuron, which

00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:25.319
exists in the hypothalamus.

00:27:25.319 --> 00:27:27.110
And if you're interested
in how that works,

00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:29.110
you've got to go on
this crazy journey

00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:31.230
where stuff--
proteins, whatever,

00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:33.690
made in the cell body of that
neuron, which you can see up

00:27:33.690 --> 00:27:36.640
there-- has to be carried
by these motor proteins

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:38.796
down the cytoskeleton.

00:27:38.796 --> 00:27:40.171
They walk like
this, I'm serious.

00:27:40.171 --> 00:27:42.880
I'm not making this up.

00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:45.780
And they have to walk all
the way down the cytoskeleton

00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:49.050
to get there so that they can
just wait for the right signal.

00:27:49.050 --> 00:27:51.180
That's an excellent
question, also getting

00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:53.200
at a deeper issue,
which is what is it that

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:55.190
leads to this hormone release.

00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:59.080
And we are gonna cover that in
our chapter three coming up.

00:27:59.080 --> 00:27:59.580
Yeah.

00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:00.080
Yeah.

00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:02.220
So yeah, clearly
there are neurons

00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:04.600
telling the hypothalamus
neurons when

00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:07.270
to be activated, when
to release vasopressin.

00:28:07.270 --> 00:28:10.196
Other questions about this
slide that's-- is anyone totally

00:28:10.196 --> 00:28:12.070
confused as to what it
is even talking about?

00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:13.296
Or you guys feel OK?

00:28:13.296 --> 00:28:16.130
You feel OK.

00:28:16.130 --> 00:28:16.740
All right.

00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:18.250
One last thing on
this one is I'd

00:28:18.250 --> 00:28:21.080
like to contrast it to
Dana's excellent talk

00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:26.390
on the autonomic nervous
system, where you guys learned

00:28:26.390 --> 00:28:28.720
a lot about a lot
of different things,

00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:33.230
including the fact that
the brain can control

00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:36.380
the autonomic nervous system.

00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:40.240
And the brain actually sends
neurons with their cell bodies

00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:42.760
in the hypothalamus and,
instead of sending them

00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:45.540
to the pituitary, it sends
them some other route

00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:47.740
down your spinal cord and out.

00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:51.280
And when we were talking about
the autonomic nervous system

00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:54.070
and it being also controlled
by the hypothalamus--

00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:55.950
this is just kind
of a reminder, OK?

00:28:55.950 --> 00:28:58.610
The brain and the hypothalamus
are really, really important

00:28:58.610 --> 00:29:01.040
for regulating a lot of things.

00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:04.690
In the case of endocrine
systems, this is how it works.

00:29:04.690 --> 00:29:05.190
Cool.

00:29:08.151 --> 00:29:08.650
Awesome.

00:29:08.650 --> 00:29:13.230
Now we're gonna look at just
one example, kind of zoom back

00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:15.020
out from the lady
with the ponytail

00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:17.270
to the dude with the
ovaries and the testes

00:29:17.270 --> 00:29:20.624
to remember kind of how
all this works together.

00:29:20.624 --> 00:29:22.790
And I could have done many
different systems, right,

00:29:22.790 --> 00:29:25.520
because we had all those
different peripheral organ--

00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:28.190
peripheral endocrine glands
that needed to leak juice out

00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:29.050
into the blood.

00:29:29.050 --> 00:29:32.650
I chose this one because it
comes up a lot in the class,

00:29:32.650 --> 00:29:34.920
and it's often referred to.

00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:40.480
So it'd be the hypothalamic
pituitary adrenal axis.

00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:44.460
The adrenal gland is one
of those several glands.

00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:47.500
It is regulated by
whatever hormones

00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:49.860
are in its environment.

00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:51.530
And whether that
hormone is there

00:29:51.530 --> 00:29:54.430
is thanks to the
pituitary and so forth.

00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:57.080
There's this kind
of cascade of events

00:29:57.080 --> 00:30:00.920
that allow the brain to
control a peripheral gland.

00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:05.220
And in terms of exactly
which hormones do that,

00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:08.140
we see that the
hypothalamus is gonna

00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:14.680
have to leak some CRH
into that portal vessel

00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:17.210
that we saw for the
anterior pituitary.

00:30:17.210 --> 00:30:19.160
So those neurons
on the upper left

00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:22.030
would leak, leak, leak some CRH.

00:30:22.030 --> 00:30:25.720
I might even choose not to
tell you what CRH stands for.

00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:27.930
And let's just say it's CRH.

00:30:27.930 --> 00:30:31.270
And then CRH travels
through that blood

00:30:31.270 --> 00:30:35.210
until it gets to those neurons
where it activates ACTH.

00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:41.670
It activates neurons--
or sorry, not neurons,

00:30:41.670 --> 00:30:46.950
it activates endocrine cells
to secrete ACTH into the blood.

00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:50.320
And then that travels through
the entire body's bloodstream.

00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:52.410
So it's gonna go
all over the place.

00:30:52.410 --> 00:30:54.060
But it just so
happens that the cells

00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:58.730
that really like to respond to
ACTH are in the adrenal gland.

00:30:58.730 --> 00:31:02.230
So the adrenal cortex,
it's kind of chilling right

00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:04.260
on top your kidneys,
having a good time.

00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:10.000
And when ACTH is present, it
will release glucocorticoids.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.920
And that's a big, scary word.

00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:15.180
It's a very important word,
because it's involved--

00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:17.100
this is the stress hormones.

00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:19.920
And for those of you guys who
have started reading zebras,

00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:23.430
you will have read a lot
about glucocorticoids already.

00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:25.970
They are gonna be a
really important hormone

00:31:25.970 --> 00:31:28.770
throughout the second
half of the class.

00:31:28.770 --> 00:31:32.450
So glucocorticoids,
stress hormones.

00:31:32.450 --> 00:31:35.854
One specific one that often gets
referenced is called cortisol.

00:31:35.854 --> 00:31:38.145
And we don't have to worry
about it too much right now,

00:31:38.145 --> 00:31:39.686
but just remember
stress hormones are

00:31:39.686 --> 00:31:41.240
getting pumped out.

00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:43.880
So we kind of understand these
first two positive arrows,

00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:44.960
I hope.

00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:47.170
Brain sends an arrow
to the pituitary

00:31:47.170 --> 00:31:48.730
sends an arrow to
this via hormones.

00:31:48.730 --> 00:31:51.960
Now when cortisol
comes out and it

00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:55.322
travels through the
systemic blood circulation,

00:31:55.322 --> 00:31:57.780
it's kind of knocking on all
the doors of every single cell

00:31:57.780 --> 00:32:00.160
in the body saying, like,
yo, yo, yo, I'm cortisol,

00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:01.780
I'm here to party.

00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:03.740
And if that cell
has a receptor--

00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:06.370
this is a theme coming
up-- then it will respond.

00:32:06.370 --> 00:32:06.990
OK?

00:32:06.990 --> 00:32:11.800
And some of the cells that
have receptors for cortisol

00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:16.290
are in the pituitary, and
some are in the hypothalamus.

00:32:16.290 --> 00:32:19.860
And what that allows for,
it allows the pituitary

00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:23.760
to know how much cortisol
is in the system.

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:26.470
So when it kind of realizes
oh my god, yay, the ACTH

00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:28.749
made it there and
cortisol came out,

00:32:28.749 --> 00:32:30.790
now that I hear the cortisol
is in the pituitary,

00:32:30.790 --> 00:32:31.860
I'm gonna stop.

00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:34.280
I'm going to slow
down on the ACTH

00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:36.380
and I'm gonna
relax a little bit.

00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:39.200
And that's something
called negative feedback.

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:42.160
Negative feedback, big term
in biology and all this stuff,

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:44.700
just means that
the more cortisol

00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:48.240
you get it to send
out, the less ACTH.

00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:50.150
It's kind of a
balancing mechanism.

00:32:50.150 --> 00:32:53.060
Brings us back to baseline
so that we stop secreting

00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:55.030
so much dang cortisol.

00:32:55.030 --> 00:32:57.250
Same thing exists,
there's a whole other area

00:32:57.250 --> 00:33:00.460
for negative feedback,
in the hypothalamus.

00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:03.280
And I think that, in the more
advanced endocrine lectures,

00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:06.360
we'll learn about another
site of negative feedback,

00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:09.000
OK, other parts of the brain
that, when they hear cortisol,

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.090
can slow this cascade down.

00:33:11.090 --> 00:33:13.750
So any questions about
negative feedback,

00:33:13.750 --> 00:33:16.040
what is the HPA
axis, why does it

00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:18.080
represent everything
we've been learning.

00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:20.592
OK.

00:33:20.592 --> 00:33:21.300
OK, great.

00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:22.090
Thank you, Tom.

00:33:22.090 --> 00:33:25.726
So Tom pointed out my
least favorite slide

00:33:25.726 --> 00:33:26.550
of the day earlier.

00:33:26.550 --> 00:33:28.960
This happens to be
my favorite slide.

00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:30.500
This is one of
those slides where

00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:32.260
it looks like it's
fairly simple,

00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:35.684
but actually a lot of
thought went into this,

00:33:35.684 --> 00:33:37.350
so much so that we
probably spent, like,

00:33:37.350 --> 00:33:38.960
two hours with the
original slide,

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:41.950
scrapped that, and then about
an hour ago changed it to this.

00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:44.390
So here it is.

00:33:44.390 --> 00:33:45.800
Very important question.

00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:47.450
Stemming from the things
that Tom just talked about,

00:33:47.450 --> 00:33:49.680
this hormone being released
and feeding back to the brain,

00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:51.370
we're gonna investigate
that a lot more closely now.

00:33:51.370 --> 00:33:53.740
We're gonna look at hormone
action on the brain.

00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:56.255
We're gonna talk a lot about
the hormone and receptors

00:33:56.255 --> 00:33:57.880
for hormones.

00:33:57.880 --> 00:33:59.600
We mentioned very
briefly earlier sort

00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:02.560
of a generic cellular response
to having a hormone bind

00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:06.820
to your receptor, either on
the surface or inside the cell.

00:34:06.820 --> 00:34:09.840
Now we're gonna talk about
specifically in the brain.

00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:14.900
So we have hormone to the
neuron, an epic journey.

00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:17.339
The reason this slide
took so much work is we

00:34:17.339 --> 00:34:20.340
were trying to come up with the
perfect analogy for a hormone

00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:22.120
returning to the brain.

00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:25.350
Something historically that
had to go on an epic journey

00:34:25.350 --> 00:34:28.710
to deliver a message where there
were sort of proper receptors

00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:30.500
to receive the message.

00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:33.170
So we thought about sort of
sticking with the Harry Potter

00:34:33.170 --> 00:34:37.350
theme and going with Kingsley
Shacklebolt's Patronus

00:34:37.350 --> 00:34:38.699
to Bill and Fleur's wedding.

00:34:38.699 --> 00:34:42.110
And Tom was a part of this.

00:34:42.110 --> 00:34:45.625
But I decided that
that didn't quite work.

00:34:45.625 --> 00:34:49.050
We thought about Phidippides,
the ancient Greek god who

00:34:49.050 --> 00:34:54.020
went from Marathon to Athens to
deliver the message that Greeks

00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:56.380
had defeated the Persians,
which was, like, the route--

00:34:56.380 --> 00:34:58.560
or why the marathon is 26 miles.

00:34:58.560 --> 00:34:59.650
Also didn't work.

00:34:59.650 --> 00:35:02.940
So we stumbled
upon this, which is

00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:06.160
a picture of Paul Revere,
the guy who supposedly

00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:08.810
said the British are coming.

00:35:08.810 --> 00:35:11.740
The reason this is such a good
example-- well, or at least

00:35:11.740 --> 00:35:13.570
we can stretch it
to fit here-- is

00:35:13.570 --> 00:35:16.600
that a hormone secreted
from an endocrine gland--

00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:19.540
let's say we're starting sort
of from a target organ here.

00:35:19.540 --> 00:35:21.960
And we-- Tom just
mentioned cortisol

00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:25.285
coming from this adrenal cortex
and going back to the brain.

00:35:25.285 --> 00:35:27.370
It has to travel sort
of through-- a hormone

00:35:27.370 --> 00:35:30.130
has to travel through
the bloodstream.

00:35:30.130 --> 00:35:31.724
Interestingly, in
order for cortisol

00:35:31.724 --> 00:35:33.140
to be secreted in
the first place,

00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:34.720
it received a signal, right.

00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:36.260
In this case, from ACTH.

00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:38.690
ACTH binding to receptors,
stimulating the release

00:35:38.690 --> 00:35:40.050
of cortisol.

00:35:40.050 --> 00:35:41.680
Paul Revere was
sitting out one night.

00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:45.140
This is the guy back in
1775-- actually a week ago

00:35:45.140 --> 00:35:49.220
today, and like 325 years
ago or something like that.

00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:51.530
1775, so that math
is probably way off.

00:35:51.530 --> 00:35:53.140
But you can figure it out.

00:35:53.140 --> 00:35:55.920
He was sitting outside waiting
to see these light beams.

00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:57.520
He was waiting to
receive a signal.

00:35:57.520 --> 00:36:01.060
And we can think of Paul Revere
as sort of a group of hormones

00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:02.040
here.

00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:04.690
And when the signal came
in, these two light beacons,

00:36:04.690 --> 00:36:07.780
he set off on this path
through the bloodstream-- him

00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:11.990
on horseback through the
roads-- with this message.

00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:14.470
And he didn't actually say
the British are coming.

00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:18.180
He said-- boy, what was it.

00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:20.860
Something like the normals.

00:36:20.860 --> 00:36:21.720
Something like that.

00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:24.340
I may have written it down.

00:36:24.340 --> 00:36:24.882
No, I didn't.

00:36:24.882 --> 00:36:25.381
OK.

00:36:25.381 --> 00:36:26.730
Well, he said some code word.

00:36:26.730 --> 00:36:30.440
And basically, this
code word, if there

00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:33.035
were proper receptors for
it, they knew how to respond.

00:36:33.035 --> 00:36:34.785
So it wasn't just the
British were coming,

00:36:34.785 --> 00:36:35.790
it was some other word.

00:36:35.790 --> 00:36:38.370
And if there were receptors
for it, they could respond.

00:36:38.370 --> 00:36:39.860
The relevance in this
case is we're talking

00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:41.110
about going back to the brain.

00:36:41.110 --> 00:36:43.060
So Paul Revere was
going to Lexington,

00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:46.180
sort of the central hub, this
central nervous system brain.

00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:48.250
We can sort of
stretch it that way.

00:36:48.250 --> 00:36:50.210
And has to find the
proper receptors there

00:36:50.210 --> 00:36:52.610
to initiate this
proper response.

00:36:52.610 --> 00:36:55.090
So I don't know, I
just like that analogy.

00:36:55.090 --> 00:36:59.080
So what we're gonna talk about
is hormone back to the neuron

00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:01.000
has to get through the
blood brain barrier.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:02.361
Those are the neurons.

00:37:02.361 --> 00:37:04.610
It's going through the neuron
or the group of neurons.

00:37:04.610 --> 00:37:06.380
Do they have the
proper receptors

00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:07.730
for this hormone signal.

00:37:07.730 --> 00:37:10.379
And once it binds, how
does it influence activity

00:37:10.379 --> 00:37:10.920
in the brain.

00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:12.760
What is going on there.

00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:13.980
Questions so far?

00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:16.770
Did I confuse
significantly with that?

00:37:16.770 --> 00:37:17.370
OK, cool.

00:37:17.370 --> 00:37:19.580
So we're gonna move on.

00:37:19.580 --> 00:37:24.464
Starting with the
blood brain barrier.

00:37:24.464 --> 00:37:25.630
So, the blood brain barrier.

00:37:25.630 --> 00:37:28.180
On the left, we have this
picture of just blood vessels

00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:29.180
in the brain.

00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:33.640
This is here because Tom sort
of has a personal mission.

00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:36.100
He and I both have been confused
about what the blood brain

00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:38.170
barrier is, what it looks like.

00:37:38.170 --> 00:37:40.000
He used to envision--
you can tell them.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.458
It's just really embarrassing,
so I'd rather say it myself.

00:37:42.458 --> 00:37:45.564
I used to think that, like, the
brain was in this barrier that

00:37:45.564 --> 00:37:47.730
protected it from, like,
the evil blood supply, when

00:37:47.730 --> 00:37:50.190
it obviously can't be like
that because the blood has

00:37:50.190 --> 00:37:53.360
to get inside the brain
and tell every single cell

00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:54.920
in the brain what to do.

00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:57.894
And I'm confessing
this to you today

00:37:57.894 --> 00:38:00.060
that you actually have to
picture the blood vessels'

00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:02.770
access to the brain in a
much more complicated way.

00:38:02.770 --> 00:38:05.240
So the barrier itself is much
more complicated, as well.

00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:05.740
Right.

00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:07.810
So the barrier is
constructed by basically

00:38:07.810 --> 00:38:10.610
these epithelial cells lining
the blood vessels, right.

00:38:10.610 --> 00:38:12.590
The blood vessels extend
throughout the brain.

00:38:12.590 --> 00:38:14.006
Just sort of an
image of it there.

00:38:14.006 --> 00:38:15.950
And we have this
blood brain barrier

00:38:15.950 --> 00:38:18.870
created by these tight
junctions in epithelial cells.

00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:21.144
Sort of a bunch of details
that aren't necessarily

00:38:21.144 --> 00:38:21.810
super important.

00:38:21.810 --> 00:38:24.315
However, it's interesting
because this barrier,

00:38:24.315 --> 00:38:27.320
this blood brain barrier,
basically tightly

00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:30.112
regulates what type of things
can go inside and outside

00:38:30.112 --> 00:38:31.320
the bloodstream in the brain.

00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:33.595
It's very important that
we have a lot of control

00:38:33.595 --> 00:38:37.730
over what's going on in terms of
our blood supply in the brain.

00:38:37.730 --> 00:38:39.690
So hormones, the
question comes up,

00:38:39.690 --> 00:38:41.950
can hormones pass through
the blood brain barrier.

00:38:41.950 --> 00:38:43.408
We did a bunch of
research on this,

00:38:43.408 --> 00:38:45.640
and basically because of
their epithelial cells,

00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:47.640
phospholipid
bilayer, same story,

00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:50.260
steroid hormones are lipophilic.

00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:52.400
They can pass
through this blood--

00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:53.615
this phospholipid bilayer.

00:38:53.615 --> 00:38:56.730
Not much of a problem there.

00:38:56.730 --> 00:38:59.110
Peptide hormones,
generally we know

00:38:59.110 --> 00:39:02.090
that they can't pass
through just on their own.

00:39:02.090 --> 00:39:03.735
But we looked this
up, there doesn't

00:39:03.735 --> 00:39:06.110
seem to really be a problem
with peptide hormones getting

00:39:06.110 --> 00:39:08.020
to the places they need
to get in the brain

00:39:08.020 --> 00:39:10.130
because they have these
carrier transports.

00:39:10.130 --> 00:39:12.630
They have the ability to get
through the blood brain barrier

00:39:12.630 --> 00:39:13.990
when they need to.

00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:15.880
So just sort of an
interesting point there.

00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:17.838
First step getting through
blood brain barrier,

00:39:17.838 --> 00:39:19.170
it's helpful to know it exists.

00:39:19.170 --> 00:39:21.040
It might come up in
other contexts later on.

00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:23.720
Things like alcohol, alcohol
can go right through the blood

00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:24.670
brain barrier.

00:39:24.670 --> 00:39:26.510
And that has certain
effects on behavior.

00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:29.289
We're gonna-- it might
come up later on.

00:39:29.289 --> 00:39:30.830
Here's this blood
brain barrier, what

00:39:30.830 --> 00:39:32.600
can get through it, what
can't, what does that mean,

00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:34.933
what are the implications for
that in terms of behavior.

00:39:34.933 --> 00:39:37.580
Something just to sort
of know about generally.

00:39:37.580 --> 00:39:39.840
So next step, receptors.

00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:42.990
So hormones, when they're
traveling back to the brain,

00:39:42.990 --> 00:39:46.070
there have to be appropriate
receptors for these hormones.

00:39:46.070 --> 00:39:49.530
Tom talked about cortisol, an
example of a glucocorticoid.

00:39:49.530 --> 00:39:51.900
Glucocorticoid is
a steroid hormone.

00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:54.650
This is an image of a rat brain,
and glucocorticoid receptors

00:39:54.650 --> 00:39:56.140
in the rat brain.

00:39:56.140 --> 00:39:59.960
We also have mineral corticoid
receptors, which we're not

00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:02.040
really gonna focus on, in blue.

00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:04.834
An example would be, like,
aldosterone for my MCAT,

00:40:04.834 --> 00:40:05.750
you know what that is.

00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:08.410
But we'll-- thanks
for the nod, Nate.

00:40:08.410 --> 00:40:10.030
But we're not gonna
focus on that.

00:40:10.030 --> 00:40:11.797
So glucocorticoid receptors.

00:40:11.797 --> 00:40:13.880
As you can see, there are
glucocorticoid receptors

00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:14.890
throughout the rat brain.

00:40:14.890 --> 00:40:16.710
Interestingly, however,
we see them sort of

00:40:16.710 --> 00:40:18.650
clumped in certain areas.

00:40:18.650 --> 00:40:19.850
What's going on there?

00:40:19.850 --> 00:40:21.710
This might suggest
a particular area

00:40:21.710 --> 00:40:25.750
that's particularly sensitive to
these glucocorticoid hormones.

00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:27.790
So these glucocorticoid
hormones come

00:40:27.790 --> 00:40:30.840
into the brain, diffuse
through the membrane,

00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:33.950
and bind to these receptors
located in the brain.

00:40:33.950 --> 00:40:38.255
We see here that one
area is the hypothalamus.

00:40:38.255 --> 00:40:41.160
Tom already mentioned
one effect of what's

00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:43.960
going on there, potentially
sort of these negative feedback

00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:44.790
mechanisms, right.

00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:47.389
Glucocorticoids coming back and
helping to regulate, or down

00:40:47.389 --> 00:40:49.430
regulate the release--
maybe I shouldn't say down

00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:52.770
regulate, but basically
suppress the release of CHR

00:40:52.770 --> 00:40:56.810
and, eventually, ACTH and other
things affecting cortisols

00:40:56.810 --> 00:40:57.990
released in the first place.

00:40:57.990 --> 00:41:01.060
We also see these receptors
clumped in the hippocampus

00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:01.986
here.

00:41:01.986 --> 00:41:05.800
So another interesting potential
other type of negative feedback

00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:06.970
thing going on there.

00:41:06.970 --> 00:41:07.690
Stay tuned.

00:41:07.690 --> 00:41:10.370
We may hear more
about this later on.

00:41:10.370 --> 00:41:12.960
Interesting point, though, is
that for every single hormone,

00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:15.362
we're gonna have unique
receptors throughout the body.

00:41:15.362 --> 00:41:17.070
But we're looking at
the brain right now.

00:41:17.070 --> 00:41:19.361
So we're gonna have unique
receptors for these hormones

00:41:19.361 --> 00:41:19.920
in the brain.

00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:21.670
We're gonna want to
be paying attention

00:41:21.670 --> 00:41:23.230
to when we're
looking at behaviors,

00:41:23.230 --> 00:41:25.540
we're gonna want to look--
we're gonna want to think about,

00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:27.410
basically, where are these
receptors in the brain, what

00:41:27.410 --> 00:41:29.770
types of receptors are
they, that sort of thing.

00:41:29.770 --> 00:41:31.280
On this slide, we
wrote receptors

00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:33.419
location, type, and how many.

00:41:33.419 --> 00:41:35.085
So I briefly just
talked about location,

00:41:35.085 --> 00:41:38.250
the location of receptors,
how that can matter.

00:41:38.250 --> 00:41:39.462
Type of receptors.

00:41:39.462 --> 00:41:40.920
You can have, within
an individual,

00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:43.600
you can have different
types of dopamine receptors,

00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:44.160
for example.

00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:46.243
You can have multiple
different types of receptors

00:41:46.243 --> 00:41:47.446
for a particular hormone.

00:41:47.446 --> 00:41:49.070
And this can lead to
different effects,

00:41:49.070 --> 00:41:50.470
depending on what type this is.

00:41:50.470 --> 00:41:53.780
We also heard about this on sort
of the population level, right.

00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:56.910
A variation in the type
of vasopressin receptor,

00:41:56.910 --> 00:41:59.950
and how that can lead to sort
of monogamous versus tournament

00:41:59.950 --> 00:42:01.824
species type behavior.

00:42:01.824 --> 00:42:03.240
I guess maybe stay
tuned for this,

00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:05.240
but we've also heard
about these things before.

00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:07.360
So types of receptors
are interesting,

00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:08.890
location of receptors.

00:42:08.890 --> 00:42:09.712
How many receptors.

00:42:09.712 --> 00:42:11.920
This is another question
that becomes very important.

00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:14.900
If we have a lot
of receptors, we

00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:16.320
can basically
predict that there's

00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:19.230
gonna be a higher sensitivity
to the hormone in that area.

00:42:19.230 --> 00:42:21.825
The low amount of
receptors, not as sensitive.

00:42:21.825 --> 00:42:23.200
When we look at
sort of-- when we

00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:26.320
talk about [INAUDIBLE]
rats, epigenetic mechanisms,

00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:29.850
this is supposed to
be basically affecting

00:42:29.850 --> 00:42:32.970
the expression of receptors
in certain parts of the brain.

00:42:32.970 --> 00:42:36.350
And then we can see the
behavioral impacts of that.

00:42:36.350 --> 00:42:40.795
So another thing briefly related
to how many receptors we have.

00:42:40.795 --> 00:42:42.600
We have the level
of hormone, and we

00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:44.074
have the level of receptor.

00:42:44.074 --> 00:42:45.490
And both of these
things basically

00:42:45.490 --> 00:42:49.200
impact the behavioral output.

00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:51.670
And the interesting effect
we can begin to see happening

00:42:51.670 --> 00:42:54.900
is that the level of
hormone can affect

00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:57.579
the up regulation or down
regulation of receptors.

00:42:57.579 --> 00:42:59.870
You might start out with a
certain amount of receptors.

00:42:59.870 --> 00:43:02.500
And then if you're flooded
with tons and tons of hormone,

00:43:02.500 --> 00:43:04.610
these receptors then might
start to down regulate.

00:43:04.610 --> 00:43:06.160
The cell might sort
of down regulate

00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:08.360
the amount of
receptors expressed

00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:11.970
on the surface of the cell, and
you might see down regulation.

00:43:11.970 --> 00:43:13.790
Conversely, we might
see up regulation

00:43:13.790 --> 00:43:16.020
if it's not receiving
enough of this hormone.

00:43:16.020 --> 00:43:18.290
Stay tuned for more of
this, complexity of this,

00:43:18.290 --> 00:43:20.300
complications with
this, et cetera.

00:43:20.300 --> 00:43:24.760
Any question so
far on this stuff?

00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:25.520
OK.

00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:26.140
Cool.

00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:29.270
So hormone action on the brain.

00:43:29.270 --> 00:43:32.300
Next we turn to basically
looking specifically

00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:32.910
at a neuron.

00:43:32.910 --> 00:43:35.760
As I mentioned before, we
talked about sort of the effects

00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:36.411
on cells.

00:43:36.411 --> 00:43:38.910
We talked about peptide hormones
and the secondary messenger

00:43:38.910 --> 00:43:39.780
cascades.

00:43:39.780 --> 00:43:42.080
We put the image back up,
talked about steroid hormones

00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:45.230
and generally affecting
transcription.

00:43:45.230 --> 00:43:47.160
Now we basically want
to zoom in on a neuron

00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:48.730
and see what types
of effects could

00:43:48.730 --> 00:43:51.290
be happening on these
cells, these brain cells.

00:43:51.290 --> 00:43:54.120
So we wrote down here, we
summarized it very nicely,

00:43:54.120 --> 00:43:57.140
potential effects of
hormones on neurons.

00:43:57.140 --> 00:43:59.740
Once the hormone
binds to a receptor,

00:43:59.740 --> 00:44:02.160
we can have it change
the membrane potential

00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:03.410
via ion channels.

00:44:03.410 --> 00:44:06.520
So maybe secondary
messenger cascade,

00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:10.321
if basically some
molecule of some sort

00:44:10.321 --> 00:44:12.070
bumps into another
channel, opens it more,

00:44:12.070 --> 00:44:14.320
now you've changed the
membrane potential in the cell.

00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:17.110
It either becomes easier or more
difficult to start an action

00:44:17.110 --> 00:44:19.850
potential, something like that.

00:44:19.850 --> 00:44:21.460
We can change
transcription of genes.

00:44:21.460 --> 00:44:23.960
So it can go in-- like we saw
this with the steroid hormone,

00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:26.300
going in and basically
binding to DNA,

00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:28.539
affecting
transcription of genes.

00:44:28.539 --> 00:44:30.580
In this case, the genes,
they could be receptors.

00:44:30.580 --> 00:44:32.020
This might be sort
of the mechanism

00:44:32.020 --> 00:44:33.520
for up regulation
or down regulation

00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:35.690
of receptors,
something like that.

00:44:35.690 --> 00:44:37.960
We can also have, of
course, change in protein

00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:39.130
activity in transport.

00:44:39.130 --> 00:44:41.910
This, of course,
is crucial, right?

00:44:41.910 --> 00:44:44.420
Proteins could be involved
with tons of things.

00:44:44.420 --> 00:44:46.910
Neurotransmission,
formation of new synapses,

00:44:46.910 --> 00:44:48.590
the things listed there.

00:44:48.590 --> 00:44:52.500
Basically, hormones
can have impacts on all

00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:53.700
of these different areas.

00:44:53.700 --> 00:44:57.310
Protein activity, transcription,
membrane potential,

00:44:57.310 --> 00:44:58.580
all these different things.

00:44:58.580 --> 00:45:00.820
And so at an individual
cellular level,

00:45:00.820 --> 00:45:03.070
we can begin to see sort of
the wider array of impacts

00:45:03.070 --> 00:45:05.209
on hormone binding,
what that can do.

00:45:05.209 --> 00:45:06.750
If you step back
and think about this

00:45:06.750 --> 00:45:09.710
as sort of networks of neurons,
not just individual neurons

00:45:09.710 --> 00:45:11.380
but networks of
neurons, now you can

00:45:11.380 --> 00:45:14.580
begin to see how hormones can
start to shape behaviors more

00:45:14.580 --> 00:45:17.490
overall, just these
networks of neurons, these--

00:45:17.490 --> 00:45:19.140
and those behavioral
outputs being

00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:20.720
sort of the output
of these networks.

00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:21.070
Yeah, question?

00:45:21.070 --> 00:45:22.501
When you talk about
impact on neurons,

00:45:22.501 --> 00:45:24.125
do you mean cells
that are in the brain

00:45:24.125 --> 00:45:26.125
and the central nervous
system, or are you

00:45:26.125 --> 00:45:27.560
just talking about the brain?

00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:28.060
Great.

00:45:28.060 --> 00:45:30.480
So question-- actually,
can you repeat that for me?

00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:33.105
Are we talking the whole central
nervous system, or just, like,

00:45:33.105 --> 00:45:33.957
just the brain?

00:45:33.957 --> 00:45:35.915
Whole central nervous
system or just the brain?

00:45:35.915 --> 00:45:36.415
Yeah.

00:45:36.415 --> 00:45:38.784
So in this case, I'm
talking about neurons

00:45:38.784 --> 00:45:39.700
that are in the brain.

00:45:39.700 --> 00:45:41.319
But these might
project anywhere.

00:45:41.319 --> 00:45:43.610
As Tom said earlier, neurons
can project to other areas

00:45:43.610 --> 00:45:45.026
within the brain,
can project down

00:45:45.026 --> 00:45:46.380
the spinal cord and elsewhere.

00:45:46.380 --> 00:45:48.469
So the impact could be
essentially anywhere

00:45:48.469 --> 00:45:50.010
that these neurons
could project when

00:45:50.010 --> 00:45:51.990
we're talking about the
effect of hormone input

00:45:51.990 --> 00:45:52.990
on neurons in the brain.

00:45:52.990 --> 00:45:57.080
The key is the neurons,
where they project,

00:45:57.080 --> 00:45:58.920
they'll have a certain
impact on-- they'll

00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:01.816
have some certain output
wherever they project to.

00:46:01.816 --> 00:46:03.190
But in the first
place, they have

00:46:03.190 --> 00:46:05.700
to have a receptor for
this hormone to bind.

00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:07.820
So it's just something
interesting to note.

00:46:07.820 --> 00:46:09.351
Other questions?

00:46:09.351 --> 00:46:10.430
I saw a question.

00:46:10.430 --> 00:46:11.000
OK.

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:11.880
Cool.

00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:13.120
Good, thanks.

00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:19.390
So I think that's-- kind of
summarizes my thing on that.

00:46:19.390 --> 00:46:21.280
Tom, did you have
anything to add to that?

00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:23.140
I'd say the more
interesting things

00:46:23.140 --> 00:46:25.560
that-- when we're talking about
neurons changing activity,

00:46:25.560 --> 00:46:27.810
neurons in the brain is where
the interesting stuff is

00:46:27.810 --> 00:46:29.100
happening.

00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:32.530
Maybe the lower doses reflex
has more of the, you know,

00:46:32.530 --> 00:46:34.620
how hormones might
influence how likely you

00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:38.560
are to your little back
arch raise, but who knows.

00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:40.040
OK, cool.

00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:43.550
So yeah, so we talked
about in the nervous system

00:46:43.550 --> 00:46:46.370
lectures how behavior is
affected by the nervous system.

00:46:46.370 --> 00:46:47.990
Now we've talked
about how hormones

00:46:47.990 --> 00:46:51.020
can affect the nervous system,
and therefore sort of affect

00:46:51.020 --> 00:46:53.360
behavior as an output there.

00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:55.380
We're gonna do a little
preview of some areas

00:46:55.380 --> 00:46:59.930
we might see hormones
interacting in future lectures.

00:46:59.930 --> 00:47:01.602
So, stress.

00:47:01.602 --> 00:47:03.810
We're definitely gonna see
glucocorticoids associated

00:47:03.810 --> 00:47:05.030
with stress response.

00:47:05.030 --> 00:47:09.550
Here's Harry and Sirius,
looking sort of stressed.

00:47:09.550 --> 00:47:10.860
Sexual behavior.

00:47:10.860 --> 00:47:13.100
Testosterone, estrogen,
vasopressin, oxytocin.

00:47:13.100 --> 00:47:16.050
We're gonna see these things
as players in sexual behavior

00:47:16.050 --> 00:47:17.330
lectures.

00:47:17.330 --> 00:47:18.120
Aggression.

00:47:18.120 --> 00:47:19.130
Testosterone again.

00:47:19.130 --> 00:47:21.820
Glucocorticoids,
estrogen, epinephrine.

00:47:21.820 --> 00:47:23.410
Depression.

00:47:23.410 --> 00:47:24.069
OK.

00:47:24.069 --> 00:47:25.610
There's something
about that picture.

00:47:25.610 --> 00:47:28.969
All right, depression.

00:47:28.969 --> 00:47:30.760
Glucocorticoids, thyroid
hormone, estrogen,

00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:33.820
progesterone, melatonin.

00:47:33.820 --> 00:47:34.320
Great.

00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:35.645
So some things [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:35.645 --> 00:47:37.145
Just something to
add for this slide

00:47:37.145 --> 00:47:39.311
is we're kind of throwing
a bunch of random hormones

00:47:39.311 --> 00:47:41.910
at you that you might
not be familiar with yet.

00:47:41.910 --> 00:47:44.210
Something to think about
is how every single thing

00:47:44.210 --> 00:47:48.190
we've told you thus far
regarding receptors and hormone

00:47:48.190 --> 00:47:52.564
levels and room for individual
variation and all these things,

00:47:52.564 --> 00:47:54.480
levels, where they are,
what type of receptors

00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:55.722
might influence these things.

00:47:55.722 --> 00:47:57.180
That's gonna be
kind of how we walk

00:47:57.180 --> 00:47:59.175
through a lot of
these behaviors.

00:47:59.175 --> 00:48:00.800
And then I think the
last slide is just

00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:04.149
take-home points, things that
are really excellent for you

00:48:04.149 --> 00:48:05.190
to try to walk away with.

00:48:05.190 --> 00:48:07.020
So don't walk away if
you don't understand

00:48:07.020 --> 00:48:08.910
most of these things.

00:48:08.910 --> 00:48:12.660
But steroid versus peptide
hormones and the importance

00:48:12.660 --> 00:48:16.150
of what it means
to be hydrophobic.

00:48:16.150 --> 00:48:18.100
Pretty much a lot
of the consequences

00:48:18.100 --> 00:48:20.570
for how we distinguish
between these two things

00:48:20.570 --> 00:48:23.090
depend on whether you're
hydrophobic or hydrophilic,

00:48:23.090 --> 00:48:24.650
so it makes it
pretty easy to logic

00:48:24.650 --> 00:48:27.560
through if you know
that basic thing.

00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:30.970
Whether you need the chaperone
or not, and what-- how,

00:48:30.970 --> 00:48:33.460
where your receptor
is going to be.

00:48:33.460 --> 00:48:36.650
The nervous system control
of hormone release.

00:48:36.650 --> 00:48:39.020
You guys-- I kind of hit
that into the ground.

00:48:39.020 --> 00:48:43.830
The HPA axis as one example
of how the brain could control

00:48:43.830 --> 00:48:46.480
peripheral or endocrine glands.

00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:49.120
And then finally, when
those hormones are released,

00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:51.940
how can they influence
behavior via neurons.

00:48:51.940 --> 00:48:55.640
Kind of the long trials and
tribulations of Paul Revere.

00:48:55.640 --> 00:48:57.885
A really excellent
analogy, I think.

00:48:57.885 --> 00:49:00.270
I think you guys
would all agree.

00:49:00.270 --> 00:49:02.354
And yeah, basically that's it.

00:49:02.354 --> 00:49:03.770
So if you guys
have any questions,

00:49:03.770 --> 00:49:06.360
you can shout them out, or
just come down here and ask us,

00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:08.840
because you guys have
fun things to do today.

00:49:08.840 --> 00:49:10.610
Thank you.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:07.959
Stanford University.

00:00:07.959 --> 00:00:09.000
Where have we got to now?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.330
You guys have all
the basics in hand

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:16.280
now for our next two buckets--
neurobiology and endocrinology.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.940
What you have now, I hope, is
a sense of especially the neuro

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.790
as the final common
funnel out of which

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.320
comes all that behavior
stuff we've been thinking

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.750
about-- genes-- whether they
are changing in a static

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.580
and then punctuated way
or a gradualist way.

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.760
What they code for we
now know are proteins.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.340
And in the realm of behavior,
what that's all about,

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.420
you now know, are enzymes that
make neurotransmitters, enzymes

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.660
that break them apart, receptors
for neurotransmitters, the ion

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.650
channels that allow all
the excitability stuff--

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.800
all of that should be a
way of conceptualizing

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.980
what all that gene stuff that
we've had so far funnels into.

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.040
Likewise with the
endocrinology-- all those ways

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.820
in which reproductive
status is going

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.770
to change how the
brain works, all

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.650
of those great evolutionary
models, blah, blah.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.990
That's now endocrinology.

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.140
That's now the
ability of hormones

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.000
to affect the nervous system.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.650
And what came
through, hopefully,

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.380
over and over for all of you in
the lectures over the last week

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.280
are two themes-- lots
of different ways

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.150
by which the nervous system
and the endocrine system

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.470
can change its
function over time.

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.890
And number two, lots
of different realms

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.710
where there will be
individual differences--

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.370
all the ways in
which you will have

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.217
a brain and a bunch
of glands that

00:01:40.217 --> 00:01:42.300
are different than the
person sitting next to you.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.260
And what you should be able
to piece apart readily by now

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.980
is where some of those
individual differences

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.650
are coming from in the
form of genetic influences,

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.380
where some of them are coming
from environmental ones,

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.970
to begin to take some
of those if/then clauses

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.770
back in the genetics lectures--
if it smells like a relative,

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.000
then cooperate with them--
to begin to imagine now

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.889
how the nervous system,
how hormones would actually

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:12.460
translate that stuff
into this next bucket.

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.560
So this will be our last bucket.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.294
Today we'll be looking
at all the ways

00:02:16.294 --> 00:02:18.210
in which everything you
heard in the last week

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:19.890
is vastly more complicated.

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.900
And on Friday what
we will do is focus

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.160
in on the part of the
nervous system that

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.280
is most pertinent to
rest of the course.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.680
Should you ever
happen by some chance

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.650
to stumble into medical school
somewhere down the line, when

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.720
they get around to the
nervous system there,

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.320
you are going to hear about
the spinal cord endlessly.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.670
You're going to hear
about the cerebellum.

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.050
You're going to hear
about parts of the cortex.

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:43.660
You are going to
hear next to nothing

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.190
about the part we'll be
talking to on Friday.

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.640
And what it's about is
emotion, and behavior,

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.130
and affect-- a part of the
brain called the limbic system.

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.510
In medical school, they
will pound into your head

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.420
over and over and over
how the spinal cord moves

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.710
different motor systems.

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:03.470
Because that's 99%
of what neurology

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.090
can concern itself with.

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.710
Because it at least has a
fighting chance of doing

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.570
something therapeutic there.

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.010
This is the part
of the brain that

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.840
is most defining to who we
are-- personality, temperament,

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:16.590
all of that.

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.620
And it will be central
to making sense

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.760
of all of this stuff coming in
the second half of the course.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.780
So it's going to be a
very different domain

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.680
of the nervous system.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.920
So what today is about
is taking everything

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.580
you've learned
over the last week,

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.520
and discovering that the ways
in which it is tragically

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.320
distortive and not quite right,
and comes with all of these

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.800
but wait-a-seconds and
qualifiers, and all

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.090
the ways in which this first
pass you had in the last week

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.290
sets you up now for
appreciating an enormously more

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.630
complicated system than
you've already seen,

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:53.730
one which generates, thus,
vastly more possibilities

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.850
of communication, of
information contained

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.820
within these neural
pathways, one which generates

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:04.150
vastly more possibilities
of individual differences

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.760
and of experience
leaving its imprint,

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.360
one that generates vastly
more possibilities for things

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.360
to go really wrong in the
realms of abnormal behavior.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.320
OK so a lot of
what we'll be doing

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.680
is taking what you
got in the last week

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.230
and seeing where, in fact,
current research shows that it

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:24.170
is much, much more complicated.

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:27.650
OK, first version--
one of the rules that

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.260
runs through all
of neurobiology--

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.400
you start learning the
field and at some point,

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.580
they pull out the
name of this guy Dale.

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.790
Dale who was the law giver.

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:39.200
Dale was some
neurobiologist early

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.380
in the 20th century
who generated two laws

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.600
that every single
child was forced

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.930
to learn throughout
the 1920s and 1930s

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:48.670
about how the nervous
system worked.

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:51.440
Some time later than
that, Dale's two laws--

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.440
and we will start
off with one of them.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.470
And it makes perfect sense
until you see that, in fact, it

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.310
has no basis in reality.

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.572
Here is Dale's first law,
which was you got your neuron--

00:05:02.572 --> 00:05:04.280
and you should know
by now we are dealing

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.090
with our schematic neuron.

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.390
And once we get into
circuits in more detail,

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:11.570
we will give up the diamond
shape on the neuron cell bodies

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:13.230
and switch over to
circles, showing

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:14.780
just how fast evolution can be.

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.580
But we've got the neuron here.

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.820
And what we've got are the
axon and the axon terminals.

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.556
And what Dale's law number
two-- and of course, it's

00:05:23.556 --> 00:05:25.930
irritating that we're doing
number two before number one,

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:29.660
but tough-- what you've got
here with Dale's law number

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:34.380
two is, each neuron has
one characteristic type

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:38.000
of neurotransmitter--
one and only one.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.520
And that's what it's releasing
from all of its axon terminals.

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.340
And thus, you could
categorize any given neuron

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.860
as this is one that
releases serotonin.

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.940
This one is one that releases
dopamine, et cetera, et cetera.

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.400
Notice that's a
world of difference

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.200
as to what types of
neurotransmitters

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.140
it has receptors for.

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:59.680
That's something else entirely.

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.630
That's what neurons over
there it's listening to.

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:05.920
But any given neuron is
releasing only one kind

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:07.730
of neurotransmitter.

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:10.010
So that one went down
the tube during the '80s

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:11.810
with the discovery,
in fact, that there

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:15.650
are multiple neurotransmitters
released by neurons.

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:19.000
And this was boggling to
people, and forced people

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.520
to give up on Dale number two.

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:25.340
And initially, this just seems
like pointless complication.

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:27.150
What you wind up
seeing is it puts

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:30.100
a lot more potential
for information

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:31.380
into the whole business here.

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:34.860
OK, so here we have our
archetypal synapse here,

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:36.670
going from left to
right as always.

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:39.770
And we've got the one on the
left here with its vesicles--

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:42.700
those little water balloons
filled with neurotransmitter.

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:44.720
Along comes the
action potential.

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.200
As a result, the vesicle
moves to the cell membrane,

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:51.670
merges with it, dumps the
neurotransmitter into there.

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:55.870
As you might guess, that
actual process of exocytosis,

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:59.160
dumping the neurotransmitter,
is vastly more complicated.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:00.760
But this is our general model.

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:05.250
And what people began to realize
was that all sorts of neurons,

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:07.880
all sorts of neurotransmitter
types, in fact,

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:11.880
came with two different
colors of neurotransmitters

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:14.770
in the vesicles-- came
with two different kinds.

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:19.400
Notice this is different
from in this axon terminal

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.880
you release this type
of neurotransmitter.

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:23.920
And in this one, you
release that type.

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:26.780
No, every single
axon terminal would

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:29.800
contain both of these
types of neurotransmitters.

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:33.090
And notice also, it
would not be one vesicle

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:36.310
was a blue neurotransmitter
vesicle and one was a red.

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:39.970
Each one of them had a
mixture of the two types.

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:42.600
What has been found
is that occurs in lots

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:43.870
of different types of neurons.

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:46.190
I believe the record
is that there are now

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:48.760
some vesicles that contain
three different types

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:50.320
of neurotransmitters.

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:53.240
So what we've got here
are two different classes

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:54.690
of messengers coming out.

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:57.080
And what you should be
able to immediately imagine

00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:59.900
is, that's going to
produce a lot more

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:02.020
potential for information.

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:03.870
Two different types
of messengers-- one

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:06.970
of the characteristics that
tends to be the pattern

00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:09.780
is that when you get
two neurotransmitters

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:12.750
in the same neuron,
the same axon

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:14.470
terminal and the
same vesicle, they

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:18.460
tend to be structurally very
different sorts of classes

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:19.940
of neurotransmitters.

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:24.150
One might be a type made from
a simple single amino acid.

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:26.880
Another one is somewhat
of a complicated protein.

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:29.560
They tend to have fairly
different structures.

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:31.590
And what that
often tells you is,

00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:34.559
they're going to have
different mechanisms of action.

00:08:34.559 --> 00:08:36.679
They're going to have
different speeds of action.

00:08:36.679 --> 00:08:39.200
What you wind up seeing
is very often, when

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:41.450
two different types
of neurotransmitters

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:44.120
are contained in the
neuron, one of them

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:46.820
works much more
rapidly than the other.

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:51.000
One has a rapid, short-term
effect-- quickly decrementing.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.250
The other will have
a longer effect.

00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:55.410
And by now, you can
begin to imagine

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:57.460
what counts as a longer effect.

00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:01.150
You change gene
transcription in that neuron.

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:03.540
You change structural
stuff happening,

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:05.920
as opposed to the short
one, where just suddenly

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:09.260
some little ionic
excitability change occurs

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:10.750
in a couple of milliseconds.

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:15.450
You begin to see this pattern of
two different ways of coding--

00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:18.240
coding for different
types of information.

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:22.490
What we'll see shortly is one
of the truly bizarre things that

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:26.730
pops up a lot with these cases
of multiple neurotransmitters.

00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:32.060
One of them will have receptors
for it on the neuron itself.

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:33.540
And we will focus
on that shortly.

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:36.740
That actually winds up making
a fair amount of sense.

00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:39.760
OK, so Dale trashed
in terms of the notion

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:42.740
of any given neuron having
only one neurotransmitter.

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:45.810
In some types of neurons
you have, instead, pairs,

00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:47.900
but following the
same sort of rules.

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:50.510
And thanks to the typical
structural difference

00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:52.420
between the pairs of
neurotransmitters,

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:55.450
you tend to get different
sorts of functions.

00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:58.780
You see a similar principle
over at the endocrine end

00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:03.310
of things-- a world of more than
one single messenger carrying

00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:06.420
the same message, or the
same source of information

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:08.060
carrying multiple messengers.

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:11.970
Where we see here is what by
now should be familiar as well,

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:13.760
here where you got
your pituitary,

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:15.940
and you got your
anterior pituitary,

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:17.540
which is always facing left.

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:22.110
And the anterior here, we have
the glandular cells releasing,

00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:24.770
as you saw the other day, ACTH.

00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:26.300
Lots of this lecture
is going to be

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:29.240
about the regulation of the
adrenal cortical system--

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:31.140
the glucocorticoid
system-- because it's

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:32.510
the best hormone on Earth.

00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:33.740
And I'm willing to prove it.

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:36.040
But what we have here
is ACTH coming out.

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:38.570
And you remember what you
had the other day, which

00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:40.920
is incorrectly named.

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:42.810
You've got CRH.

00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:47.140
That's that business about the
brain as an endocrine gland,

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:50.480
the brain releasing hormones
into this little portal

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:51.920
circulatory system.

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:55.000
And out comes its characteristic
pituitary hormone.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.790
So what you saw the
other day is CRH

00:10:57.790 --> 00:11:01.790
is the hormone, the
hypothalamic hormone

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:03.620
at the base of the
brain here that's

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:06.540
released into this local
circulatory system, which

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:09.530
stimulates these
cells to dump ACTH

00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:12.140
into the general circulation.

00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:14.110
And that's the pattern
you've gotten already

00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:16.580
of neuroendocrine axis.

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:20.900
The brain releases a hormone
into the local circulation,

00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:23.220
which stimulates the
pituitary to release

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:26.660
a typical hormone in response
to it, which then goes and does

00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:28.690
something rather
to a distant gland.

00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:30.250
You've got that one already.

00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:34.630
You have Follicle Stimulating
Hormone, releasing hormone

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:38.400
up here, which triggers Follicle
Stimulating Hormone, which then

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:41.490
goes does something or other to
your follicles or to your sperm

00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:43.570
if you don't have
follicles, and these sort

00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:45.190
of three-step cascades.

00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:47.800
What we see with
the CRH system here

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:50.240
is one example of
how you can also

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:53.040
have a version of
multiple messengers.

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:57.370
Turns out CRH is not the
only hormone coming out

00:11:57.370 --> 00:12:00.960
of the base of the hypothalamus
that could release ACTH

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:02.520
during stress.

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:06.110
And instead, you've got
a whole array of these.

00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:08.940
There are neurons in the
hypothalamus that instead

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:12.300
release vasopressin into
the circulation here,

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:16.370
others that release
oxytocin, others that release

00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:19.200
norepinephrine, others
that release epinephrine.

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:21.030
And collectively,
what they're doing

00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:24.460
is stimulating the
release of ACTH.

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:27.110
You have an entire
array of these.

00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:29.220
And a huge amount
of work in the '80s

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:31.000
went into sorting this out.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.360
And what's going on here-- what
you have are stress signatures.

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:37.620
Different types
of stressors will

00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:43.680
trigger different orchestrations
of these ACTH-releasing neurons

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:46.220
up there-- different
orchestrations as to which

00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:48.160
hormones bring it about.

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:52.900
And it will be things like low
blood pressure or hypotension

00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:56.330
will tend to trigger
CRH and vasopressin.

00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:58.930
Low blood sugar,
I think, was CRH

00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:00.830
and epinephrine
and norepinephrine.

00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:03.600
The whole point is that
you get a signature up

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:06.520
at the hypothalamic
level regulating

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:08.860
this release of ACTH.

00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:12.260
Why have all these
different ways of doing it?

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:15.110
Two advantages--
one is depending

00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:20.120
on which orchestration of these
you use, the shape of the ACTH

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:23.090
secretory curve
will be different.

00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:24.700
It's the same deal here.

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:27.670
You use two of these to
get a short, rapid effect,

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:28.900
a more prolonged one.

00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:31.460
Here, depending on
which mixture you have,

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:35.560
you will have a different
profile of ACTH secretion.

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:38.510
That's so you get
control on that level.

00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:42.830
The other thing is that
each one of these not only

00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:45.590
helps to release ACTH
from the pituitary.

00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:48.450
It does other stuff
down here as well,

00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:53.230
so that you get a way of coding
under this sort of stressor

00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:57.240
you want to release ACTH and do
something or other in addition.

00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:59.590
The way you bring it about
is getting these two.

00:13:59.590 --> 00:14:01.670
With some other
stressor, you want

00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:05.390
to secrete ACTH, and bring about
some additional step there.

00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:08.420
And you do it with these
three-- that sort of thing.

00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:12.290
So you get control over the
shape of the stress response,

00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:14.340
and to fine tune it there.

00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:17.940
So here we've got this
completely more complicated

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:22.240
picture of all these
different releasers of ACTH.

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:25.160
In addition, just to make
things even more complicated,

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:30.360
there are clearly
hormones coming in there

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:34.870
which, instead of releasing
ACTH from the pituitary,

00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:37.530
they inhibit its release.

00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:40.850
And they release their hormone
into the circulation also.

00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:45.390
And people have had evidence for
these corticotropin-inhibiting

00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:48.500
factors for decades and
decades and decades.

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:52.230
And people have had an amazingly
tough time trying to figure out

00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:54.020
what these things actually are.

00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:56.720
The best implicated
molecule so far

00:14:56.720 --> 00:15:01.830
is a peptide called Delta
Sleep Inducing Factor.

00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:04.320
Think about that--
you go to sleep.

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:07.080
And that's a very good
time for turning off

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:09.010
your stress response.

00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:11.880
So that making
wonderful sense there.

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:14.120
The main point for
our purposes is

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:16.060
you've got
bi-directional control.

00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:17.750
You've got a bunch
of hormones that

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:20.040
stimulate the release of ACTH.

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:22.570
You've got at least one
fairly well-implicated

00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:23.944
that inhibits the release.

00:15:23.944 --> 00:15:25.860
There is no way that
there's not a whole bunch

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:29.060
of other ones doing the
same sort of signature

00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:30.890
coding at the inhibitory end.

00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:34.760
And you've got different ways of
translating different stressors

00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:36.780
into different
endocrine profiles.

00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:39.100
And of course, what
that winds up meaning

00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:42.755
is you get stressed-- like
your big toe is telling you

00:15:42.755 --> 00:15:46.480
you just burned it-- and you
are going to have projections

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:48.850
to a different array
of these than if you

00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:51.860
were getting stressed, you
were thinking about mortality.

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:54.100
That's going to be having
a different projection

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:55.840
profile onto these neurons.

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:58.470
What that suggests
is a huge amount

00:15:58.470 --> 00:16:01.240
of coding information
going on in the brain

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:05.260
and the spinal cord producing
these different arrangements

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:08.760
of how you dump out ACTH
and the other hormones.

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:11.570
OK, so that as a
first complication

00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:14.360
in these various neural
and endocrine systems.

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:17.490
You can actually have multiple
neurotransmitters coming out

00:16:17.490 --> 00:16:18.590
of the same neuron.

00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:21.260
You can have an array
of different hormones

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:23.900
that bring about the
same general response,

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:27.430
but they differ in terms
of fine-tuning the system.

00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:30.040
Next elaboration--
one now having

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:33.070
to do with some spatial
characteristics of how

00:16:33.070 --> 00:16:34.470
these systems work.

00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:37.570
And here we have the
same exact neuron again.

00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:40.850
And now we deal with
Dale's law number one,

00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:45.580
which is you know by now you
get the depolarization here,

00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:47.480
sufficient to get
to the axon hillock.

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:49.170
You get your action potential.

00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:52.570
All hell breaks loose-- very
exciting ionic of events

00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:55.790
of excitation-- all
or none regenerating

00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:58.960
go shooting down the axon
to the axon terminals.

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:03.670
Dale's lawyer number one was you
get an action potential started

00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:06.630
here, and it is going
to result in the release

00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:11.050
of neurotransmitter from
every single axon terminal.

00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:14.910
So Dale's two laws-- an
action potential causes

00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:17.990
neurotransmitter to be
released from every single axon

00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:19.280
terminal of a neuron.

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:21.720
Dale's law number
two just trashed.

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:25.170
And it's going to be the same
neurotransmitter released

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:27.170
from every single axon terminal.

00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:30.170
And Dale's law number one
has held reasonably well,

00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:31.840
except for some work by a guy.

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:35.610
And this is one of these sort
of mad geniuses of neuroscience,

00:17:35.610 --> 00:17:38.850
a guy at MIT named
Jerry Lettvin.

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:40.740
What he did was, as
far as I can tell,

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:44.310
he just sat around in a dark,
sort of abandoned warehouse

00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:45.629
for decades on end.

00:17:45.629 --> 00:17:47.170
And about once every
decade, he would

00:17:47.170 --> 00:17:49.930
write a paper that would
transform neuroscience.

00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:52.280
And he actually was like this.

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:53.240
I met the guy once.

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:56.120
And it was one of the more
terrifying experiences I had.

00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:58.350
I was working in
a lab where I had

00:17:58.350 --> 00:18:02.110
to go get an oscilloscope from
someplace, and pick up one

00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:03.370
because ours was broken.

00:18:03.370 --> 00:18:05.290
And everybody agreed
the place to find

00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:07.670
it was in Jerry
Lettvin's warehouse

00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:10.590
that he lived in, because
he lived with oscilloscopes.

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:14.690
And going in there, and it
was basically pitch dark.

00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:18.790
And there was this
sweaty, Sydney Greenstreet

00:18:18.790 --> 00:18:22.780
kind of guy sitting there.

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:24.990
And he was in a ripped t-shirt.

00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:26.780
And he had been in
there for decades.

00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:29.550
And he was chain smoking
and sweating in there,

00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:31.680
because it was 150 degrees.

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:34.900
So he spent a large part of the
last part of the 20th century

00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:38.590
inside that warehouse
writing one paper per decade

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:39.850
that was transforming.

00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:41.880
So this was his
particular paper.

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:43.890
And I think this one
was from the '70s.

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:47.180
And what he showed was that
under some circumstances,

00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:49.770
with him lined up with his
hundreds of oscilloscopes

00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:53.700
proving this, you in fact had a
violation of Dale's law number

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:57.190
one, which was you
can get blockades here

00:18:57.190 --> 00:18:59.540
or there that would
stop the action

00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:02.040
potential from
propagating down some

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:05.820
of the branches of this
whole axonal treee--

00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:09.770
in other words, a whole
different domain of controlling

00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:11.340
the flow of information.

00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:13.820
More subtlety
there-- neurons could

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:16.600
regulate which of
their branches actually

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:18.290
were sending on the message.

00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:21.690
And remarkably little has been
learned in the years since then

00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:25.600
as to how this works, let alone
how common a phenomenon it is.

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:27.120
Most people wound
up ignoring it.

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:32.610
What has since been shown
also is the wave of excitation

00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:35.380
that could come in through
different dendritic spines

00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:39.210
back at the end-- that there are
ways in which branch points can

00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:43.620
be sort of blocked on one side
so that the flow is shunted

00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:46.360
in one direction on the
branches and not the other.

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:48.610
This is this whole
unexplored world

00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:52.380
suggesting there's all
sorts of regulation going on

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:53.860
at these branch points.

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:56.640
It's not simply the
case, action potential

00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:58.610
and you are going to
dump neurotransmitter

00:19:58.610 --> 00:20:00.610
from every single axon terminal.

00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:03.350
So down goes Dale
on that one as well.

00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:07.310
Equivalent over at
the endocrine end--

00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:10.650
and here we have our
pituitary, which now no longer

00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:12.270
has a brain connected to it.

00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:14.290
But you've got the
theme by now, which

00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:16.030
is you've got the
hypothalamic hormone

00:20:16.030 --> 00:20:17.800
and out comes the
pituitary hormone.

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:20.820
And there's a whole bunch of
different pituitary hormones

00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:27.220
producing the acronym flat
bread, peg leg, flat, flat peg.

00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:33.540
FLAT PEG-- go to your death
bed remembering that acronym,

00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:38.960
because it will make
you happy and fulfilled.

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:41.240
OK, so here's a bunch
of pituitary hormones,

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:45.030
and whatever verkakte acronym
these guys came up with.

00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:48.030
But what we have here,
just to make life simpler,

00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:51.990
is we'll focus in
on four of them.

00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:56.500
FLAT PEG-- so we're
missing some of them there.

00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:59.450
But we've got growth
hormone that comes out,

00:20:59.450 --> 00:21:02.800
prolactin ACTH, Follicle
Stimulating Hormone.

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:04.960
I'm picking these
completely randomly.

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:07.650
OK, in the simplest
possible of worlds,

00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:11.320
you would have all sorts of
secretory cells, glandular

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:12.630
cells, sitting in here.

00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:15.620
And each one of them
is capable of secreting

00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:18.920
all of those flat bread
hormones coming out of there.

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:20.460
It could be doing that.

00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:23.480
And it would simply be choosing
which as a result of which

00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:26.860
hypothalamic hormone is
coming down the pike there.

00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:28.200
That's not what you see.

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:32.350
Instead, you have specialized
cells within the pituitary.

00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:35.930
There's one type that only
secretes growth hormone, which

00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:40.850
causes somatic growth, somatic
body, somatic something

00:21:40.850 --> 00:21:41.350
or other.

00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:43.110
And those are
called somatotrophs,

00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:44.310
and don't memorize that.

00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:46.790
Ones that only
secrete prolactin,

00:21:46.790 --> 00:21:51.660
which cause lactation-- these
are lactotrophs, corticotrophs,

00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:53.250
gonadotrophs,
something or other.

00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:56.430
So all of these, in fact,
have specialized cells.

00:21:56.430 --> 00:21:58.650
Within the pituitary,
there are cells

00:21:58.650 --> 00:22:00.920
that specialize in
releasing only one

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:03.600
of these types of hormones.

00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:04.530
So you got into that.

00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:06.850
So what would be the next
simplest thing going on?

00:22:06.850 --> 00:22:10.560
So here's the growth hormone
releasing into the pituitary,

00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:13.510
and there is going to be
the ACTH releasing end.

00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:15.910
No, that's not what you see.

00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:20.780
Instead, there is a mosaic all
across the pituitary of all

00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:24.010
the different flat bread
cell-secreting types there,

00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:25.480
all throughout it.

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:27.490
OK, so that's just this mosaic.

00:22:27.490 --> 00:22:30.660
Good, somebody was sloppy at
the sort of fetal end gluing it

00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:32.940
all together, and just
scattered them all over.

00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:34.980
And what winds up
happening is you

00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:37.660
get local, little
neighborhood effects.

00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:40.910
For example, here
we have somatotrophs

00:22:40.910 --> 00:22:42.360
that secrete growth hormone.

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:47.040
And one is in a FSH
neighborhood and the other

00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:48.710
is in a prolactin neighborhood.

00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:52.550
And what you see is you throw in
the hypothalamic hormone, which

00:22:52.550 --> 00:22:54.820
causes growth hormone
to get secreted.

00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:57.530
And this particular
cell is going

00:22:57.530 --> 00:23:00.580
to be secreting totally
different amounts of growth

00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:02.810
hormone than this one will.

00:23:02.810 --> 00:23:05.800
Because it's in a different
sort of neighborhood.

00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:07.800
And what's the
implication of that?

00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:10.010
There's all sorts
of communication

00:23:10.010 --> 00:23:14.750
going on between the individual
cells in the pituitary.

00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:17.450
And it depends on what
sort of neighborhood

00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:19.620
each particular
cell is living in,

00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:23.080
how it is responding to the
hypothalamic signal coming

00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:25.950
down, wildly complicating.

00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:29.470
What that lets you do
instead is different areas

00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:33.760
of the hypothalamus will turf
its hormones to different parts

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:36.470
of the pituitary where
its particular cell

00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:38.760
targets will be living
in different sorts

00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:39.700
of neighborhoods.

00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:44.400
Simply more regulation, more
complexity going on there.

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:48.860
Next theme that comes through
in terms of elaboration--

00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:51.610
we all have the negative
feedback concept by now

00:23:51.610 --> 00:23:54.830
that came through throughout
the lectures last week.

00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:58.150
The whole notion
you get excited.

00:23:58.150 --> 00:24:01.020
You release a neurotransmitter
into your synapse

00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:02.230
if you're a neuron.

00:24:02.230 --> 00:24:04.240
You've got to do some
regulation there.

00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:06.390
You have to clean
up after yourself.

00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:09.390
You remove the neurotransmitter
from the synapse.

00:24:09.390 --> 00:24:11.430
You break down the
neurotransmitter.

00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:13.200
You have to finish
the whole thing.

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:14.930
You are the endocrine system.

00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:15.770
You are the brain.

00:24:15.770 --> 00:24:17.560
And you have gotten
it into your head

00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:22.130
that you want your adrenals
to secrete glucocorticoids.

00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:24.430
And you start that whole
cascade in which everywhere--

00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:27.710
and you need to know
when to stop secreting

00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:29.120
those hormones up on top.

00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:31.800
You need negative
feedback information.

00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:34.740
All of these biological
systems are characterized

00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:40.110
by that-- you have enzymes
where this enzyme turns this

00:24:40.110 --> 00:24:41.340
into this.

00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:43.760
And how does it know when
they should stop doing it?

00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:45.220
When there is so
much of this stuff

00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:48.530
building up that this
inhibits its activity.

00:24:48.530 --> 00:24:52.210
You get negative feedback,
feedback regulation.

00:24:52.210 --> 00:24:53.910
You're making a lot of x.

00:24:53.910 --> 00:24:56.950
And whatever is making it
has to be able to measure

00:24:56.950 --> 00:24:58.300
the levels of x.

00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:01.870
That is the simple rule of all
this negative feedback stuff.

00:25:01.870 --> 00:25:08.970
So a first example on the
neurobiological level-- so

00:25:08.970 --> 00:25:12.980
what we have are what are
called auto receptors.

00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:16.630
What I inferred before,
which is this weirdo world

00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:18.920
in which you not only
will have receptors

00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:21.570
for a neurotransmitter
exactly where they should

00:25:21.570 --> 00:25:24.250
be on the post-synaptic
neuron on the other side

00:25:24.250 --> 00:25:28.430
of the synapse, but you will
have them on the neuron that's

00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:30.390
releasing the neurotransmitter.

00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:31.970
It is an auto receptor.

00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:34.930
It is a receptor
right there on it.

00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:36.240
What's it doing?

00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:38.500
It's for bookkeeping.

00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:41.160
What you have is
some sort of rule.

00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:43.960
If the neurotransmitters
come pouring out of there,

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:46.930
and most of them go floating
across-- let's assume

00:25:46.930 --> 00:25:48.960
these are only red
neurotransmitters here,

00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:52.920
and bind to their
red receptors there,

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:54.770
and do their thing
to the next neuron.

00:25:54.770 --> 00:25:57.160
And just thanks to
the floating around,

00:25:57.160 --> 00:26:00.830
random life in the Brownian
synaptic sludge there,

00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:03.340
a certain number of them
are going to, instead, bind

00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:04.250
to this one.

00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:06.620
And all there has
to be is some sort

00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:09.950
of rule in this
pre-synaptic neuron

00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:12.520
that for every time
one of these hits here,

00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:15.410
it means I've
released 1,000 copies

00:26:15.410 --> 00:26:18.570
of this neurotransmitter,
or 1,000 molecules of that.

00:26:18.570 --> 00:26:21.810
And that's how I keep
track of the numbers.

00:26:21.810 --> 00:26:23.560
And I will have
a rule that if it

00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:25.780
gets below a certain
level of my picking

00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:28.120
up this bookkeeping
signal, that will

00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:30.670
be a signal to start
making more of the stuff.

00:26:30.670 --> 00:26:32.350
If I'm getting too
much of a signal,

00:26:32.350 --> 00:26:37.300
decrease the release-- feedback
regulation along those realms.

00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:40.470
This is where you see
one of the elaborations

00:26:40.470 --> 00:26:42.700
on this two-neurotransmitter
business.

00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:47.330
What you very often see is
one of the neurotransmitters

00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:52.000
will exclusively work on a
pre-synaptic auto-receptor.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.930
That one is stuck
in there merely

00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:57.140
in order to do the bookkeeping.

00:26:57.140 --> 00:26:59.320
You would think neurons
might have figured out

00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:01.090
a more direct way
of keeping track,

00:27:01.090 --> 00:27:03.010
like how many
vesicles they dump.

00:27:03.010 --> 00:27:05.000
But instead, this
theme is there is

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.790
some pre-synaptic
auto-receptor, which tells you

00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:13.460
on some statistical basis, every
time we get buzzed at this end,

00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:16.480
it means we buzz these
guys 100 zillion times.

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:20.260
And that's how we keep track
of how much we want to make--

00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:22.710
negative feedback loops there.

00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:26.010
You then see the
exact same equivalent

00:27:26.010 --> 00:27:30.101
in endocrine systems, which
is all this negative feedback

00:27:30.101 --> 00:27:30.600
stuff.

00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:32.520
Something that was
under-emphasized

00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:35.050
in the endocrine
lectures last week

00:27:35.050 --> 00:27:37.550
has been this element
of neuroendocrinology.

00:27:37.550 --> 00:27:39.540
What you mostly
heard about is what's

00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:41.710
going to be most
dominating in the classes

00:27:41.710 --> 00:27:44.870
to come, which is hormones
get into the brain

00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:48.900
and change how you think,
and feel, and behave,

00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:50.150
and all of that stuff.

00:27:50.150 --> 00:27:53.070
But also, some of the time what
hormones are doing in the brain

00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:55.510
is letting the brain know
how much hormones there

00:27:55.510 --> 00:27:57.190
were in the
circulation, in order

00:27:57.190 --> 00:28:01.170
to do the bookkeeping, the
negative feedback regulation.

00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:04.620
Your brain decides it wants
to have this much growth

00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:06.440
hormone in the bloodstream.

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:10.080
And thus, it releases
its hypothalamic hormone,

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:10.740
which goes.

00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:13.591
And all over, the pituitary
gets those somatotrophs

00:28:13.591 --> 00:28:15.840
to release growth hormone
and does its thing elsewhere

00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:16.520
in the body.

00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:18.480
And the brain has
to be measuring

00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:22.950
some consequence of that
growth hormone doing its thing,

00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:25.200
measuring up there, in
order to figure out,

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:27.790
have we gotten where
we want to yet?

00:28:27.790 --> 00:28:29.280
Same thing with prolactin.

00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:31.070
Same thing with
every one of those.

00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:34.420
You have to have negative
feedback regulation.

00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:36.670
So what do you need to
do to pull that off?

00:28:36.670 --> 00:28:39.060
You need to have a
part of the brain that

00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:43.930
is sensitive to that hormone
signal-- sensitive in some sort

00:28:43.930 --> 00:28:48.060
of quantitative way, where
it can, in effect, count

00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:51.060
how much of the stuff there
is in the bloodstream using

00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:53.060
the exact same sort of rule.

00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:56.200
If I've had one of those
hormones in the circulation

00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:58.890
come and bind to
one of my receptors,

00:28:58.890 --> 00:29:01.940
it means I have released
100 billion copies of it,

00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:04.080
thanks to my starting
this whole cascade.

00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:05.390
Did we want 100 billion?

00:29:05.390 --> 00:29:07.010
Did we want 107 billion?

00:29:07.010 --> 00:29:08.960
Do we want 93 billion?

00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:09.970
What do we do now?

00:29:09.970 --> 00:29:12.880
Does that tell us we've
completed what we want?

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:15.750
You get this negative
feedback signal there.

00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:17.240
So the first thing
you have to have

00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:21.130
is cells-- parts of the
brain-- that will measure,

00:29:21.130 --> 00:29:24.790
that will be responsive
to a hormone signal.

00:29:24.790 --> 00:29:28.800
Those cells have to be able
to have some kind of set point

00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:29.940
rule in there.

00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:32.620
This is the point of
life that I am at,

00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:34.460
the point of my menstrual cycle.

00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:37.110
This is the point of
reaching adolescence.

00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:39.410
This is the point of
am I stressed or not?

00:29:39.410 --> 00:29:40.530
This is the set point.

00:29:40.530 --> 00:29:42.560
This is the amount
of hormone I would

00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:44.520
like to have in
the bloodstream--

00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:46.550
this particular type of hormone.

00:29:46.550 --> 00:29:49.040
And what you need to
then be able to do

00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:53.500
is, if levels have not
reached that set point yet,

00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:57.790
you send a stimulatory
signal to the hypothalamus.

00:29:57.790 --> 00:29:59.650
Keep doing what you were doing.

00:29:59.650 --> 00:30:01.950
We need to push the
levels up higher.

00:30:01.950 --> 00:30:04.950
And if the levels reach
here or get even higher,

00:30:04.950 --> 00:30:09.130
you need to be able to turn this
into an inhibitory signal going

00:30:09.130 --> 00:30:10.900
to the hypothalamus.

00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:13.440
So what you see are
all sorts of regions

00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:17.260
of the brain that are sensitive
to these various hormones, not

00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:19.050
just in terms of
hormones affecting

00:30:19.050 --> 00:30:20.950
all the behaviors we're
going to hear about,

00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:25.840
but also negative feedback
regulation-- so a way now

00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:29.190
of showing just how much
more complicated it can be.

00:30:29.190 --> 00:30:31.560
So what would you assume
is the general rule?

00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:35.750
Here's an example of--
OK, let's make it simpler.

00:30:38.850 --> 00:30:40.530
OK, so what would
you expect to see?

00:30:40.530 --> 00:30:43.300
You're able to
measure CRH coming out

00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:44.920
of the base of the hypothalamus.

00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:48.660
And the deal is something
stressful occurs,

00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:50.900
and so it's pumping out CRH.

00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:54.530
And at some point, you've
got as much glucocorticoids

00:30:54.530 --> 00:30:56.150
in the blood stream
as the brain would

00:30:56.150 --> 00:30:57.860
like for that sort of stressor.

00:30:57.860 --> 00:30:59.540
And that leads to
the negative feedback

00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:01.260
signal, which stops
the hypothalamus

00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:02.720
from releasing CRH.

00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:05.960
What measuring is
the brain doing?

00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:08.260
Most obvious version
would be what

00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:12.720
the brain does is measure
how much glucocorticoids

00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:14.530
are in the bloodstream.

00:31:14.530 --> 00:31:17.240
And a simple rule, the
more glucocorticoids

00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:19.910
there are in the bloodstream,
the more likely levels

00:31:19.910 --> 00:31:22.750
are to have reached
the threshold, the set

00:31:22.750 --> 00:31:24.060
point, that you want.

00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:27.470
So the higher the levels, the
more of a negative feedback

00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:28.150
signal.

00:31:28.150 --> 00:31:31.760
And thus, the less
CRH being secreted.

00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:34.170
Totally straightforward,
logical,

00:31:34.170 --> 00:31:38.380
measuring the level of
hormone in the bloodstream.

00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:41.810
And this is how most endocrine
negative feedback works.

00:31:41.810 --> 00:31:43.680
Measuring how much
of the stuff--

00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:46.630
the more stuff there is,
the greater the likelihood

00:31:46.630 --> 00:31:48.340
that you shut down the system.

00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:50.270
You put in the negative
feedback signal.

00:31:50.270 --> 00:31:53.960
But in addition, there's
a whole other domain

00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:57.040
of glucocorticoid negative
feedback regulation,

00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:59.860
where in this domain,
what the brain

00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:03.550
is doing is not measuring
how much glucocorticoids

00:32:03.550 --> 00:32:06.470
there are in the
bloodstream, but measuring

00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:11.550
the rate of change-- the rate
at which levels are increasing.

00:32:11.550 --> 00:32:16.450
And that's a totally different
domain of information there.

00:32:16.450 --> 00:32:18.230
Now what you're
doing is measuring

00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:22.330
how many units of increase
per second are you getting.

00:32:22.330 --> 00:32:25.220
And what you've got is
this bizarre world there,

00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:29.220
where you go from 10
units of glucocorticoids

00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:32.820
in the bloodstream to
12 units in one minute.

00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:34.410
And that means the
same exact thing

00:32:34.410 --> 00:32:37.910
as going from a million
and 10 units to a million

00:32:37.910 --> 00:32:40.510
and 12 units in the
same length of time.

00:32:40.510 --> 00:32:42.760
It's not measuring
absolute levels.

00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:44.730
It's measuring rate of change.

00:32:44.730 --> 00:32:49.040
And the faster the rate of
change, the less likely CRH

00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:50.620
is to get secreted.

00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:53.990
And it turns out there are some
domains of stress responses

00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:55.920
where what the brain
is paying attention to

00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:58.730
is rate of change of
hormone in the bloodstream.

00:32:58.730 --> 00:33:01.360
There are other circumstances
where it's paying attention

00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:02.740
to absolute level.

00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:05.110
This tends to be what
the brain listens

00:33:05.110 --> 00:33:08.510
to very early on in
a stress response.

00:33:08.510 --> 00:33:10.790
This tends to be the
more delayed response.

00:33:10.790 --> 00:33:15.140
But totally different dynamics
there-- cells that measure

00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:18.060
the amount of
hormone-- that's not

00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:21.690
that hard to imagine-- number
of receptors, stuff like that.

00:33:21.690 --> 00:33:24.390
Cells that measure
the rate of change,

00:33:24.390 --> 00:33:27.220
where going from 10 to 12
is the exact same thing

00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:29.960
as going from a million
10 to a million 12.

00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:32.630
What is that wiring
going to be like?

00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:34.700
To this day, nobody has a clue.

00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:37.435
This was first sort of
figured out in the 1960s.

00:33:37.435 --> 00:33:40.130
An amazing scientist
up in UCSF named

00:33:40.130 --> 00:33:44.420
Mary Dallman who just sat and
out of sheer just modeling

00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:46.570
work in terms of
endocrine systems

00:33:46.570 --> 00:33:48.740
predicted with
glucocorticoids, there

00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:51.420
are going to be two different
domains of feedback.

00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:54.940
There is going to be a rapid
rate-of-change sensitive

00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:55.610
system.

00:33:55.610 --> 00:33:58.620
There is going to be a
delayed level of hormone

00:33:58.620 --> 00:33:59.930
in the bloodstream system.

00:33:59.930 --> 00:34:02.040
And here's exactly why
I'm predicting this.

00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:03.790
And she turned out to
be absolutely right.

00:34:03.790 --> 00:34:06.420
And decades later,
people still don't fully

00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:09.830
understand how a cell
measures the rate of change

00:34:09.830 --> 00:34:13.260
of something independent
of the absolute levels.

00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:15.210
One thing that makes
life a little bit easier

00:34:15.210 --> 00:34:18.199
is it's different parts
of the nervous system

00:34:18.199 --> 00:34:20.739
that do each type here.

00:34:20.739 --> 00:34:24.280
The very rapid rate-of-change
stuff, in fact,

00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:26.429
is not even occurring
at the brain.

00:34:26.429 --> 00:34:29.310
It's occurring at the
level of the pituitary.

00:34:29.310 --> 00:34:33.850
And thus, it's not so much
regulating CRH release,

00:34:33.850 --> 00:34:36.199
but ACTH release.

00:34:36.199 --> 00:34:39.330
OK, complicated-- the
main point of that

00:34:39.330 --> 00:34:42.659
is, even something
as logical as how

00:34:42.659 --> 00:34:45.020
do you keep your toilet
bowl sort of thing

00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:47.530
from overflowing the
tank in the back there?

00:34:47.530 --> 00:34:49.780
You need a negative
feedback signal.

00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:52.230
You need a way for
the toilet bowl tank

00:34:52.230 --> 00:34:55.360
to measure how much water there
is there, and the flotation

00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:59.390
device, and for that to have
a set point and a way of then

00:34:59.390 --> 00:35:02.880
transducing, reaching that
point into putting the lid

00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:06.230
on the top of the pipe
that's generating the water.

00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:09.190
Totally all these logical
negative feedback loop stuff,

00:35:09.190 --> 00:35:12.530
and then suddenly, in these
neuroendocrine systems,

00:35:12.530 --> 00:35:16.870
you get much, much more subtle,
complicated things going on.

00:35:16.870 --> 00:35:20.480
In some cases, you
have positive feedback.

00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:22.580
The more of a hormone
in the bloodstream,

00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:25.190
the more you stimulate
the system to do more.

00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:28.006
You get that at certain
points in reproduction--

00:35:28.006 --> 00:35:29.380
reproductive life
histories where

00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:32.760
you have massive changes
of estrogen, progesterone.

00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:35.550
And what you have will be
transient periods where

00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:37.210
you have positive feedback.

00:35:37.210 --> 00:35:41.070
All of these somehow have to
get translated into how cells

00:35:41.070 --> 00:35:43.560
are working-- very unclear.

00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:47.780
OK, so negative feedback-- the
next elaboration-- something

00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:50.810
going on at the receptor level.

00:35:50.810 --> 00:35:53.685
It's something known
as auto-regulation.

00:35:53.685 --> 00:35:55.980
And you could probably
begin to figure out what

00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:57.130
that one's about.

00:35:57.130 --> 00:35:59.690
And it will make perfect
sense as follows--

00:35:59.690 --> 00:36:02.580
if somebody screams
at you all the time,

00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:04.540
you stop listening to them.

00:36:04.540 --> 00:36:08.800
And what you have done is just
down-regulated your sensitivity

00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:10.830
to this pain-in-the-neck person.

00:36:10.830 --> 00:36:13.520
If they give a
very large signal,

00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:17.170
you down-regulate your
sensitivity to the signal.

00:36:17.170 --> 00:36:20.090
If a signal, instead,
becomes very weak,

00:36:20.090 --> 00:36:24.070
very often you will increase
the attention you pay to it.

00:36:24.070 --> 00:36:27.370
You are showing auto-regulation.

00:36:27.370 --> 00:36:30.010
Within the realm of
neuroendocrine stuff,

00:36:30.010 --> 00:36:33.800
you will be changing
the amount of receptor

00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:36.510
for a neurotransmitter
or hormone

00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:39.940
as a function of the
levels in the bloodstream.

00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:42.290
And thus, you have
this logic-- if you

00:36:42.290 --> 00:36:45.830
get a huge increase in
the levels of some hormone

00:36:45.830 --> 00:36:48.260
in the blood stream,
there will be a likelihood

00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:50.680
that various target
tissues will begin

00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:56.350
to down-regulate the number
of receptors for that hormone

00:36:56.350 --> 00:36:57.520
or neurotransmitter.

00:36:57.520 --> 00:37:00.250
Conversely, levels go way
down, they go right up.

00:37:00.250 --> 00:37:02.790
And this is a
general feature all

00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:05.500
these neural and
endocrine systems.

00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:07.050
Why is that interesting?

00:37:07.050 --> 00:37:11.170
When this regulatory,
auto-regulatory stuff

00:37:11.170 --> 00:37:12.860
screws up.

00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:15.440
In principle, it
should work perfectly.

00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:18.230
OK, for some reason,
there's a doubling

00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:19.880
of the hormone
message coming through

00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:22.270
in the bloodstream
under some circumstance

00:37:22.270 --> 00:37:24.290
where it's going
on for a long time.

00:37:24.290 --> 00:37:25.390
And that's not right.

00:37:25.390 --> 00:37:27.630
And somebody down at
some gland down there

00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:30.430
is messing up and drooling
out way too much hormone.

00:37:30.430 --> 00:37:31.610
So what are we going to do?

00:37:31.610 --> 00:37:33.290
We have no idea
what's up with them.

00:37:33.290 --> 00:37:35.490
But you've doubled
the level of hormone.

00:37:35.490 --> 00:37:37.830
Most folks down
there, OK, let's have

00:37:37.830 --> 00:37:40.180
an auto-regulatory response.

00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:42.570
Let's cut the number
of our receptors

00:37:42.570 --> 00:37:44.500
in half to compensate.

00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:47.190
You can see in a rough way
that's going to compensate.

00:37:47.190 --> 00:37:51.240
So massively increase the
signal thanks to some disease

00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:55.050
state, something weird going on,
and do a compensatory decrease.

00:37:55.050 --> 00:37:57.070
Have some disease
or abnormal state

00:37:57.070 --> 00:37:59.070
where levels of some
hormone or neurotransmitter

00:37:59.070 --> 00:38:01.220
go way down-- what do you do?

00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:05.140
Let's up the amount of receptor
enough to compensate for it.

00:38:05.140 --> 00:38:06.280
That's great.

00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:10.660
Where problems occur is if you
don't compensate quite enough,

00:38:10.660 --> 00:38:14.860
or if you overshoot, if you
begin to get a mismatch.

00:38:14.860 --> 00:38:17.260
And that's where
you've got problems.

00:38:17.260 --> 00:38:20.400
We will see, as you read
in the [INAUDIBLE] book--

00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:23.560
with hopefully great detail--
the chapter on depression,

00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:26.650
that's probably a critical
thing that's happening.

00:38:26.650 --> 00:38:29.780
Because we'll see with
depression what's probably

00:38:29.780 --> 00:38:32.640
wrong are levels of a few
different neurotransmitters--

00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:35.370
serotonin, dopamine,
norepinephrine.

00:38:35.370 --> 00:38:37.240
All of this is
going to come soon.

00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:40.370
And all of the standard
anti-depressant drugs

00:38:40.370 --> 00:38:43.340
change the levels of
these neurotransmitters

00:38:43.340 --> 00:38:44.500
in the bloodstream.

00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:45.680
And that's great.

00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:48.250
And we know just how it
works, except there's always

00:38:48.250 --> 00:38:50.080
a problem making sense of that.

00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:54.114
Which is you throw in some of
these standard drugs-- SSRIs,

00:38:54.114 --> 00:38:56.280
things of that sort-- don't
worry about the details.

00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:57.800
All of this will come later.

00:38:57.800 --> 00:39:00.950
The main point being that
these anti-depressant drugs,

00:39:00.950 --> 00:39:03.140
when you throw them
in, they're changing

00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:06.990
levels of neurotransmitters
within minutes to hours.

00:39:06.990 --> 00:39:09.730
You get somebody who
is deeply depressed.

00:39:09.730 --> 00:39:12.880
And you start them off
on an SSRI like Prozac.

00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:16.310
And they don't start feeling
better for days to weeks.

00:39:16.310 --> 00:39:20.000
There is some sort of
lag time going on there.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:21.990
And as people have
sorted it out,

00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:24.670
what the common sort
of conclusion is,

00:39:24.670 --> 00:39:26.870
these drugs are
not working so much

00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:29.830
by changing the levels of
these neurotransmitters.

00:39:29.830 --> 00:39:33.580
What they're really doing
is by changing the levels,

00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:37.640
they are eventually going to
cause an auto-regulatory change

00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:39.540
in the number of receptors.

00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:41.990
And these change within
minutes to hours.

00:39:41.990 --> 00:39:44.100
These change within
days to weeks.

00:39:44.100 --> 00:39:47.070
And that's what these
drugs are probably doing.

00:39:47.070 --> 00:39:48.230
We will go through that.

00:39:48.230 --> 00:39:51.602
Just to give you a sense of
how awful it is going to get,

00:39:51.602 --> 00:39:53.310
there are some reasons
to think that some

00:39:53.310 --> 00:39:55.710
of these anti-depressant
drugs work

00:39:55.710 --> 00:39:58.600
not by changing the level so
much of this neurotransmitter,

00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:00.550
or not so much
secondarily causing

00:40:00.550 --> 00:40:03.410
an auto-regulatory
change here, but instead,

00:40:03.410 --> 00:40:08.300
causing an auto-regulatory
change in these auto-receptors.

00:40:08.300 --> 00:40:09.980
Unbelievably complicated.

00:40:09.980 --> 00:40:10.920
We will come to that.

00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:13.360
For our purposes
right now, what that

00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:16.220
begins to tell you
is that certainly,

00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:18.960
the amount of hormone and the
amount of neurotransmitter

00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:19.930
makes a difference.

00:40:19.930 --> 00:40:21.980
The amount of receptor, as well.

00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:24.310
And have big
pathological changes

00:40:24.310 --> 00:40:26.130
in the levels of the messengers.

00:40:26.130 --> 00:40:30.640
The body attempts to regulate
with auto-regulatory changes.

00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:32.760
And a lot of what
disease is about

00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:35.740
is overshooting
or undershooting.

00:40:35.740 --> 00:40:38.270
So that's one realm within
the nervous system--

00:40:38.270 --> 00:40:40.236
neurotransmitters--
pertinent to depression.

00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:45.980
OK within endocrine
systems, an equivalent one

00:40:45.980 --> 00:40:47.760
is as follows--
something that you

00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:51.150
see that goes wrong in
diabetes-- adult-onset

00:40:51.150 --> 00:40:52.650
diabetes.

00:40:52.650 --> 00:40:55.640
One of the things you have
is a number of ways things

00:40:55.640 --> 00:40:56.430
can go wrong.

00:40:56.430 --> 00:40:58.910
But what your body
does is, when there's

00:40:58.910 --> 00:41:01.180
glucose in the bloodstream,
when you've just

00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:03.410
had a meal, when you
have all these nutrients

00:41:03.410 --> 00:41:05.450
in the bloodstream,
your pancreas

00:41:05.450 --> 00:41:08.150
can detect the levels of
glucose in your bloodstream

00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:10.390
and secretes insulin.

00:41:10.390 --> 00:41:12.610
Sugar shows up in the
bloodstream-- glucose.

00:41:12.610 --> 00:41:13.790
You secrete insulin.

00:41:13.790 --> 00:41:16.890
And what insulin does
is tell your fat cells

00:41:16.890 --> 00:41:19.790
to absorb the sugar
and store it away.

00:41:19.790 --> 00:41:22.960
Great, but you've
got a problem, which

00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:26.260
is that your fat cells
are already full.

00:41:26.260 --> 00:41:29.020
Because you are a typical
Westernized human,

00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:30.780
and you've been
eating to excess.

00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:34.290
And what you have is fat
cells that are full up.

00:41:34.290 --> 00:41:37.550
And they stop listening
to insulin, because they

00:41:37.550 --> 00:41:38.620
can't take it anymore.

00:41:38.620 --> 00:41:41.900
Because they can't take up any
more stuff and store it away.

00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:45.690
The cells begin to
be insulin resistant.

00:41:45.690 --> 00:41:48.020
And we'll see in a
minute how that works.

00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:50.630
So suddenly, you
have fat cells that

00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:52.390
aren't responding to insulin.

00:41:52.390 --> 00:41:55.724
And what happens is your
pancreas says, this is crazy.

00:41:55.724 --> 00:41:58.140
We're trying to get rid of the
sugar from the bloodstream.

00:41:58.140 --> 00:41:59.260
And it's not disappearing.

00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:01.250
The person just ate
eight Hershey bars,

00:42:01.250 --> 00:42:03.220
and their fat cells
are already full.

00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:05.890
But we're not clearing the
sugar out of the bloodstream.

00:42:05.890 --> 00:42:08.180
So let's secrete
even more insulin.

00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:10.190
And let's secrete
even more insulin.

00:42:10.190 --> 00:42:12.880
And what happens at the
fat cells, they say,

00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:14.520
this is ridiculous.

00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:15.460
We're full up.

00:42:15.460 --> 00:42:16.120
Forget it.

00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:19.000
We're not taking up any more
of these nutrient things.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:20.950
And in fact, what
we're going to do is,

00:42:20.950 --> 00:42:23.600
we're going to decrease
the number of our insulin

00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:24.640
receptors.

00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:28.890
We're going to down-regulate
our number of insulin receptors.

00:42:28.890 --> 00:42:32.210
And the pancreas freaks out,
and secretes even more insulin

00:42:32.210 --> 00:42:33.030
as a result.

00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:34.800
And you down-regulate even more.

00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:38.280
And what you have is
this downward spiral.

00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:40.540
Because at some
point, your pancreas

00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:44.200
is working so hard to dump
these boatloads of insulin

00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:47.470
into the bloodstream that your
body's paying no attention to,

00:42:47.470 --> 00:42:50.430
that you burn out the
cells in your pancreas that

00:42:50.430 --> 00:42:51.560
make insulin.

00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:54.720
And now you've got yourself
a real serious problem.

00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:57.110
What's the key of
what's gone wrong here?

00:42:57.110 --> 00:43:00.010
Too much nutrients, and
thus too much insulin.

00:43:00.010 --> 00:43:02.037
And the fat cells
begin to say, we're

00:43:02.037 --> 00:43:03.120
not going to listen to it.

00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:04.780
And they down-regulate
receptors.

00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:07.510
More insulin, down-regulate,
down-regulate-- and this

00:43:07.510 --> 00:43:10.440
is at the core of what
goes wrong in diabetes.

00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:13.190
So we see these
auto-regulatory changes.

00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:15.230
And they can emerge slowly.

00:43:15.230 --> 00:43:17.850
They can help explain why
some of these drugs work.

00:43:17.850 --> 00:43:20.050
Almost certainly,
they help explain

00:43:20.050 --> 00:43:22.600
what's wrong in some of
these psychiatric diseases,

00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:24.110
metabolic diseases.

00:43:24.110 --> 00:43:25.630
What's the punchline there?

00:43:25.630 --> 00:43:28.920
Number one, the amount of
a messenger is important,

00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:31.770
but the sensitivity
to the messenger

00:43:31.770 --> 00:43:33.370
is at least as important.

00:43:33.370 --> 00:43:36.480
You have as much
capacity to regulate this

00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:38.890
as this in these
biological systems,

00:43:38.890 --> 00:43:40.640
and thus you have
as much potential

00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:43.900
for screwing up at
this end as screwing up

00:43:43.900 --> 00:43:45.440
with the amount of messenger.

00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:47.760
Yeah, did I see a
hand up someplace?

00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:48.722
Yes.

00:43:48.722 --> 00:43:55.080
[INAUDIBLE] but wouldn't
the SSRI example, then,

00:43:55.080 --> 00:43:58.380
be the opposite of what
you're saying [INAUDIBLE]?

00:43:58.380 --> 00:44:01.845
Because you'd expect
increasing neurotransmitters

00:44:01.845 --> 00:44:04.815
to eventually cause a
decrease in receptors.

00:44:04.815 --> 00:44:08.800
So you should see
that [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:10.800
Great, OK.

00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:12.680
Don't listen to
anything she just said,

00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:16.550
because she's just gotten to an
incredibly subtle, complicated

00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:18.470
point about how
this stuff works.

00:44:18.470 --> 00:44:21.850
Go and read, and memorize,
and recite to your roommates

00:44:21.850 --> 00:44:24.375
the section on the zebra
chapter about-- the section

00:44:24.375 --> 00:44:26.520
in zebras-- on
depression, looking

00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:29.930
at the paradoxical things
where, at the end of the day,

00:44:29.930 --> 00:44:33.710
people are not sure say, an
SSRI, a selective serotonin

00:44:33.710 --> 00:44:35.110
re-uptake inhibitor.

00:44:35.110 --> 00:44:38.400
What it does is it blocks
the re-uptake of serotonin.

00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:41.050
And thus, you wind up with more
serotonin in the bloodstream.

00:44:41.050 --> 00:44:42.560
Somebody feels less depressed.

00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:45.440
I bet their problem was they
didn't have enough serotonin.

00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:48.790
Work through the logic of all
this auto-regulatory stuff

00:44:48.790 --> 00:44:49.540
going on.

00:44:49.540 --> 00:44:52.010
And people still
are not positive

00:44:52.010 --> 00:44:55.750
if the problem with depression
is too little serotonin or too

00:44:55.750 --> 00:44:56.540
much.

00:44:56.540 --> 00:45:00.560
Because depending on whether
the auto-regulation partially

00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:04.030
compensates, completely,
whether it overshoots,

00:45:04.030 --> 00:45:06.340
and whether it's these
receptors or these,

00:45:06.340 --> 00:45:08.560
will completely determine
whether the problem

00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:12.320
is too much or too little of a
neurotransmitter-- incredibly

00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:15.190
complicated, exactly some
of the complexities there.

00:45:15.190 --> 00:45:17.350
And that is so
complicated, in fact,

00:45:17.350 --> 00:45:19.080
that it is essential
that everybody

00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:21.530
stand up now and go to the
bathroom for five minutes.

00:45:21.530 --> 00:45:25.970
OK, again, back from the
other [INAUDIBLE] day.

00:45:25.970 --> 00:45:28.280
Your pituitary is
releasing all sorts

00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:31.720
of different types of
hormones under the control

00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:34.050
of all sorts of different
types of hormones

00:45:34.050 --> 00:45:36.580
signaling from the brain.

00:45:36.580 --> 00:45:39.590
What you get is, the
pituitary is not just

00:45:39.590 --> 00:45:42.650
made up of one type of
cell that can secrete

00:45:42.650 --> 00:45:44.850
every single type of
hormone and response

00:45:44.850 --> 00:45:47.660
to each type there of
messenger from the brain.

00:45:47.660 --> 00:45:50.060
Instead, you've got
specialized cells.

00:45:50.060 --> 00:45:52.330
You've got types
of pituitary cells

00:45:52.330 --> 00:45:54.520
that only secrete
prolactin in response

00:45:54.520 --> 00:45:57.772
to what's happening there,
types that only secrete ACTH,

00:45:57.772 --> 00:46:01.920
or secrete luteinizing hormone,
follicle stimulating hormone,

00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:03.020
so on.

00:46:03.020 --> 00:46:05.470
OK, so they're
specialized cells.

00:46:05.470 --> 00:46:09.490
Rather than having one part
of the pituitary, which

00:46:09.490 --> 00:46:12.520
is the we're in charge of
secreting growth hormone

00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:15.940
neighborhood, and one part
that's the we do prolactin,

00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:18.660
and rather than it being
broken up like that,

00:46:18.660 --> 00:46:22.355
instead, it's just a mosaic of
all the different types that

00:46:22.355 --> 00:46:24.480
are scattered throughout there.

00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:28.330
So that would initially just
seem like sheer sloppiness.

00:46:28.330 --> 00:46:30.550
Embryology-- they didn't
quite get it together

00:46:30.550 --> 00:46:33.010
to have discrete neighborhoods,
that sort of thing.

00:46:33.010 --> 00:46:34.770
But it's just scattered there.

00:46:34.770 --> 00:46:37.060
What's interesting
about that is,

00:46:37.060 --> 00:46:42.370
you will see any given
cell in the pituitary

00:46:42.370 --> 00:46:46.070
will go about its
business, which

00:46:46.070 --> 00:46:49.960
is responding to its
specific hypothalamic signal

00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:54.290
by secreting whichever
hormone it specializes in.

00:46:54.290 --> 00:46:57.020
Every single cell in
the pituitary going

00:46:57.020 --> 00:47:00.660
about its business will be
a little bit more or less

00:47:00.660 --> 00:47:04.290
sensitive to its
hypothalamic signal,

00:47:04.290 --> 00:47:08.080
depending on what sort of
neighborhood it's living in,

00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:11.640
depending on which other
types of these cells

00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:13.290
it's surrounded by.

00:47:13.290 --> 00:47:17.340
So that you will
get, for example,

00:47:17.340 --> 00:47:19.830
FSH secreting cells,
when they tend

00:47:19.830 --> 00:47:23.960
to be in a GH
neighborhood, are far more

00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:25.920
responsive to their
signal than when

00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:28.670
they're in an ACTH
neighborhood or one that's

00:47:28.670 --> 00:47:30.580
a hodgepodge of any of these.

00:47:30.580 --> 00:47:32.080
I don't know what the rules are.

00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:34.620
But what you've got
there are increased

00:47:34.620 --> 00:47:37.840
ways for regulation of
the amount of secretion

00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:41.370
by determining which way
you, the hypothalamus,

00:47:41.370 --> 00:47:42.680
turf the signals.

00:47:42.680 --> 00:47:44.560
Are you aiming for these types?

00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:46.400
Or are you aiming
for these types?

00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:49.740
More regulation that
way-- how does that work?

00:47:49.740 --> 00:47:54.070
What it has to be is all sorts
of communication going on

00:47:54.070 --> 00:47:56.610
amongst the various
pituitary cells.

00:47:56.610 --> 00:47:59.810
So the pituitary is not
just sitting there passively

00:47:59.810 --> 00:48:02.580
responding to whatever the
hypothalamus is saying.

00:48:02.580 --> 00:48:06.190
Instead, there's all this local
regulatory stuff happening.

00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:11.570
One additional thing
that was asked-- so

00:48:11.570 --> 00:48:14.020
in this case, what
we go back to is

00:48:14.020 --> 00:48:17.630
that business of the
more glucocorticoids

00:48:17.630 --> 00:48:23.780
in the bloodstream in this
boring, level-sensitive domain

00:48:23.780 --> 00:48:26.140
of you're just measuring
how much of the stuff

00:48:26.140 --> 00:48:28.160
there is in the
bloodstream, you're

00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:30.790
measuring there--
some part of the brain

00:48:30.790 --> 00:48:33.070
is measuring the levels
of glucocorticoids.

00:48:33.070 --> 00:48:34.690
And the part is actually known.

00:48:34.690 --> 00:48:36.850
It's measuring there,
and it has its rule.

00:48:36.850 --> 00:48:39.310
Once glucocorticoid
levels get this high,

00:48:39.310 --> 00:48:44.360
I will send an an inhibitory
signal to those CRH neurons.

00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:48.390
And as a result, they'll
secrete less CRH.

00:48:48.390 --> 00:48:50.590
And that turns off
the stress response.

00:48:50.590 --> 00:48:53.010
The more glucocorticoids
in the bloodstream,

00:48:53.010 --> 00:48:54.940
the more of a negative
feedback signal.

00:48:54.940 --> 00:48:58.980
What the person brought up was
the very astute observation

00:48:58.980 --> 00:49:01.050
that wait, what about
all those other types

00:49:01.050 --> 00:49:03.320
up there-- oxytocin,
vasopressin, epinephrine?

00:49:03.320 --> 00:49:07.100
What that means is
there are sensors

00:49:07.100 --> 00:49:10.110
that are talking to each
one of those types there.

00:49:10.110 --> 00:49:11.830
And the brain at
any given point,

00:49:11.830 --> 00:49:13.780
depending on the
stressor, is saying,

00:49:13.780 --> 00:49:17.030
well, we want this
much CRH, and we

00:49:17.030 --> 00:49:19.850
want this much of vasopressin
and this much oxytocin.

00:49:19.850 --> 00:49:21.940
And we're going to
determine it all

00:49:21.940 --> 00:49:25.890
by measuring the level and the
shape of glucocorticoid levels

00:49:25.890 --> 00:49:28.670
in the bloodstream, so that
there's feedback going on--

00:49:28.670 --> 00:49:32.200
not just onto the CRH neurons,
but to all those other types

00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:36.810
of neurons as well-- incredibly
messy and complicated,

00:49:36.810 --> 00:49:39.240
nonetheless very elegant.

00:49:39.240 --> 00:49:42.260
Pushing on-- next
version of complications.

00:49:42.260 --> 00:49:44.830
Now what we've got
is another feature

00:49:44.830 --> 00:49:47.290
of how receptors go
about their business.

00:49:47.290 --> 00:49:50.740
This general principle
doesn't apply all the time.

00:49:50.740 --> 00:49:55.000
But in general, more of
a ligand for a receptor.

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.610
A ligand, for folks
not familiar with this,

00:49:57.610 --> 00:50:01.980
a neurotransmitter is a
ligand for a neurotransmitter

00:50:01.980 --> 00:50:02.920
receptor.

00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:06.100
A hormone is a ligand
for a hormone receptor.

00:50:06.100 --> 00:50:10.190
The ligand is whatever the
receptor normally binds.

00:50:10.190 --> 00:50:13.060
So this general-- not
universal, but general-- rule

00:50:13.060 --> 00:50:16.610
of the higher the ligand
levels, the more likely

00:50:16.610 --> 00:50:20.070
you are to trigger this
compensatory down-regulation

00:50:20.070 --> 00:50:21.800
to lower the
levels, all of that.

00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:25.430
Here's another level of
regulation that can go on.

00:50:25.430 --> 00:50:28.100
So you've got these receptors.

00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:31.140
They are complicated,
because their job

00:50:31.140 --> 00:50:36.910
is to bind their ligand and
to then do something or other.

00:50:36.910 --> 00:50:38.830
And the cell, as
a result, opens up

00:50:38.830 --> 00:50:42.330
some channel that allows
a change in excitability

00:50:42.330 --> 00:50:43.750
in the neuron,
that sort of thing.

00:50:43.750 --> 00:50:46.610
These receptors tend
to be very complicated.

00:50:46.610 --> 00:50:50.980
And what you wind up seeing is,
in lots of realms of receptors

00:50:50.980 --> 00:50:53.930
for different types of hormones,
neurotransmitters, et cetera,

00:50:53.930 --> 00:50:56.860
you actually have
the receptor made up

00:50:56.860 --> 00:50:59.570
of a number of
different proteins,

00:50:59.570 --> 00:51:02.510
of a complex of proteins.

00:51:02.510 --> 00:51:19.080
So that for example, here
we have a receptor that's

00:51:19.080 --> 00:51:25.650
binding a ligand that looks like
that, just like your premolars.

00:51:25.650 --> 00:51:27.920
And what you have
there is, it's got

00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:30.460
to come up with a complementary
shape and lock and key,

00:51:30.460 --> 00:51:31.680
blah, blah, all of that.

00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:34.690
And in this particular
case, this receptor complex

00:51:34.690 --> 00:51:37.520
is made up of three
different proteins that

00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:40.820
are needed to pull this off--
three different proteins, three

00:51:40.820 --> 00:51:43.150
different genes--
a receptor being

00:51:43.150 --> 00:51:45.810
coded for by multiple genes.

00:51:45.810 --> 00:51:49.120
When you get the more
fancy, complicated receptors

00:51:49.120 --> 00:51:54.270
they tend to be complexes of
more than one protein forming

00:51:54.270 --> 00:51:56.130
this pattern.

00:51:56.130 --> 00:51:58.830
So you've got multiple genes.

00:51:58.830 --> 00:51:59.762
That's interesting.

00:51:59.762 --> 00:52:01.720
And of course, we're off
and running with that.

00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:03.850
What that means,
then, is you've got

00:52:03.850 --> 00:52:06.840
the potential for
variation, different flavors

00:52:06.840 --> 00:52:09.370
of the different genes,
more different ways

00:52:09.370 --> 00:52:10.740
that this could appear.

00:52:10.740 --> 00:52:13.720
There's two different
variants on this gene.

00:52:13.720 --> 00:52:15.830
There's 17 on this one.

00:52:15.830 --> 00:52:18.320
And you just do the
combinatorial stuff.

00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:20.680
And thus, you've
got a huge number

00:52:20.680 --> 00:52:24.600
of ways of generating different
versions of that same receptor,

00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:27.800
which, of course, will work a
little bit better, or a little

00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:32.130
slower, or a little whatever--
variation like that.

00:52:32.130 --> 00:52:35.180
Next complexity that
you get with receptors--

00:52:35.180 --> 00:52:37.570
you can have a
receptor that's made up

00:52:37.570 --> 00:52:39.570
of three different proteins.

00:52:39.570 --> 00:52:43.040
And there's four
different genes that

00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:46.880
make proteins that
can help construct

00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:48.560
one of these receptors.

00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:54.520
So you can make a receptor out
of proteins 1, 2, 3, or 1, 2,

00:52:54.520 --> 00:52:57.640
4, or 1, 3, 4, or
off you go with that.

00:52:57.640 --> 00:53:01.370
Or you can make a receptor out
of three copies of number one,

00:53:01.370 --> 00:53:05.080
or two copies of number two
and one copy of number four.

00:53:05.080 --> 00:53:09.940
There's these possibilities of
all these different subunits

00:53:09.940 --> 00:53:13.660
being different--
variability that way.

00:53:13.660 --> 00:53:16.450
So another realm
of regulation is

00:53:16.450 --> 00:53:22.820
when cells change the
subunits on their receptors,

00:53:22.820 --> 00:53:27.570
when cells will cause,
say, degradation of-- OK,

00:53:27.570 --> 00:53:35.650
so here we've got this
three-protein receptor complex.

00:53:35.650 --> 00:53:37.250
And there's four
different proteins

00:53:37.250 --> 00:53:38.950
that potentially plug into it.

00:53:38.950 --> 00:53:41.920
And this version has one
copy of A, one copy of B,

00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:44.920
and one copy of C.
Something may happen

00:53:44.920 --> 00:53:49.720
which will cause the neuron
to degrade the copies of B

00:53:49.720 --> 00:53:53.390
and replace it with
D, or replace it

00:53:53.390 --> 00:53:57.670
with another copy of A, replace
all this combinatorial stuff,

00:53:57.670 --> 00:54:01.390
and thus change a little
bit how well the receptor is

00:54:01.390 --> 00:54:02.720
doing its job.

00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:06.470
And you see these subunit
changes all over the place.

00:54:06.470 --> 00:54:10.250
One domain, in terms of the
neurobiology neurotransmitter

00:54:10.250 --> 00:54:13.730
stuff-- aspects of
glutamate receptors--

00:54:13.730 --> 00:54:16.750
you guys heard something about
that the other day-- glutamate

00:54:16.750 --> 00:54:18.610
receptor's essential
for learning,

00:54:18.610 --> 00:54:21.940
very complicated receptors,
insanely complicated.

00:54:21.940 --> 00:54:24.530
Part of what learning
appears to be about

00:54:24.530 --> 00:54:27.400
is not only
increasing the number

00:54:27.400 --> 00:54:31.250
of copies of a certain
type of glutamate receptor,

00:54:31.250 --> 00:54:34.240
but changing the
subunit composition,

00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:37.990
and making for a more
responsive, more excitable

00:54:37.990 --> 00:54:41.010
version of that receptor.

00:54:41.010 --> 00:54:43.930
There's other realms with a
different type of receptor

00:54:43.930 --> 00:54:47.180
where, in fact, you've got
an abnormal subunit that's

00:54:47.180 --> 00:54:48.550
not supposed to be there.

00:54:48.550 --> 00:54:50.550
And as a result,
this now produces

00:54:50.550 --> 00:54:54.360
a cell that is prone
towards insanely high levels

00:54:54.360 --> 00:54:55.600
of excitation.

00:54:55.600 --> 00:54:58.850
This is a congenital reason
for causing epilepsy.

00:54:58.850 --> 00:55:02.180
This is one of the genetic
forms of epilepsy, where you've

00:55:02.180 --> 00:55:07.210
got the wrong subunit winding
up in another neurotransmitter

00:55:07.210 --> 00:55:08.190
and its receptor.

00:55:08.190 --> 00:55:12.760
All we're seeing here is lots
of room for more regulation

00:55:12.760 --> 00:55:16.880
here, mixing and matching,
changing the subunit stuff.

00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:20.540
That's how you begin to do
that critical principle.

00:55:20.540 --> 00:55:23.840
Remember, all the stuff
from the basic functioning,

00:55:23.840 --> 00:55:25.890
the flow of information
from the dendrites

00:55:25.890 --> 00:55:28.460
to the axon hillock--
what's that all about?

00:55:28.460 --> 00:55:31.950
No single dendritic input is
enough to trigger an action

00:55:31.950 --> 00:55:32.470
potential.

00:55:32.470 --> 00:55:35.180
Instead, you have to have enough
of them, enough summation,

00:55:35.180 --> 00:55:39.680
to reach the threshold that the
axon hillock has to initiate

00:55:39.680 --> 00:55:41.040
the action potential.

00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:44.090
And the threshold
could change over time.

00:55:44.090 --> 00:55:45.610
Translate that into this.

00:55:45.610 --> 00:55:49.970
What does it mean when an axon
hillock's threshold is changed?

00:55:49.970 --> 00:55:53.160
Those critical first channels
that open up-- you've

00:55:53.160 --> 00:55:55.690
changed the subunit composition.

00:55:55.690 --> 00:55:58.310
So that is a theme all
throughout this world

00:55:58.310 --> 00:56:02.540
of receptorology and channels
that open and close and stuff,

00:56:02.540 --> 00:56:06.720
where cells can change which
are the pieces that make it up,

00:56:06.720 --> 00:56:09.610
and change the
properties subtly.

00:56:09.610 --> 00:56:13.260
Similar theme that could
come through with hormone

00:56:13.260 --> 00:56:15.000
receptors-- same exact deal.

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:18.350
A whole bunch of them are
multi-protein complexes--

00:56:18.350 --> 00:56:20.330
exact same story.

00:56:20.330 --> 00:56:23.060
You can see something a
little different when you

00:56:23.060 --> 00:56:25.147
have steroid hormone receptors.

00:56:28.360 --> 00:56:30.650
And as we saw the
other week, remember,

00:56:30.650 --> 00:56:34.910
it's got two domains-- one
which binds the hormone--

00:56:34.910 --> 00:56:38.110
glucocorticoid, just to pick
a random steroid or estrogen,

00:56:38.110 --> 00:56:42.850
progesterone, or whatever-- and
one that binds to the promoter

00:56:42.850 --> 00:56:44.230
element in the DNA.

00:56:44.230 --> 00:56:46.020
We've got our if/then clause.

00:56:46.020 --> 00:56:49.460
If and only if this
steroid hormone shows up,

00:56:49.460 --> 00:56:52.890
then you go and you
activate that gene--

00:56:52.890 --> 00:56:54.030
our conditional clause.

00:56:54.030 --> 00:56:55.940
But what turns
out to be the case

00:56:55.940 --> 00:57:00.640
is all sorts of steroid
hormone receptors

00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:04.680
have various other proteins
that they bind there.

00:57:04.680 --> 00:57:07.660
Co-factors is the
term given for it.

00:57:07.660 --> 00:57:12.610
And you get different arrays
of co-factors in different cell

00:57:12.610 --> 00:57:13.510
types.

00:57:13.510 --> 00:57:16.630
And as a result, when
you activate this,

00:57:16.630 --> 00:57:19.470
it will do different things
in different cell types--

00:57:19.470 --> 00:57:21.690
cell-type specific coding.

00:57:21.690 --> 00:57:24.310
And of course, the
exact same theme

00:57:24.310 --> 00:57:27.190
here-- under some
circumstances, cells

00:57:27.190 --> 00:57:30.110
will change which
cofactors they have

00:57:30.110 --> 00:57:32.150
holding onto those receptors.

00:57:32.150 --> 00:57:35.380
So what we see here are
these additional layers

00:57:35.380 --> 00:57:38.350
of potential regulation.

00:57:38.350 --> 00:57:42.410
More complexities--
next one-- now

00:57:42.410 --> 00:57:45.260
we've hurdled past the
notion of only one type

00:57:45.260 --> 00:57:47.190
of neurotransmitter per neuron.

00:57:47.190 --> 00:57:50.530
We have hurdled past the
notion of the same action

00:57:50.530 --> 00:57:53.970
potential will be manifest in
every single axon terminal.

00:57:53.970 --> 00:57:57.160
Now we see all sorts of
additional information built

00:57:57.160 --> 00:58:00.190
around changing the
number of receptors,

00:58:00.190 --> 00:58:04.130
changing the composition of
them, regulating those ways.

00:58:04.130 --> 00:58:07.300
One additional complication
here with these receptors,

00:58:07.300 --> 00:58:11.910
which is a lot of them can
bind more than one thing,

00:58:11.910 --> 00:58:14.860
can bind more than one ligand.

00:58:14.860 --> 00:58:18.930
And we see an amazing example
of this at the neurotransmitter

00:58:18.930 --> 00:58:20.930
end of the world.

00:58:20.930 --> 00:58:23.410
You guys heard about the
neurotransmitter GABA.

00:58:23.410 --> 00:58:28.660
GABA is the main inhibitory
neurotransmitter in the brain.

00:58:28.660 --> 00:58:30.740
It is the workhorse
for doing that.

00:58:30.740 --> 00:58:35.400
The GABA receptor-- no
surprise-- binds GABA.

00:58:35.400 --> 00:58:37.210
Its ligand is GABA.

00:58:37.210 --> 00:58:39.710
It is found on the
dendritic spines

00:58:39.710 --> 00:58:42.920
of GABA-responsive neurons.

00:58:42.920 --> 00:58:44.720
And the neurons
just upstream of it

00:58:44.720 --> 00:58:48.560
will release GABA in response
to its action potential,

00:58:48.560 --> 00:58:50.020
and just goes about its thing.

00:58:50.020 --> 00:58:51.920
So what does the
GABA receptor do?

00:58:51.920 --> 00:58:53.050
It binds GABA.

00:58:53.050 --> 00:58:55.230
And when it binds GABA,
something or other

00:58:55.230 --> 00:58:59.590
happens so that this neuron
becomes less excitable.

00:58:59.590 --> 00:59:02.140
It's an inhibitory
neurotransmitter.

00:59:02.140 --> 00:59:06.550
It turns out the GABA receptor
is insanely complicated.

00:59:06.550 --> 00:59:09.180
It is, instead, a
receptor complex

00:59:09.180 --> 00:59:11.110
of a whole bunch of
different proteins.

00:59:11.110 --> 00:59:13.530
And what the GABA
receptor does is

00:59:13.530 --> 00:59:16.450
it binds some other
things as well--

00:59:16.450 --> 00:59:20.100
three different classes, all
of which are very interesting.

00:59:20.100 --> 00:59:23.570
The first class of additional
things that it binds

00:59:23.570 --> 00:59:27.980
are things called
major tranquilizers.

00:59:27.980 --> 00:59:30.510
What does the GABA complex bind?

00:59:30.510 --> 00:59:36.870
And here we have
our GABA receptor.

00:59:36.870 --> 00:59:38.550
And GABA fits right in there.

00:59:38.550 --> 00:59:40.960
And it turns out the
GABA receptor also

00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:45.810
has another binding site
here for major tranquilizers.

00:59:45.810 --> 00:59:47.650
What are major tranquilizers?

00:59:47.650 --> 00:59:52.970
Barbiturates-- this is how
barbiturates work in the brain.

00:59:52.970 --> 00:59:55.400
There are not
barbiturate receptors.

00:59:55.400 --> 00:59:57.860
They bind to the GABA receptor.

00:59:57.860 --> 01:00:00.310
There is a side complex on it.

01:00:00.310 --> 01:00:03.470
There is a minor binding
site on the GABA receptor

01:00:03.470 --> 01:00:05.470
for barbiturates.

01:00:05.470 --> 01:00:09.860
OK, so GABA, inhibitory
neurotransmitter-- when

01:00:09.860 --> 01:00:13.240
barbiturates are around, does
that increase or decrease

01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:14.000
GABA signaling?

01:00:17.260 --> 01:00:20.620
OK, who says increase?

01:00:20.620 --> 01:00:23.170
Who says decrease?

01:00:23.170 --> 01:00:24.910
Who says, what?

01:00:24.910 --> 01:00:27.030
OK, me, too.

01:00:27.030 --> 01:00:30.250
I wasn't listening either.

01:00:30.250 --> 01:00:32.130
I'll tell you, lurking
around in the back

01:00:32.130 --> 01:00:34.360
during those TA's
lectures, you really

01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:37.050
do get a sense of what
interesting, non-academic

01:00:37.050 --> 01:00:39.790
things are going on
people's computer screens.

01:00:39.790 --> 01:00:43.050
But I digress.

01:00:43.050 --> 01:00:48.080
So what barbiturates do is they
make GABA more inhibitory--

01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:50.150
inhibitory enough
that you keel over.

01:00:50.150 --> 01:00:52.610
And now they can slice
you open for surgery.

01:00:52.610 --> 01:00:55.640
This is how one of the main
classes of surgical anesthetics

01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:56.570
work.

01:00:56.570 --> 01:00:59.380
Then there is
another binding site

01:00:59.380 --> 01:01:01.380
on the GABA receptor complex.

01:01:01.380 --> 01:01:05.420
And what that does is it
binds the minor tranquilizers.

01:01:05.420 --> 01:01:06.380
And what are those?

01:01:06.380 --> 01:01:08.910
We've heard about those
a bunch of times already.

01:01:08.910 --> 01:01:13.680
Those are the benzodiazepine,
the valium, and the librium.

01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:15.560
And they work there as well.

01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:17.490
And we've already
heard about how

01:01:17.490 --> 01:01:20.420
anxiety disorders
in some rodent lines

01:01:20.420 --> 01:01:22.130
are related to
different versions

01:01:22.130 --> 01:01:25.130
of the gene for the
benzodiazepine receptor.

01:01:25.130 --> 01:01:27.360
We've just defined
what that gene is.

01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:31.470
That gene codes for one of the
subunits of this massive GABA

01:01:31.470 --> 01:01:32.440
complex.

01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:36.270
So there's another domain there
that binds benzodiazepines--

01:01:36.270 --> 01:01:37.890
the minor tranquilizers.

01:01:37.890 --> 01:01:39.670
What do they do?

01:01:39.670 --> 01:01:42.700
They increase the force
of GABA signaling as well?

01:01:42.700 --> 01:01:45.550
Do they do it as much as
the major tranquilizers?

01:01:45.550 --> 01:01:47.830
Of course it's not the case,
because you wouldn't call

01:01:47.830 --> 01:01:49.620
them minor tranquilizers then.

01:01:49.620 --> 01:01:53.880
These guys potentiate GABA
signaling a moderate amount.

01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:57.200
These guys potentiate
it enormously.

01:01:57.200 --> 01:02:01.940
So now we have these additional
factors binding to these GABA

01:02:01.940 --> 01:02:02.840
receptors.

01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:05.640
A third class-- and
this is, in lots of ways

01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:07.620
the most interesting
one of all, which

01:02:07.620 --> 01:02:10.060
is an additional
binding site there.

01:02:10.060 --> 01:02:14.940
That responds to a hormone
or a derivative of a hormone.

01:02:14.940 --> 01:02:16.540
What is it responding to?

01:02:16.540 --> 01:02:19.780
Derivatives of progesterone.

01:02:19.780 --> 01:02:25.820
Progesterone has a binding
site on the GABA receptor.

01:02:25.820 --> 01:02:28.100
Progesterone is a
steroid hormone.

01:02:28.100 --> 01:02:30.110
It's normally doing
its thing here.

01:02:30.110 --> 01:02:34.820
And now we have, instead, having
a minor slot there on the side

01:02:34.820 --> 01:02:36.950
there that responds
to progesterone.

01:02:36.950 --> 01:02:39.160
What does progesterone do?

01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:42.690
It also potentiates
the effects of GABA.

01:02:42.690 --> 01:02:44.820
What's that about?

01:02:44.820 --> 01:02:48.470
Two implications--
one is, in the 1950s,

01:02:48.470 --> 01:02:51.470
one of the most common
surgical anesthetics used

01:02:51.470 --> 01:02:54.090
was a drug called
Althesin, and it was

01:02:54.090 --> 01:02:56.500
a derivative of progesterone.

01:02:56.500 --> 01:02:59.090
People in the '50s
would be anesthetized

01:02:59.090 --> 01:03:02.230
with this supposedly
reproductive steroid hormone,

01:03:02.230 --> 01:03:06.610
because it has this effect
on the then undiscovered GABA

01:03:06.610 --> 01:03:07.510
receptor.

01:03:07.510 --> 01:03:11.140
It potentiates inhibitory
GABA signaling.

01:03:11.140 --> 01:03:12.860
That's weird.

01:03:12.860 --> 01:03:16.100
So progesterone--
clearly, this relationship

01:03:16.100 --> 01:03:18.360
did not evolve so that
people could do surgery

01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:21.030
on people who didn't want
to get major tranquilizers,

01:03:21.030 --> 01:03:23.180
and instead deal with
the progesterone route.

01:03:23.180 --> 01:03:24.940
Where is this relevant?

01:03:24.940 --> 01:03:29.540
It seems to have something to
do with some of the mood shifts

01:03:29.540 --> 01:03:32.010
over the course of the
reproductive cycle.

01:03:32.010 --> 01:03:34.380
There are reasons, and
pretty good evidence

01:03:34.380 --> 01:03:37.680
in lots of domains, where
perimenstrual syndrome--

01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:39.670
pre-menstrual
syndrome, PMS-- which

01:03:39.670 --> 01:03:41.850
is more accurately
called perimenstrual--

01:03:41.850 --> 01:03:43.190
both before and after.

01:03:43.190 --> 01:03:46.120
What that involves,
clearly in some women,

01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:49.350
is a shortage of
progesterone having

01:03:49.350 --> 01:03:53.610
some of these minor
tranquilizing effects

01:03:53.610 --> 01:03:56.640
by way of the GABA
receptor complex.

01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:59.760
So this is incredibly
complicated stuff

01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:03.020
going on here, as you can see.

01:04:03.020 --> 01:04:06.510
Final domain-- final
interesting elaboration,

01:04:06.510 --> 01:04:10.730
which is now bringing in a
whole additional concept--

01:04:10.730 --> 01:04:13.840
and deserves a board
all of its own.

01:04:19.030 --> 01:04:22.860
So here we have
circular neurons.

01:04:22.860 --> 01:04:26.040
And what we've got is, this is
the neuron we're interested in.

01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:27.260
What's it up to?

01:04:27.260 --> 01:04:30.750
And this is neuron
A. And just to force

01:04:30.750 --> 01:04:33.060
some cognitive flexibility,
this is neuron B,

01:04:33.060 --> 01:04:34.460
going in the wrong direction.

01:04:34.460 --> 01:04:39.690
So we've got neuron B releases
an excitatory neurotransmitter,

01:04:39.690 --> 01:04:43.990
and thus, excites A. OK,
this is not earth shattering.

01:04:43.990 --> 01:04:47.440
It's probably releasing,
say, glutamate for example.

01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:51.090
So remember GABA-- that
inhibitory neurotransmitter

01:04:51.090 --> 01:04:52.340
we just heard about.

01:04:52.340 --> 01:04:55.610
So GABA does inhibitory stuff.

01:04:55.610 --> 01:04:59.030
So maybe there is a GABA neuron
here sending its projection,

01:04:59.030 --> 01:05:00.590
and this one is inhibitory.

01:05:00.590 --> 01:05:03.170
Notice what we've done by
turning neurons into spheres.

01:05:03.170 --> 01:05:05.580
We've lost all the
little dendritic spines.

01:05:05.580 --> 01:05:09.390
So translate that into back to
what it actually looks like.

01:05:09.390 --> 01:05:10.870
This is just schematic.

01:05:10.870 --> 01:05:12.510
So we've got two inputs.

01:05:12.510 --> 01:05:15.900
We've got an excitatory
input by way of glutamate.

01:05:15.900 --> 01:05:18.020
We have an inhibitory
one with GABA.

01:05:18.020 --> 01:05:19.260
What does that imply?

01:05:19.260 --> 01:05:23.240
Dendritic spines in this
neuron contain both receptors

01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:25.680
for glutamate and
receptors for GABA.

01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:27.620
That would be straightforward.

01:05:27.620 --> 01:05:30.430
That would be simple,
if that's how it works.

01:05:30.430 --> 01:05:32.200
That's not what you see.

01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:37.120
Instead, GABA neurons
never send a projection

01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:39.730
onto what would
be neuron A. What

01:05:39.730 --> 01:05:47.060
they do is they send a
projection onto neuron B.

01:05:47.060 --> 01:05:49.650
What's that about?

01:05:49.650 --> 01:05:53.000
What's that about is
what GABA is doing

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:56.770
is making this neuron
less excitable.

01:05:56.770 --> 01:05:59.270
It's working as an
inhibitory neurotransmitter.

01:05:59.270 --> 01:06:01.500
It's making this
neuron less excitable.

01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:03.980
What's happening
here-- this neuron

01:06:03.980 --> 01:06:06.680
has just started
an action potential

01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:08.800
that's coming down the axon.

01:06:08.800 --> 01:06:11.990
And thanks to a heavy
GABA signal coming out,

01:06:11.990 --> 01:06:13.760
it silences it.

01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:17.970
It never gets to the end, and
dumps the neurotransmitter.

01:06:17.970 --> 01:06:20.140
This is totally weird.

01:06:20.140 --> 01:06:22.730
This is completely different
from all the wiring

01:06:22.730 --> 01:06:23.800
you've seen already.

01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:25.450
What's bizarre about it?

01:06:25.450 --> 01:06:28.930
Number one, this is a
neuron forming synapses

01:06:28.930 --> 01:06:31.420
not on the dendrites
of this neuron.

01:06:31.420 --> 01:06:34.490
It's forming a synapse
on the axon of this.

01:06:34.490 --> 01:06:39.680
And thus, we have what is
termed an axoaxonic synapse.

01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:41.970
What does that also imply?

01:06:41.970 --> 01:06:47.680
That there have to be GABA
receptors sitting there

01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:49.670
at the pre-synaptic
end-- just as

01:06:49.670 --> 01:06:52.530
bizarre as the
pre-synaptic autoreceptors.

01:06:52.530 --> 01:06:54.580
Remember, those are for
measuring the amount

01:06:54.580 --> 01:06:56.240
of release-- bookkeeping stuff.

01:06:56.240 --> 01:06:58.820
But here, this is
perfectly conventional

01:06:58.820 --> 01:07:01.010
neuronal responding
to a neurotransmitter,

01:07:01.010 --> 01:07:03.970
but coming at the
completely wrong end

01:07:03.970 --> 01:07:07.910
with this weird
axoaxonic projection.

01:07:07.910 --> 01:07:12.020
But what's most important here
is seeing this implication.

01:07:12.020 --> 01:07:15.820
So what is it that
this neuron does to A?

01:07:15.820 --> 01:07:20.525
What does this GABA neuron
do to the excitability of A?

01:07:20.525 --> 01:07:24.310
And the answer is,
it does nothing.

01:07:24.310 --> 01:07:28.120
It has no effect on
the excitability of A.

01:07:28.120 --> 01:07:33.790
What this GABA neuron does is
alter the ability of neuron B

01:07:33.790 --> 01:07:37.850
to do something
to A. This neuron

01:07:37.850 --> 01:07:40.030
has no direct effect here.

01:07:40.030 --> 01:07:45.950
What it does is it modulates
the activity of this neuron.

01:07:45.950 --> 01:07:49.880
And thus, you have a whole new
class of type of communication.

01:07:49.880 --> 01:07:52.920
Technically, rather than
working as a neurotransmitter,

01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:54.960
it would be termed
GABA typically

01:07:54.960 --> 01:08:00.150
serves a neuromodulatory
role in the nervous system.

01:08:00.150 --> 01:08:03.060
And that's this wonderful
conditional clause

01:08:03.060 --> 01:08:05.920
yet again-- yet
another if/then clause.

01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:09.930
GABA decreases
excitability if and only

01:08:09.930 --> 01:08:14.650
if this neuron is trying to
send an excitatory signal.

01:08:14.650 --> 01:08:18.910
All that GABA does is snuff
out an excitatory signal

01:08:18.910 --> 01:08:22.810
coming down here-- so
modulation in that regard.

01:08:22.810 --> 01:08:26.590
We've already seen another
example of that writ small.

01:08:26.590 --> 01:08:29.210
Back to the GABA complex here.

01:08:29.210 --> 01:08:34.000
What do the major
tranquilizers do there?

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:35.810
What do barbiturates do?

01:08:35.810 --> 01:08:41.160
They do not make this
neuron less excitable.

01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:47.370
What they do is, if and only
if there is GABA coming in,

01:08:47.370 --> 01:08:50.000
it makes the GABA
work even better.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:54.189
The tranquilizers do
not inhibit the neuron.

01:08:54.189 --> 01:08:57.520
The tranquilizers
modulate, potentiate,

01:08:57.520 --> 01:08:59.899
the activity of GABA.

01:08:59.899 --> 01:09:02.620
The minor tranquilizers the
same thing, the progesterone

01:09:02.620 --> 01:09:03.510
the same thing.

01:09:03.510 --> 01:09:05.930
So this is a different
level of this concept

01:09:05.930 --> 01:09:09.350
of neuromodulation--
if/then clauses

01:09:09.350 --> 01:09:11.210
all over the place here.

01:09:11.210 --> 01:09:14.979
So if and only if GABA
is doing its thing,

01:09:14.979 --> 01:09:18.580
any of these minor ligands
will potentiate it.

01:09:18.580 --> 01:09:23.500
If and only if this neuron
is trying to stimulate here,

01:09:23.500 --> 01:09:27.550
GABA will have an inhibitory
effect on the whole system.

01:09:27.550 --> 01:09:31.450
So you see lots and lots
of this modulatory stuff.

01:09:31.450 --> 01:09:35.430
Final example, seeing the
same principle of modulation,

01:09:35.430 --> 01:09:37.159
now occurring in an
endocrine system.

01:09:58.570 --> 01:10:02.380
OK, so now we're measuring
the amount of ACTH coming out

01:10:02.380 --> 01:10:05.090
of the pituitary,
and back to that deal

01:10:05.090 --> 01:10:07.010
that we've got all
these different ways

01:10:07.010 --> 01:10:10.560
in which the brain can
cause the release of ACTH.

01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:13.390
And starting off, we saw CRH.

01:10:13.390 --> 01:10:17.920
So suppose you throw in some
CRH on top of the pituitary

01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:19.814
there, inject it
into the circulation.

01:10:19.814 --> 01:10:23.220
And this much ACTH comes out.

01:10:23.220 --> 01:10:25.220
OK, that's good.

01:10:25.220 --> 01:10:29.670
Now, instead of putting on
CRH, you put in both CRH

01:10:29.670 --> 01:10:32.560
and vasopressin-- a
second one of those.

01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:34.380
And what do you see?

01:10:34.380 --> 01:10:36.380
That's perfectly logical.

01:10:36.380 --> 01:10:40.220
You've got two things
driving ACTH secretion.

01:10:40.220 --> 01:10:44.180
Now you put on vasopressin
just by itself.

01:10:44.180 --> 01:10:47.730
And what you get is this.

01:10:47.730 --> 01:10:51.100
You get no secretion.

01:10:51.100 --> 01:10:55.780
Does vasopressin stimulate
the release of ACTH?

01:10:55.780 --> 01:10:57.010
No, it doesn't.

01:10:57.010 --> 01:11:00.310
What vasopressin does
is it potentiates

01:11:00.310 --> 01:11:02.690
the activity of CRH.

01:11:02.690 --> 01:11:06.230
It modulates CRH's activity.

01:11:06.230 --> 01:11:08.990
Vasopressin does
nothing by itself.

01:11:08.990 --> 01:11:12.810
If and only if
there is CRH getting

01:11:12.810 --> 01:11:15.910
to those pituitary
cells, then vasopressin

01:11:15.910 --> 01:11:17.950
will potentiate its actions.

01:11:17.950 --> 01:11:20.940
All of those other
releasors-- the vasopressin,

01:11:20.940 --> 01:11:24.240
the oxytocin, epinephrine,
norepinephrine-- none of them

01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:26.640
are direct releasors
on their own.

01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:31.490
They all are modulating,
potentiating CRH's effects.

01:11:31.490 --> 01:11:34.370
So what we've got here
is this enormous realm

01:11:34.370 --> 01:11:37.050
of complexity of
all of these if/then

01:11:37.050 --> 01:11:40.720
clauses, various hormones
that are not directly

01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:43.630
causing anything,
neurotransmitters that are not

01:11:43.630 --> 01:11:46.870
directly causing anything,
ligands for receptors

01:11:46.870 --> 01:11:48.090
that are not, either.

01:11:48.090 --> 01:11:50.480
What they're all
doing is, if and only

01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:54.584
if something else is happening,
something else is going on,

01:11:54.584 --> 01:11:56.000
there's an additional
ligand, they

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:59.830
do their thing-- lots and lots
of these conditional clauses.

01:11:59.830 --> 01:12:01.420
More complexity there.

01:12:01.420 --> 01:12:04.970
OK, so what does all of
this get us here at the end?

01:12:04.970 --> 01:12:08.610
Obvious-- lots of
individual variability,

01:12:08.610 --> 01:12:11.370
lots of ways in which
these systems are changing

01:12:11.370 --> 01:12:15.790
in response to experience, all
that subunit changing business.

01:12:15.790 --> 01:12:19.400
Something happens and you
get rid of one subunit.

01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:21.230
Replace it with another,
and you've changed

01:12:21.230 --> 01:12:23.240
the excitability of the system.

01:12:23.240 --> 01:12:27.380
All sorts of over and over
conditional if/then clauses,

01:12:27.380 --> 01:12:30.110
tremendous increase
in the complexity.

01:12:30.110 --> 01:12:32.770
These themes will come
through again and again

01:12:32.770 --> 01:12:35.030
in the second half
of the course.

01:12:35.030 --> 01:12:36.630
So let's stop at this point.

01:12:36.630 --> 01:12:39.270
Are there any questions, since
this was a major download?

01:12:39.270 --> 01:12:40.620
Check the extended notes.

01:12:40.620 --> 01:12:42.590
Are the extended
notes posted yet?

01:12:42.590 --> 01:12:43.230
Not yet.

01:12:43.230 --> 01:12:45.740
They will be some time or other.

01:12:45.740 --> 01:12:47.485
OK, any questions?

01:12:52.460 --> 01:12:56.260
OK, so go read those notes
as soon as they're up.

01:12:56.260 --> 01:12:59.520

Stanford University.

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:12.180
OK, and-- is this audible?

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:13.040
No.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:13.900
It's really quiet.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:14.910
Really quiet.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.196
Something's wrong with
the sound system today.

00:00:18.196 --> 00:00:19.560
How's that?

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.810
No.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:22.953
How's that?

00:00:22.953 --> 00:00:23.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:24.810
Placebo?

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.550
Maybe that would have worked?

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.640
OK, well, I guess I will
just have to shout out.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:30.140
But--

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.990
OK, help?

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.910
[INAUDIBLE]

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.292
[INAUDIBLE] falling off.

00:00:49.292 --> 00:00:50.000
Was I doing it--?

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.670
That's fine, yeah.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:51.170
OK.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:55.220
Good.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.761
So let's see.

00:00:55.761 --> 00:00:59.050
That is an event you
probably should check out.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.970
I'm still irritated you didn't
want a signed football for me,

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:03.650
but nonetheless--

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:09.240
OK, so, starting off, as the
large numbers of empty seats

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.460
imply, not only is
Monday the midterm

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.090
but today's not a topic that
we covered on the midterm.

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.660
So, in case you want to flee
right now, here's your chance.

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:18.750
I won't be upset.

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.280
But what we do here is
a look at our last topic

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.610
of our buckets-- in this
case, our neurobiology one.

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.680
And the whole
premise for this one

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.250
is to cover the most
wonderful, interesting parts

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.000
of the brain, which you're
going to hear squat about when

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.730
you wind up in medical school.

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.320
Again, from the other day,
what they will teach you

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.730
about endlessly
is stuff that goes

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.190
wrong with your
spinal cord or stuff

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.620
that goes wrong with
parts of your brain

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.810
that regulate your bladder and
your balance and motoric stuff.

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.270
How come-- because--

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.780
Yes?

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:53.738
You can't hear a thing.

00:01:53.738 --> 00:01:54.570
No.

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.090
No.

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.590
Um-- [NOISE OF HELPLESSNESS]

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.090
He's going to try to
find the sound guy.

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.200
OK, somebody's off to get sound.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.389
But in the meantime, I will
pantomime bladder problems.

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:11.460
So what you've got-- I will
try-- maybe in the back,

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.040
just start waving each time
I start hypoventilating

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.380
and run out of volume.

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.110
But what you've got here is not
the part of the nervous system

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.130
that's easy to find
out about, because it's

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.740
right on the surface.

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.640
Not the part that
people focus on,

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.570
because there's a lot
of spinal-cord injuries

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:31.530
and you can tell exactly
what's wrong by which

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.410
toe is no longer moving.

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.800
This is, instead,
focusing on the part

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.850
of the brain most
centrally involved

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.900
in emotion-- the limbic system.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.490
Now-- obvious why that
should be of interest to us,

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.620
more so than spinal pathways
controlling movement.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.720
And, in terms of making
sense of the limbic system,

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.930
this is going to be the most
horribly, multisyllabic,

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.820
diagram-laden class
of the entire class.

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.220
But, in terms of making
sense of it, what we will see

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.650
is there's some very,
very logical things going

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.030
on-- very logical strategies.

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.620
OK.

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.020
Originally, the
limbic system was not

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.400
known as the "limbic
system" but instead

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.860
had a name reflecting the
fact that people started off

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.600
studying it in rats.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.190
And you take a rat
brain, which looks

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.980
kind of like this from
the side, and you've

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.850
got your spinal cord and
cerebellum and cortex.

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.600
And what is this thing,
at the way front, there?

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.880
This is the olfactory bulb.

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.000
This is the olfactory
system of a rodent brain.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.430
And this is drawn exactly to
scale, down to the millimeter.

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.260
This is huge.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:41.480
This thing is huge.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.000
The olfactory bulb
and its projections

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.460
are 40% of the
brain of a rodent.

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:51.590
And when people began to
understand where the neurons

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.370
in the olfactory bulb were
sending their projections,

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.020
it was an area of the brain,
the underside of the brain,

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.990
which people very quickly
began to call this region

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:04.920
the "rhinencephalon"--
the "nose-brain."

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.240
Because, obviously, this
is what was processing

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.810
all this whomping great amount
of olfactory information coming

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:12.370
in.

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.520
And this area that
we now know and love

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.500
as the "limbic
system" at the time

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.350
was called the "rhinencephalon."

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.540
This dominated, early on,
with the neuroanatomists,

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.190
which is to say the people
who just sat there and said,

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.980
gee whiz, that's an awfully
large part of the brain, there.

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:29.780
And where does it
send its projections?

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.940
As people instead,
in the '30s and '40s,

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.810
began to understand the function
of this part of the brain, what

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.920
emerged was a very
different viewpoint,

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.400
from a different
school, which is,

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.480
it's doing all sorts
of stuff with emotion.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.470
And this picture of
this region of the brain

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:47.530
as having that role.

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:49.960
For reasons I don't
completely understand,

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.040
somehow the people who liked
the, it's all about emotion,

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.100
started calling it
the "limbic system."

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.380
And thus you had one of
the most central conflicts

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.420
of the 20th century, which
was whether this thing should

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:04.320
be called the "rhinencephalon"
or the "limbic system."

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.970
And thousands of innocent
people were slaughtered

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:08.540
before it was all over with.

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:11.730
Brother pitted against
brother savagery.

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:14.570
And what we've got-- much
of Picasso's paintings

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:16.540
were about some of the
atrocities committed

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:18.500
by the rhinencephalon people.

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.450
But what wound up
ultimately happening

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:23.480
was a completely
logical resolution.

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:27.030
"Rhinencephalon," "limbic
system"-- is it about odor?

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:28.330
Is it about emotion?

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.290
And all you have to do is
think like an ethologist,

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:32.770
and you've got your answer.

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:34.940
Which is, if you're
a rat, there's

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:40.620
not an emotion on earth that's
not intertwined with olfaction.

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.130
The rat's emotional
world is utterly

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:45.920
driven by olfactory information.

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:49.850
And thus, for a rat, the
rhinencephalon, the nose-brain,

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:52.580
is the part of the brain
getting all the information

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:55.300
coming in that has
any relevance to

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:59.020
the good, interesting, emotional
stuff going on in a rat's life.

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.510
So there's massive resolution.

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:02.690
Peace in their time.

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:05.750
Suddenly, this recognition
that, of course,

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:10.085
a rhinencephalon is going
to be sending projections--

00:06:10.085 --> 00:06:12.460
is going to be all a part of
the part of the brain that's

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:14.640
doing emotion for you.

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:17.920
Now, of course, as
well-trained ethologists,

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:21.120
you should immediately be having
a relevant thought already,

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.100
which is, well,
so what's up with

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:27.740
the [? rhinencephalon-fame ?]
nose-brain limbic system

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:31.540
in a species that's not
some smelly rodent thing?

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:33.120
In a species, for
example, that's

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:37.190
paying attention to an enormous
amount of, say, auditory stuff.

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:39.480
How about all those
birds, with the birdsong

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:43.380
business going on, or auditory
displays of territoriality,

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:44.700
or things of that sort?

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:47.190
And you look in those
brains, and the limbic system

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:51.550
is not the rhinencephalon, in
terms of what part of the brain

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:55.050
is disproportionately enlarged
and what part of the brain

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:57.800
is sending projections
into the limbic system.

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.600
Look at a bird brain, and
it is not a rhinencephalon,

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:03.870
it's an ear encephalon
or something or other.

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:06.720
And you've got to think
like an ethologist.

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:09.000
And suddenly you're
in a world where

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.210
something as bizarre as electric
fish, who communicate socially

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:17.030
through electricity,
have electroreceptors

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:18.790
which are sending a
lot of information

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:20.250
to this part of the brain.

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:24.530
It is not the nose-brain, it
is the, among other things,

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:26.370
"getting whatever
sensory information

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:28.660
is most pertinent to
my emotional life"

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:29.860
part of the brain.

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:32.640
So the limbic system,
initially utterly viewed

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:36.430
as intertwined with olfaction,
now instead recognizing,

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:40.150
as good neuroethologists,
what it's really about.

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:40.750
OK.

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:42.870
So, as an introduction
to it, we need

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:47.560
to start off with a very
simplified, quick overview

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.170
of large parts of
the nervous system.

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:50.960
You got bits of this last week.

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:52.770
But, just to give
an initial overview,

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:54.920
here, just to orient
what's happening.

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:58.010
And what we see, here--
and, again, a very accurate,

00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:00.800
technically drawn diagram--
you see the brain comes

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.220
in three different pieces.

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:04.560
And each one has
a different color.

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:07.970
And this reflects the work of
a guy named Paul MacLean, one

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:09.910
of the giants in the field.

00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:13.000
And everyone is required to
say his name, at this point.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.540
And this model that he came
up with in the 1950s or so--

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:21.030
the triune brain-- the
three-layer model of what

00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:22.860
brain function is about.

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:29.920
So what you have is the most
central, ancient, archaic, most

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:32.730
phylogenetically
conserved-- which is a fancy

00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:36.110
way of saying that, all sorts
of vertebrates out there,

00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:38.640
this part of the brain
is basically the same.

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:42.640
This is the hypothalamus,
talking to the pituitary.

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:46.260
This is the pathways going
from the hypothalamus

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:50.325
down the spinal-cord
areas called "brain stem,"

00:08:50.325 --> 00:08:51.240
"mid brain."

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:55.910
This is what MacLean called the
"reptilian" part of the brain,

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:58.800
reflecting the fact
that our section, here,

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:02.960
is a whole lot like the type
you would find in a reptile.

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:06.760
This is the ancient stuff that
does the purely automatic,

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:08.610
regulatory things.

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:12.100
You've got neurons, here, that
have to tell you something

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:14.262
about temperature regulation.

00:09:14.262 --> 00:09:17.120
Ooh, back to that
endocrinology stuff.

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:17.680
Let's see.

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:19.800
What's a hormone
that's got something

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:24.560
to do with metabolism, body
temperature, thyroid hormone?

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:28.800
So you remember the hypothalamus
being part of that cascade.

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:31.250
The hypothalamus has
a relevant hormone

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:34.280
for the pituitary, which
then tells your thyroid

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:35.340
gland all of that.

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:38.430
So how does the hypothalamus
need to know what's going on?

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:42.230
That same feedback information
stuff from the other day.

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:44.430
There's got to be neurons
in the hypothalamus that

00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:45.720
can tell your temperature.

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:47.470
And-- too cold?

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:49.670
Let's get some more
thyroid hormone out.

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:50.180
Great.

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:53.430
That makes complete sense,
in terms of regulatory loops.

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:54.620
Totally boring.

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:55.120
OK.

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:57.580
So this is a part of the
brain that keeps your body

00:09:57.580 --> 00:09:58.980
temperature right.

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:02.810
It keeps your blood glucose
levels sort of modulated

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:03.570
in some ways.

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:05.710
It talks a lot to the pancreas.

00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:09.330
It does stuff like-- it's
monitoring your blood pressure

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:11.720
in various places,
it's remembering

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:14.970
that you're running hard,
so let's tell the heart

00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:16.540
to beat a little bit faster.

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:18.150
Completely boring stuff.

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:22.950
Just robotic, regulatory
circuitry and loops, there.

00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:25.960
So this ancient, reptilian
part of the brain.

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:27.470
Totally boring
part of the brain--

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:30.360
until you get something wrong
with that part of the brain,

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:32.830
and suddenly it seems
mighty interesting.

00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:35.880
Remind me-- how many
of you were in Biocore?

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:37.120
OK, lots of folks.

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:39.020
People in there will
remember, I told you

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:41.860
about one of the
all-time creepy diseases

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:43.740
that you do not
want to get, which

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:45.980
is called "Ondine's
curse," which

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:49.020
is where you get some
lesions, some stroke damage,

00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:51.360
to one of these midbrain areas.

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:54.630
This part of the brain that
does something very boring,

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:56.520
until it doesn't do
it for you anymore.

00:10:56.520 --> 00:11:01.120
Ondine was apparently some
Greek nymph or something

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:04.660
that Zeus was hitting on
unsuccessfully at some point

00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:06.110
and greatly frustrated.

00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:08.470
He put this Olympian
curse on her,

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:10.750
which was that she
had Ondine's curse.

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:12.380
Or maybe Ondine's
curse was what she

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:13.970
had to say about him in return.

00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:17.850
But what this was about
is, she lost the capacity

00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:21.870
to do automatic breathing.

00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:23.020
Whoa!

00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:24.350
That's a drag!

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:26.102
Automatic breathing,
in that you're

00:11:26.102 --> 00:11:28.435
just sort of going along,
there, breathing now and then.

00:11:28.435 --> 00:11:32.860
And we do that pretty eptly,
as opposed to ineptly.

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:36.020
And what you don't have
to do is stop and say,

00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:39.160
whoa-- this would be a good
time to expand my diaphragm,

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:40.750
or whatever it is you do there.

00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:43.090
But you've got a lesion
in this part of the brain,

00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:47.220
and you lose the capacity
for automatic breathing.

00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:49.800
OK, somebody who's
not in Biocore,

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:54.960
tell me what do you die of,
if you have Ondine's curse?

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:56.610
Oop-- who just mumbled that?

00:11:56.610 --> 00:11:57.840
[INAUDIBLE] asphyxiation.

00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:59.590
Asphyxiation, good.

00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:01.925
OK, and at what particular time?

00:12:01.925 --> 00:12:02.800
When you fall asleep?

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:03.650
Yeah.

00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:05.760
Or, you actually don't
die of asphyxiation

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:07.250
when you're falling asleep.

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:08.360
How come?

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:10.970
Because you keep waking up.

00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:13.120
You fall asleep, and
30 seconds later you

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:16.620
wake up because you're on
the edge of asphyxiation.

00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:19.020
You die of sleep deprivation.

00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:22.450
How's that for one creepy
thing to have happen to you?

00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:25.510
So you can start obsessing over
that, as an eventual problem.

00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:28.980
Here's the boring part of the
brain, this reptilian stuff.

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:31.890
We do this part of the
brain exactly the same way

00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:33.190
that lizards do.

00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:36.250
Sitting on top of it
is the area that we now

00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:38.240
put all of our
attention and love

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:42.080
upon, which is the limbic
system, this emotional part

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:45.560
of the brain which we will
soon see in sickening detail.

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:49.530
The limbic system is mostly
a mammalian invention.

00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:53.840
Birds, reptiles, fish do
not have especially complex

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:54.680
emotional lives.

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:57.070
Uh-oh-- there's people from
Russ Fernald's lab in here.

00:12:57.070 --> 00:12:59.360
Do not tell him
I just said that.

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:00.100
But--

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:01.600
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:02.120
Yeah.

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:04.000
Not a word about it.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:04.620
OK.

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:07.560
But it is mostly a
mammalian invention,

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:09.940
greatly expanding
the limbic system,

00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:12.640
emotional complexity--
stay tuned.

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:14.980
The next hour and a
half is about what

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:16.820
is much more subtle
than saying ooh,

00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:18.620
this does emotions for you.

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:22.700
Sitting on top is the
cortex, the gleaming,

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:27.060
analytical machine of cortical
function and cognitive

00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:28.770
expertise that we have.

00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:32.140
This is something that all
sorts of species out there--

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:36.650
fish and birds and-- not bees,
but birds and almost bees.

00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:40.440
And what you got there is one
that nonetheless is greatly

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:43.210
expanded in
vertebrates and mammals

00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:46.350
and greatly expanded,
even more so, in primates

00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:48.450
and even more so than in us.

00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:51.590
And, as we will see, one
area of the cortex which

00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:55.910
is really very uniquely
human and very intertwined

00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:57.440
with the limbic system.

00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:01.260
As we'll see, what is critical
in making sense of the cortex,

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.820
with respect to all this
stuff-- this limbic,

00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:06.130
emotion, behavior
stuff, and everything

00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:07.620
coming for the rest
of the course--

00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:10.380
is the rumors of
the cortex being

00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:14.930
this rational, independent,
analytical part of the brain

00:14:14.930 --> 00:14:16.910
that goes about its
business while all

00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:20.570
this hormonal-emotional muck
is going on south of it,

00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:22.240
is completely wrong.

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:25.060
All sorts of aspects
of cortical function

00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:29.370
are being influenced by
hormones and thus, indirectly,

00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:31.690
under the regulation
of here, all sorts

00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:34.770
of aspects of cortical
function are being influenced

00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:36.170
by the limbic system.

00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:38.180
And all you have
to do to appreciate

00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:43.110
that is think back on times
of extreme emotional duress

00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:48.170
and arousal where you made some
incredibly stupid decision that

00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:50.720
seemed like a brilliant
idea at the time.

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:53.830
Therein is proof that
your limbic system

00:14:53.830 --> 00:14:56.760
is able to influence
decision-making going on

00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:58.530
up in the cortex.

00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:01.310
And, as we will see, of
great relevance to us

00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:05.330
as a fancy species-- the
cortex has vast ability

00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:07.880
to influence stuff
going on below there.

00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:11.110
And all you need to do to
prove that is sit and think

00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:13.960
about the fact that you are
not going to live forever.

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:15.670
And suddenly this
part of the brain

00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:18.880
is going to be kicking out
CRH and things like that.

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:20.680
And you've just done
it with thought.

00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:23.710
There's bidirectionality
that completely

00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:26.440
does in the notion that--
here's the emotional part

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:28.640
of the brain, here's
the cognitive part.

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:31.080
And that's completely,
completely wrong,

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:32.530
that they're separable.

00:15:32.530 --> 00:15:34.530
Major figure in the
field-- a guy named

00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:37.789
Antonio Damasio, who's probably
the best thinker about any

00:15:37.789 --> 00:15:39.580
of this stuff, had a
book a number of years

00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:42.180
ago called Descartes' Error.

00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:44.000
Descartes, who
saw that there was

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.840
this great potential separation
between thought and emotion.

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:49.900
And that's complete nonsense.

00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:53.730
So, starting off merely on
an anatomical level-- which

00:15:53.730 --> 00:15:58.330
is to say, which neurons where
are sending axonal projections

00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:00.913
where else-- tons
and tons of cross

00:16:00.913 --> 00:16:04.720
talk between the limbic
system and the cortex.

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:05.370
OK.

00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:08.540
So we now have this
utterly undefined mass

00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:10.186
of limbic system.

00:16:10.186 --> 00:16:13.340
And we also have a
tabula rasa there.

00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:14.820
But-- here it is.

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:15.510
OK.

00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:17.820
But what you've
got is, of course,

00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:21.780
subparts of the limbic system--
subparts out the wazoo.

00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:25.470
There are people who spend
their entire lives arguing about

00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:28.740
whether this subsubnuclei
of this part of the brain

00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:31.260
should logically be
considered as having seven

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:33.340
subparts or eight subparts.

00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:36.480
Extremely complicated
part of the brain.

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:39.650
And what we'll been looking
at, here, is the circuitry.

00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:42.950
The circuitry, and what
each individual subregion

00:16:42.950 --> 00:16:44.530
of the limbic system does.

00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:47.740
All of this got sorted
out in the 1930s

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:51.370
or so by a neurologist
named James Papez.

00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:54.440
And I think there remains
enormous controversy over

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:57.030
whether his name is pronounced
"papes" or "pap-ez."

00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:59.290
But probably neither is correct.

00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:02.280
But what you wound up getting,
as a result of his work,

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:04.630
was the first person
to begin to think

00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:09.089
in a systematic way of,
hey, all of these structures

00:17:09.089 --> 00:17:12.569
in that old rhinencephalon
part of the brain-- all

00:17:12.569 --> 00:17:16.280
of these structures are sending
projections to each other.

00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:20.720
There seems to be some organized
module of interconnected

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:21.530
function.

00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:23.369
And it was around
that time that people

00:17:23.369 --> 00:17:26.300
began to be seeing what
some of the effects were,

00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:29.040
what some of the roles of these
were-- behavior-- and suddenly

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:32.430
out comes the-- this is the
emotional part of the brain.

00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:36.480
And the circuitry that's
since been delineated is known

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:39.080
as the "Papez circuit,"
or the "Pap-ez" circuit,

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:41.340
or the whatever the
guy's name was circuit.

00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:42.890
And we will see that shortly.

00:17:42.890 --> 00:17:46.010
He was the first person
to begin to see, just

00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:49.500
on the level of
connections, that this

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:51.370
is an area that
seems to be doing

00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:54.090
a lot of interrelated functions.

00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:55.340
Quick definition.

00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:57.930
What do we mean by
"doing connections"?

00:17:57.930 --> 00:18:01.100
Again, back to last
week's introductory stuff,

00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:04.320
a connection, a
projection-- neurons

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:07.990
in this part of the brain
are sending their axons

00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:11.310
to that part of the brain
and forming synapses there.

00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:14.430
This area projects to that area.

00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:16.130
So where are the projections?

00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:18.300
Where are the
connections to translate

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:20.550
this neuroanatomy
concept into sort

00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:22.000
of the most accessible level?

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.720
What parts of the brain
are talking to this region?

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:29.230
And what parts of the brain
is this region talking to?

00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:32.770
Where are the axons coming from,
and where are these neurons'

00:18:32.770 --> 00:18:34.990
axons heading off to?

00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:37.330
So, circuitry, in that regard.

00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:40.796
So this is going to be an
enormously complicated circuit.

00:18:40.796 --> 00:18:42.170
But, at the end
of the day, there

00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:45.420
is one way to think about
it, which is unifying,

00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:47.340
which clarifies
everything, which

00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:51.540
is the thing that every
single nucleus and subnucleus

00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:54.100
and subsubnucleus in the
limbic system-- the thing

00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:56.880
that everything in the
limbic system wants to do

00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:59.440
is tell the
hypothalamus what to do.

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:02.040
The entire limbic
system is structured

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:06.649
around trying to influence
hypothalamic function.

00:19:06.649 --> 00:19:08.690
There's all those connections
going to the cortex

00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:10.150
and other areas, as well.

00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:13.020
But, for a first pass,
the way to conceptualize

00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:16.350
the limbic system is,
it tries to influence

00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:18.760
what the hypothalamus is up to.

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:20.540
Why would that be interesting?

00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:23.540
You know that, from last week.

00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:27.250
Hypothalamus is the
central hub for all

00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:29.520
of that neuroendocrine stuff.

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:32.090
And thus the entire
world of your brain

00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:36.010
wanting to influence behavior
and emotion in any sort

00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:38.160
of endocrine
context-- you're going

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:40.170
to have to be talking down here.

00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:42.580
From earlier last
week, hypothalamus

00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:46.610
also playing a pivotal role in
the autonomic nervous system

00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:48.190
coming down the spine.

00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:50.920
The whole world
in which emotions

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:55.540
change how your body works is
all about the limbic system

00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:58.320
telling the
hypothalamus what to do.

00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:01.960
And thus what you see is,
all the circuitry in here

00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:04.350
is built around
trying to influence

00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:06.120
hypothalamic function.

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:09.200
In a certain way, as follows--
which will make perfect sense.

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:12.230
Which is, what every single
area of the limbic system

00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:15.010
wants to do is tell the
hypothalamus what to do.

00:20:15.010 --> 00:20:17.950
And in addition, the other
thing that it really wants to do

00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:20.300
is make sure no other
part of the limbic system

00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:22.630
is telling the
hypothalamus what to do.

00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:24.860
And thus you've got
all sorts of areas

00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:28.470
with means of stimulating
regions of the hypothalamus

00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:33.420
and inhibiting the activity
of other limbic regions.

00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:35.620
So you've got all
these patterns, here,

00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:38.910
of stimulating down
there, inhibiting here--

00:20:38.910 --> 00:20:42.370
all built around these different
regions wanting to influence

00:20:42.370 --> 00:20:43.990
hypothalamic function.

00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:48.090
So amid it being a total,
complete mess of circuitry,

00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:51.460
one rule helps you begin
to sort out the details.

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:55.470
Which is, OK, so you've got
this area of the limbic system,

00:20:55.470 --> 00:20:57.450
and it wants to influence
the hypothalamus

00:20:57.450 --> 00:20:58.670
at the end of the day.

00:20:58.670 --> 00:21:03.180
How many synapses away
is the hypothalamus?

00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:07.500
How many neurons are
intervening between this part

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:09.980
of the limbic system
having something to say,

00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:12.970
getting action potentials,
and influencing something

00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:14.160
[INAUDIBLE] hypothalamus?

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:17.310
This winds up being a
pretty good rule of thumb,

00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:19.260
in terms of looking
at influence.

00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:23.290
You send a projection straight
into the hypothalamus--

00:21:23.290 --> 00:21:25.850
in other words, you
are one synapse away--

00:21:25.850 --> 00:21:28.470
and you're going to be having
a lot more control over what's

00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:31.380
going on there than if you
have to send a projection here,

00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:33.680
which sends one there and
there and bouncing around,

00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:36.740
and 14 synapses later
you're influencing

00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:38.220
hypothalamic function.

00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:39.110
How come?

00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:42.320
Well, for one thing,
one synapse away you're

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:44.400
going to be a lot faster.

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:48.230
And the other reason being, if
there's 14 synapses in between,

00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:50.120
everybody downstream
of you is going

00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:51.860
to have their own
opinion about things

00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:53.970
and it turns into a
game of Telephone.

00:21:53.970 --> 00:21:56.110
The most direct
way of influencing

00:21:56.110 --> 00:22:00.600
hypothalamic function is
to have as few synapses

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:02.620
in your projection as possible.

00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:05.870
And thus what you see
is, most limbic regions

00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:09.530
have a number of different ways
of getting information down

00:22:09.530 --> 00:22:11.610
to the hypothalamus,
and they differ

00:22:11.610 --> 00:22:14.070
in the number of
synapses, and thus they

00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:16.200
differ in their power.

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:19.770
And what we'll see is
just one example, here.

00:22:19.770 --> 00:22:20.930
Ah, we'll do that later.

00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:21.430
OK.

00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:23.500
So, lots of examples of that.

00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:26.820
Just to give you a sense about
something interesting in us,

00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:30.020
in terms of this rule of
how many synapses away.

00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:32.800
So we've got this limbic
part of the brain.

00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:36.710
And back to that rhinencephalon
business-- that, you know,

00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:41.950
rodents are super olfactory
and fish do whatever they do.

00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:43.594
And, again, don't tell Fernald.

00:22:43.594 --> 00:22:45.260
And all these other
species have their--

00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:48.550
And we're not a particularly
olfactory species.

00:22:48.550 --> 00:22:50.300
Here's something interesting.

00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:53.670
Every single one of
your sensory modalities

00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:57.690
has to go through a minimum
of three or four synapses

00:22:57.690 --> 00:23:00.010
to first plunk
down any influence

00:23:00.010 --> 00:23:05.130
in the limbic system-- except
for our olfactory systems,

00:23:05.130 --> 00:23:08.780
which are one synapse away
from the limbic system.

00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:11.600
So even us, we are not
terribly olfactory,

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:14.550
and we've got atrophied
olfactory bulbs.

00:23:14.550 --> 00:23:15.560
That's a rat.

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:19.440
Our olfactory system takes
up less than 5% of our brain.

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:22.890
Nonetheless, olfaction
is one synapse away

00:23:22.890 --> 00:23:24.830
from the limbic
system, telling you

00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:26.540
something about
that whole world,

00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:28.730
that visual information
can tell you

00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:30.780
a lot about calculus equations.

00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:34.260
Olfaction is the thing
that flashes us back

00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:36.030
to some emotional setting.

00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:37.400
That's the reason for it.

00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:41.110
Great example of this "counting
the number of synapses"

00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:42.130
strategies.

00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:45.500
The fewer synapses,
the more influence.

00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:48.530
So, what are the structures
of the limbic system?

00:23:48.530 --> 00:23:51.340
First pass--
unfortunately, it is

00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:54.570
going to make sense to
learn all the details

00:23:54.570 --> 00:23:57.060
of these different subregions,
because you will be hearing

00:23:57.060 --> 00:23:58.516
about all of them again.

00:23:58.516 --> 00:24:00.390
You won't be hearing
about them Monday night,

00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:03.690
but you'll be hearing about them
all in the next month or so.

00:24:03.690 --> 00:24:06.400
And so learn the stuff.

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:07.100
OK.

00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:09.640
So, what's going on
in the limbic system?

00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:12.080
What is inside here?

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:14.640
What we've got are
the major structures

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:15.760
of the limbic system.

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:18.560
Sitting in there, you
recognize the pituitary.

00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:21.650
And thus sitting right on top
of that is the hypothalamus.

00:24:21.650 --> 00:24:24.330
And here we have all
these other regions.

00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:27.130
First off-- the amygdala.

00:24:27.130 --> 00:24:28.880
The amygdala-- I have
already mentioned

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:30.570
it a number of times in class.

00:24:30.570 --> 00:24:33.350
We will hear details
soon about what it does.

00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:36.130
You've already heard
some intimations of it.

00:24:36.130 --> 00:24:40.620
So the amygdala is this
cluster of neurons--

00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:44.190
beginning to get another
anatomical concept, here.

00:24:44.190 --> 00:24:49.820
You've got nuclei-- clusters
of neuronal cell bodies--

00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:54.620
and you have projections--
areas of lots of axons.

00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:59.220
So you will have a whole
lot of cell bodies here

00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:02.980
and sending their
projections off there.

00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:06.880
You will wind up seeing this as
a densely packed area of cell

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:07.670
bodies.

00:25:07.670 --> 00:25:10.350
Each one of these areas
I will be mentioning now

00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:14.250
are areas where the
cell bodies are nuclei.

00:25:14.250 --> 00:25:15.630
Interesting elaboration.

00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:17.760
As you also learned
last week, one

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:20.670
of the things that makes action
potentials go really fast

00:25:20.670 --> 00:25:23.670
is that business about
myelin-- myelination.

00:25:23.670 --> 00:25:27.100
These are very membranous
wrappings-around.

00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:31.040
Membrane-- very fatty,
membrane lipid stuff,

00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:33.620
which happens to
be white in color.

00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:36.960
Cell bodies tend to
be grey in color.

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:38.900
And this is where
the dichotomy comes

00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:42.610
in brain science between
grey-matter and white-matter

00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:43.800
parts of the brain.

00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:48.160
Grey matter are nuclei--
cell bodies, packed in there.

00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:52.760
White matter are cables of
axons going from one place

00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:54.830
to another, wrapped in myelin.

00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:57.850
So, just translating
that into sort of terms

00:25:57.850 --> 00:25:59.070
that we're familiar with.

00:25:59.070 --> 00:26:03.016
OK, so, starting off-- the first
nucleus of the limbic system,

00:26:03.016 --> 00:26:04.610
the amygdala.

00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:07.480
The amygdala-- if you
study neuroanatomy,

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:09.450
most of these places
come with some terms

00:26:09.450 --> 00:26:12.150
derived from Latin or Greek
or something or other.

00:26:12.150 --> 00:26:16.360
And the amygdala--
"amygdala" means "almond."

00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:18.250
It means "almond."

00:26:18.250 --> 00:26:19.730
A number of years
ago, I reported

00:26:19.730 --> 00:26:23.530
that it means "peach pit," and
that turned out to be wrong.

00:26:23.530 --> 00:26:25.944
And I was also wrong as to
whether it was Greek or Latin.

00:26:25.944 --> 00:26:27.360
And I probably
should have written

00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:28.840
that down from two years ago.

00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:31.990
But, from some stupid
old classic language,

00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:33.140
this means "almond."

00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:37.050
And it looks like an almond.

00:26:37.050 --> 00:26:37.750
OK.

00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:41.000
Next, we have, in front
of it, the hippocampus.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.180
Hippocampus, which we will
hear lots about, as well.

00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:46.060
And you will see
the hippocampus is

00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:50.600
a big structure spanning over
there relevant to its function.

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:52.902
"Hippocampus," Latin
for "seahorse."

00:26:52.902 --> 00:26:54.360
But if you look at
the hippocampus,

00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:55.984
it doesn't look at
all like a seahorse,

00:26:55.984 --> 00:26:58.000
suggesting neuroanatomists
don't go out

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.160
to the beach anywhere near as
often as would be a good idea.

00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:03.310
It actually looks
like a jelly roll.

00:27:03.310 --> 00:27:07.520
But people who spoke Latin
didn't know about jelly rolls,

00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:10.710
and thus they had
to-- seahorses.

00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:12.210
So you've got the
hippocampus, here.

00:27:12.210 --> 00:27:15.630
We will shortly be seeing
how these two communicate

00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:17.970
with each other--
where the axons are

00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:19.510
going between these nuclei.

00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:22.390
Next, an area
called the "septum."

00:27:22.390 --> 00:27:24.670
And there's a number
of septums in the body.

00:27:24.670 --> 00:27:27.660
"Septum" is a term for
a midline structure.

00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:31.770
You have a septum separating
the two nostrilly parts

00:27:31.770 --> 00:27:32.670
of your nose.

00:27:32.670 --> 00:27:35.440
The center of the four chambers
of your heart is a septum.

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:38.000
"Septum," here, is
a structure that's

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.020
right at the midbrain-- at
the midline of the brain.

00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:44.680
Then we have, just tucked
behind the hippocampus,

00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:46.820
something called the
"mammillary bodies."

00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:48.950
Yeah, you gotta
know these terms.

00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:52.460
You will eventually
be so, so grateful

00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:55.360
for having all this stupid
terminology under your belt.

00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:59.350
It will make the rest of
your life far, far richer.

00:27:59.350 --> 00:27:59.850
OK.

00:27:59.850 --> 00:28:01.470
So you've got
mammillary body here.

00:28:01.470 --> 00:28:04.860
Sitting on top of that is a
remarkable structure that you

00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:06.830
probably could have
intuited was there,

00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:09.340
because you know about
the hypothalamus.

00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:10.910
"Hypothalamus"--
what does that mean?

00:28:10.910 --> 00:28:13.189
It means it's the thing
that's under the thalamus.

00:28:13.189 --> 00:28:15.480
I bet you there's something
a little bit north of there

00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:16.410
called the thalamus.

00:28:16.410 --> 00:28:17.330
And here it is.

00:28:17.330 --> 00:28:22.780
Which is possibly also known as
the "hypersuprahypothalamus,"

00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:24.620
but instead it's known
as the "thalamus."

00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:27.280
And we will see some
stuff that it does.

00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:31.090
Next are two very
interesting areas,

00:28:31.090 --> 00:28:34.220
which we will hear tons
about in lectures to come--

00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:37.680
in particular the lectures on
depression-- a region called

00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:42.580
the "ventral tegmental area"
and a region called the "nucleus

00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:43.630
accumbens."

00:28:43.630 --> 00:28:46.290
Every one of these
is in the handouts.

00:28:46.290 --> 00:28:48.830
Don't freak out about trying
to get down the terms,

00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:49.670
at this point.

00:28:49.670 --> 00:28:51.650
Just at least get
the abbreviations.

00:28:51.650 --> 00:28:55.280
Here are the major players
in the limbic system--

00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:57.100
with one addition.

00:28:57.100 --> 00:29:01.280
And this is one that bedeviled
the field for a long time

00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:04.910
and reflected a very, very
great piece of insight.

00:29:04.910 --> 00:29:08.510
A neuroanatomist back-- who
sort of was in his prime

00:29:08.510 --> 00:29:10.500
in the latter part
of the last century--

00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:13.430
a guy named Walle
Nauta, a Dutch guy

00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:18.710
who was arguably the best
neuroanatomist of the last half

00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:19.820
of the 20th century.

00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:22.820
And in the 1950s, studying
neural connectiveness,

00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:27.180
what he came up with was
a totally nutty idea.

00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:29.880
Because, at that point,
we were about 20-- "we"--

00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:33.510
were about 10, 20 years
into the limbic concept.

00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:37.520
These are subcortical
areas involved in emotion,

00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:39.670
and they all send
projections to each other.

00:29:39.670 --> 00:29:43.510
And Nauta, based on looking
at the anatomy-- what

00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:46.590
parts of the brain were sending
projections where, what parts

00:29:46.590 --> 00:29:50.190
were getting projections
from where-- Nauta said,

00:29:50.190 --> 00:29:53.470
one part of the cortex
should actually be classified

00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:55.270
as part of the limbic system.

00:29:55.270 --> 00:29:57.090
Oh, this was heresy!

00:29:57.090 --> 00:30:00.260
He was driven out of
the neuroanatomy club.

00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:03.880
And he was insisting that
this made sense, anatomically,

00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:06.180
and predicted it would
make sense, eventually,

00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:07.150
functionally.

00:30:07.150 --> 00:30:08.930
And he was totally right.

00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:12.370
The most interesting area
of the cortex-- a region

00:30:12.370 --> 00:30:14.410
called the "frontal cortex."

00:30:14.410 --> 00:30:16.800
Also known as the
"prefrontal cortex."

00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:18.780
An obviously real
distinction there.

00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:20.890
We will ignore that distinction.

00:30:20.890 --> 00:30:24.660
An area-- the frontal
cortex, including a subarea

00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:26.740
called the "anterior cingulate."

00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:29.580
This is a part of
the cortex which

00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:32.380
is intimately
interconnected with all

00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:34.370
these subcortical regions.

00:30:34.370 --> 00:30:38.790
It is arguably the cortical
component of the limbic system.

00:30:38.790 --> 00:30:40.430
Why is that the case?

00:30:40.430 --> 00:30:44.340
We will see, amid lots of
cortex [INAUDIBLE] stuff,

00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:47.390
like, telling you, is it here
that you were just stimulated,

00:30:47.390 --> 00:30:48.500
or was it there?

00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:50.990
Did somebody just play
an A or an A flat?

00:30:50.990 --> 00:30:53.210
Which limb do I want
to move right now?

00:30:53.210 --> 00:30:55.330
All sorts of
nuts-and-bolts stuff.

00:30:55.330 --> 00:30:57.450
How do I do long division?

00:30:57.450 --> 00:30:58.570
All those things.

00:30:58.570 --> 00:31:02.950
The frontal cortex has this
world of utterly un-cortex-like

00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:05.150
things that it's interested in.

00:31:05.150 --> 00:31:11.460
Emotional regulation, impulse
control, long-term planning,

00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:13.590
gratification postponement.

00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:16.230
It is, without question,
the most interesting part

00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:17.130
of the brain.

00:31:17.130 --> 00:31:20.740
And I say that as
someone who's just spent,

00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:23.350
like, the last 30
years of my life

00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:27.010
just obsessing over the
hippocampus, and I was wrong.

00:31:27.010 --> 00:31:29.320
I mean, the hippocampus
has done well by me.

00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:30.830
I have been faithful to it.

00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:32.862
But nonetheless it has
struck me, more and more,

00:31:32.862 --> 00:31:35.320
that this is where I should
have been sitting, because this

00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:38.160
is oh so much more
interesting part of the brain

00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:41.130
than some dumb old area that
remembers stuff for you.

00:31:41.130 --> 00:31:45.650
Frontal cortex is what makes
us most definedly human.

00:31:45.650 --> 00:31:49.190
It is proportionately
larger in humans

00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:50.630
than in any other species.

00:31:50.630 --> 00:31:52.670
It is the most recently evolved.

00:31:52.670 --> 00:31:54.960
Something that we will
hear about in coming weeks

00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:58.790
is, it's the last part of
the brain to fully mature.

00:31:58.790 --> 00:32:01.200
Most of you in here
do not yet have

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:04.270
a frontal cortex which
is fully online-- which

00:32:04.270 --> 00:32:06.150
is an amazing thing.

00:32:06.150 --> 00:32:08.420
Frontal cortex isn't
fully myelinated

00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:11.280
until in your mid-20s,
on the average.

00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:13.470
This is not-- oh, you
were born with all

00:32:13.470 --> 00:32:14.700
these neural connections.

00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:18.390
This is a part of the brain that
does impulse control for you.

00:32:18.390 --> 00:32:21.500
And it is not working yet very
well, in most of you guys,

00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:22.810
for a while to come.

00:32:22.810 --> 00:32:24.860
I don't know what this
explains, but it no doubt

00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:26.160
explains a great deal.

00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:28.400
This is an incredibly
interesting part

00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:30.860
of the brain which has
nothing to do with--

00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:32.950
oh, let's turn that
sensory information

00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:34.770
into a three-dimensional
map, and I could

00:32:34.770 --> 00:32:36.420
recognize whose face it is.

00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:40.750
And this instead is a cortical
area utterly intertwined

00:32:40.750 --> 00:32:43.540
with what's going on
in the limbic system.

00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:45.760
One interesting
measure of it, which

00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:50.000
is looking at this frontal
part of the cortical brain.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.580
And an interesting
measure, worked on by a guy

00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:55.780
named Ian Dunbar some
years ago, looking at,

00:32:55.780 --> 00:32:59.430
by now, about 150
different primate species.

00:32:59.430 --> 00:33:02.920
And, in each one, asking,
what percentage of the brain

00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:05.640
is made up by this
prefrontal cortex?

00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:08.180
How much of the brain
is devoted to it?

00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:11.810
And what he showed, across 150
different primate species--

00:33:11.810 --> 00:33:15.810
the single best predictor of
how big the frontal cortex was

00:33:15.810 --> 00:33:19.440
going to be was, how large
is the average social group

00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:21.120
for this species?

00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:22.960
In other words,
you sitting around

00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:24.980
in some species where
you've got to keep track

00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:27.950
of three other people in
there, or you live in a species

00:33:27.950 --> 00:33:31.070
where there's 150
individuals in your troop.

00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:34.150
And the latter species is
going to have proportionally

00:33:34.150 --> 00:33:36.070
a far bigger frontal cortex.

00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:38.610
What this suggests,
on a certain level,

00:33:38.610 --> 00:33:42.330
is, this utterly defining
part of the brain

00:33:42.330 --> 00:33:46.410
evolved for gossip
and social relations

00:33:46.410 --> 00:33:50.230
and appropriate behavior
and social intelligence

00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:52.220
and all sorts of
stuff like that.

00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:54.440
Truly interesting
part of the brain,

00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:58.410
utterly intertwined with the
traditional limbic regions.

00:33:58.410 --> 00:34:01.640
So this Nauta guy was
completely correct.

00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:02.490
OK.

00:34:02.490 --> 00:34:06.080
So, now adding in the
next layer of miserable

00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:10.120
factoids you need to have, which
will show the same principles

00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:11.420
I've been talking about.

00:34:11.420 --> 00:34:14.679
Which is how these areas
connect with each other.

00:34:14.679 --> 00:34:16.570
At this point, it
has basically been

00:34:16.570 --> 00:34:20.239
shown that every limbic region
projects to-- sends axons

00:34:20.239 --> 00:34:21.900
to-- some other limbic region.

00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:25.389
I'm just going to put in some
of the main pathways, here.

00:34:25.389 --> 00:34:31.239
First one, called the
"amygdalofugal pathway,"

00:34:31.239 --> 00:34:34.130
which carries information back
and forth between the amygdala

00:34:34.130 --> 00:34:35.429
and hippocampus.

00:34:35.429 --> 00:34:38.179
Amygdaloid neurons projecting
to the hippocampus,

00:34:38.179 --> 00:34:40.159
hippocampal neurons
projecting back.

00:34:40.159 --> 00:34:42.672
And, as we will
see, an awful lot

00:34:42.672 --> 00:34:44.630
of what the amygdala is
involved with-- I think

00:34:44.630 --> 00:34:48.030
I've mentioned
already-- fear, anxiety,

00:34:48.030 --> 00:34:51.810
learning to be afraid
of particular stimuli.

00:34:51.810 --> 00:34:53.580
A lot of what the
hippocampus does

00:34:53.580 --> 00:34:55.360
is help you remember stuff.

00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:58.000
This connection between
them is critical

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:01.380
when you are learning that every
time the guy-- the Russian guy

00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:02.959
with the beard--
puts the light on,

00:35:02.959 --> 00:35:04.500
you're going to get
a shock, and then

00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:06.916
you're going to have to salivate
when he tells you there's

00:35:06.916 --> 00:35:07.430
food coming.

00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:11.380
What the amygdala is doing there
is hijacking the hippocampus

00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:14.870
at that time to have hippocampus
do some memory formation

00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:18.010
for you about a
fearful stimulus.

00:35:18.010 --> 00:35:21.870
So, interconnections there
that are extremely important.

00:35:21.870 --> 00:35:26.750
Next we've got hippocampus
needing to talk to the septum.

00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:31.400
And it does so with a series
of projections-- bidirectional,

00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:34.930
again-- called the "fimbria
fornix." "Fornix"--

00:35:34.930 --> 00:35:38.515
here's showing just how much fun
neuroanatomy can be. "Fornix"

00:35:38.515 --> 00:35:42.380
is from Latin or Greek
or whatever for "arch,"

00:35:42.380 --> 00:35:44.800
and apparently it comes
from referring to the Roman

00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:46.060
Colosseum.

00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:49.270
And supposedly this is the
origins of another word.

00:35:49.270 --> 00:35:51.040
That, during
classical Roman times,

00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:52.990
this is where
prostitutes would be.

00:35:52.990 --> 00:35:55.350
So people who would say
they were going off there

00:35:55.350 --> 00:35:58.740
would be going off to the
arches-- off to fornicate.

00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:00.000
That's the origins of that.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.330
So isn't this such
a cool subject?

00:36:02.330 --> 00:36:05.720
So here we've got the fornix,
there, completing this arch.

00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:08.060
Hippocampus talking to septum.

00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:11.890
Septum then sending
a huge projection,

00:36:11.890 --> 00:36:14.600
coming down to the
hypothalamus, back

00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:16.420
on to the mammillary bodies.

00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:19.220
And projections going
back this way, as well.

00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:23.840
A major, major limbic pathway
called the "medial forebrain

00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:26.660
bundle."

00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:27.700
OK.

00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:29.870
Just to make things
more complicated,

00:36:29.870 --> 00:36:32.640
now, we now have
another projection

00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:36.110
from the amygdala that goes
straight to the hypothalamus.

00:36:36.110 --> 00:36:38.410
And this is a total pain.

00:36:38.410 --> 00:36:41.630
This is a pathway called
the "stria terminalis."

00:36:41.630 --> 00:36:43.430
And, by all logic,
what it should do

00:36:43.430 --> 00:36:45.850
is go from here to there.

00:36:45.850 --> 00:36:47.470
No, that's not what it does.

00:36:47.470 --> 00:36:49.640
Here's what the stria
terminalis does.

00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:51.520
It starts in the
amygdala, and it

00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:54.780
goes looping just on the
outside of the hippocampus,

00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:58.020
around this way, and
lands back there.

00:36:58.020 --> 00:36:59.830
What's up with that?

00:36:59.830 --> 00:37:01.280
That is ridiculous.

00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:04.080
What you see, here,
is a principle

00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:07.330
about a lot of this
neurobiological wiring

00:37:07.330 --> 00:37:11.900
stuff, which is, you get
totally nutty, inefficient,

00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:14.990
you know, going out through
left field projections.

00:37:14.990 --> 00:37:16.370
How did that happen?

00:37:16.370 --> 00:37:20.020
What that tells you is, at
some point, embryologically,

00:37:20.020 --> 00:37:23.510
these two structures were
not so close to each other.

00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:25.340
And part of the
embryonic development

00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:27.670
involved flipping
over like this.

00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:30.040
And suddenly the amygdala
is right next door,

00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:34.030
long after it made the most
efficient possible connection

00:37:34.030 --> 00:37:34.940
by way of this.

00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:37.160
And now you've got this
completely nutty way

00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:38.430
to get around there.

00:37:38.430 --> 00:37:41.040
So often you see really
inefficient pieces

00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:43.610
of wiring, here,
telling you something

00:37:43.610 --> 00:37:46.340
about embryonic development.

00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:50.180
Some of the time, you also
see nutty pieces of wiring

00:37:50.180 --> 00:37:53.130
telling you something about
the evolutionary history

00:37:53.130 --> 00:37:54.420
of this nervous system.

00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:56.650
Here's one example--
and this is one outside

00:37:56.650 --> 00:37:59.280
of the limbic system but
great demonstration of this,

00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:02.370
having to do with some
motor systems in the brain.

00:38:02.370 --> 00:38:03.170
OK.

00:38:03.170 --> 00:38:05.440
You're here, and you
decide what you would like

00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:08.280
to do is bend this one finger.

00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:10.410
What would be the logical thing?

00:38:10.410 --> 00:38:14.250
Some part of the cortex up
here involved in motor control

00:38:14.250 --> 00:38:15.800
that we're not
interested in should

00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:19.190
send a message down to
this finger saying "bend."

00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:19.870
No.

00:38:19.870 --> 00:38:21.440
That's not what happens.

00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:23.480
One part of this
motor system called

00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:27.770
the "pyramidal nervous system"
sends a message to all five

00:38:27.770 --> 00:38:30.470
of your fingers
saying "do this."

00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:33.070
Meanwhile, there's another
motor system called

00:38:33.070 --> 00:38:36.620
the "extrapyramidal system"
that quickly sends down a signal

00:38:36.620 --> 00:38:39.850
and says, if you happen to
hear the pyramidal system tell

00:38:39.850 --> 00:38:43.740
fingers 1, 3, 4, and 5 to bend,
don't pay attention to it.

00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:46.265
And suddenly you've
got this going on.

00:38:46.265 --> 00:38:48.350
Like-- what is
this-- a committee

00:38:48.350 --> 00:38:49.550
that came up with this?

00:38:49.550 --> 00:38:52.710
This is totally crazy,
inefficient wiring--

00:38:52.710 --> 00:38:55.920
until you think about the
evolution of the system.

00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:59.680
As follows, there's not a
whole lot of species out there

00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:02.080
that have a need, in terms
of reproductive success,

00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:03.934
to play trills on the piano.

00:39:03.934 --> 00:39:05.350
There's not a whole
lot of species

00:39:05.350 --> 00:39:07.910
that have to do independent
movement of fingers.

00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:11.060
The basic wiring of
this motor system

00:39:11.060 --> 00:39:16.640
is one of this crude, pyramidal
system of just sending messages

00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:17.520
down the line, there.

00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:20.610
Extend claws, retract--
all that sort of thing.

00:39:20.610 --> 00:39:23.939
And along come primates and
raccoons and a few other things

00:39:23.939 --> 00:39:25.480
that suddenly get
it into their heads

00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:27.100
to move fingers independently.

00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:29.230
So you've got a
choice, at that point.

00:39:29.230 --> 00:39:32.370
You can either renovate
the entire pyramidal system

00:39:32.370 --> 00:39:35.810
and rip it out and rewire so
that each finger is controlled

00:39:35.810 --> 00:39:36.800
independently.

00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:39.240
And that's never going to
work, because, you know,

00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:42.080
the contractor doesn't show up,
and it's been a million years.

00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:44.280
Or what you do is,
you have to come up

00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:48.260
with a second, newer system
that's superimposed on top.

00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:50.660
Totally ass-backwards,
inefficient way

00:39:50.660 --> 00:39:52.300
of doing-- what
does that tell you?

00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:55.920
The extrapyramidal system
is more recently evolved.

00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:57.920
It is more of a primate system.

00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:00.140
And that's where you
get the fine control.

00:40:00.140 --> 00:40:04.660
What you often see is bits
of really clunky wiring

00:40:04.660 --> 00:40:07.960
and regulation-- tells you
things about embryonic life,

00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:09.990
and it tells you
about evolution.

00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:12.280
Back to this
classic quote, which

00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:15.020
is "Evolution is
not an inventor,

00:40:15.020 --> 00:40:16.880
evolution is a tinkerer."

00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:19.240
It is just playing with
what's already there

00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:21.140
and trying to come up
with something better.

00:40:21.140 --> 00:40:23.300
That was the idea
from lectures ago.

00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:25.260
Which, all things
considered, squid

00:40:25.260 --> 00:40:28.180
do not swim anywhere near
as fast as barracuda.

00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:30.140
But for something that
used to be a barnacle,

00:40:30.140 --> 00:40:31.640
they're pretty good swimmers.

00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:34.360
You have to realize
where things started

00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:36.670
and where the
adaptations came from.

00:40:36.670 --> 00:40:37.340
OK.

00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:38.650
So, more wiring.

00:40:38.650 --> 00:40:44.130
And now we've got the mammillary
bodies talking to the thalamus.

00:40:44.130 --> 00:40:48.310
The mammillothalamic tract.

00:40:48.310 --> 00:40:51.760
And then you've got the
thalamus talking bidirectionally

00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:53.590
with the frontal cortex.

00:40:53.590 --> 00:40:55.630
So you begin to see
the starts, here,

00:40:55.630 --> 00:40:59.030
of kind of a looping circuit,
and going bidirectionally--

00:40:59.030 --> 00:41:00.160
all of that.

00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:03.370
Two additional areas--
this ventral tegmental area

00:41:03.370 --> 00:41:05.190
and this nucleus accumbens.

00:41:05.190 --> 00:41:08.120
Ventral tegmentum sends a
lot of information here,

00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:11.050
and from on there it goes
to every single place.

00:41:11.050 --> 00:41:13.170
And we will eventually
see great relevance

00:41:13.170 --> 00:41:15.130
of that bidirectionally.

00:41:15.130 --> 00:41:15.730
OK.

00:41:15.730 --> 00:41:17.490
So, horrible circuitry.

00:41:17.490 --> 00:41:19.847
What you should already
see is one example

00:41:19.847 --> 00:41:21.930
of what I was telling you
about, before-- counting

00:41:21.930 --> 00:41:23.240
number of synapses.

00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:24.980
So you're the
amygdala, and you want

00:41:24.980 --> 00:41:27.050
to tell the
hypothalamus what to do.

00:41:27.050 --> 00:41:28.320
You've got a choice.

00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:32.360
You can do it by way of this
stria terminalis thing, which

00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:34.310
is one synapse away.

00:41:34.310 --> 00:41:37.360
Or you could do it by talking
to the hippocampus, which

00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:39.870
talks to the septum, which
talks to the hypothalamus.

00:41:39.870 --> 00:41:42.810
Where's the most important
stuff coming out of the amygdala

00:41:42.810 --> 00:41:44.040
to the hypothalamus?

00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:46.450
By way of this stria terminalis.

00:41:46.450 --> 00:41:48.750
What's this communication about?

00:41:48.750 --> 00:41:50.780
A lot of the time,
it's the amygdala

00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:53.610
trying to get the hippocampus
to shut up so the amygdala can

00:41:53.610 --> 00:41:55.590
dominate hypothalamic events.

00:41:55.590 --> 00:41:58.100
That begins to show
this principle of,

00:41:58.100 --> 00:42:00.000
how many synapses away?

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:03.000
So we have all of this
incredible wiring, here.

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:04.820
And, again, every
single one of these,

00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:06.760
there's other minor
ones there, as well,

00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:08.510
and they all interconnect
with each other.

00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:10.380
But these are some
of the major ones.

00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:13.990
Does this make sense?

00:42:13.990 --> 00:42:15.360
How about now?

00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:16.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:17.600
OK.

00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:20.660
So, that's the limbic system,
in terms of basic wiring.

00:42:20.660 --> 00:42:22.980
So what everyone
needs to do now is

00:42:22.980 --> 00:42:24.860
spend the next five
minutes filling in what

00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:27.620
those abbreviations were for.

00:42:27.620 --> 00:42:31.610
And then we will finally get
past this stupid A sends to B

00:42:31.610 --> 00:42:33.210
and begin to look at function.

00:42:33.210 --> 00:42:34.700
OK, so, five minutes.

00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:36.760
OK, so, pushing on.

00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:40.520
Good question that just came
up, relevant to Biocore people.

00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:42.350
So what I just
said-- that business

00:42:42.350 --> 00:42:45.830
about the olfactory
system is one synapse away

00:42:45.830 --> 00:42:48.230
from the limbic system--
isn't it hopefully amazing?

00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:52.080
Remember Biocore stuff-- that
business-- the visual cortex,

00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:54.800
the first layer that does
dots, the second layer

00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:57.730
does lines, at certain
angles-- that's

00:42:57.730 --> 00:43:00.080
where you're getting
all the synapses coming

00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:03.320
in which delay you from
getting information into there.

00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:07.000
Auditory system has the
same multilayer processing.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:10.880
Tactile-- all of those are like
that, except for olfaction.

00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:14.550
That drops its first signaling
right off into the amygdala.

00:43:14.550 --> 00:43:16.860
So very, very
different circuitry.

00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:17.460
OK.

00:43:17.460 --> 00:43:19.960
So, now, finally
getting to function.

00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:24.740
So how do you figure out the
function of the limbic system?

00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:26.910
A bunch of different
techniques-- bunch

00:43:26.910 --> 00:43:28.690
of different
experimental techniques.

00:43:28.690 --> 00:43:31.250
First, you have
the greatest thing

00:43:31.250 --> 00:43:33.600
that has been most
helpful in all

00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:36.060
of the history of
neuroscience in understanding

00:43:36.060 --> 00:43:39.490
how different parts of the brain
work, which is endless warfare.

00:43:39.490 --> 00:43:41.770
Because what that
gives you are people

00:43:41.770 --> 00:43:44.440
who have had parts of their
brain blown out of the water,

00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:44.950
there.

00:43:44.950 --> 00:43:48.430
You have-- nice
jargon-- missile wounds.

00:43:48.430 --> 00:43:51.690
So, after every big,
good, fun, energetic war,

00:43:51.690 --> 00:43:54.090
all sorts of neuroanatomists
get their careers,

00:43:54.090 --> 00:43:56.480
like, jump-started
for years afterward,

00:43:56.480 --> 00:44:00.470
studying people who have had
parts of the brain lesioned,

00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:04.280
damaged, destroyed by
circumstances like that.

00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:06.500
But, you know, any old
time, neuroanatomists

00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:08.600
are delighted to get
ahold of somebody who's

00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:11.420
had a brain region damaged.

00:44:11.420 --> 00:44:14.260
There's one guy, in fact--
everybody has heard of HM,

00:44:14.260 --> 00:44:14.960
I suspect.

00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:16.540
Anybody not heard of HM?

00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:19.620
OK.

00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:20.880
So you've all heard of HM.

00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:23.391
There's another guy-- NA.

00:44:23.391 --> 00:44:26.740
NA his septum taken out.

00:44:26.740 --> 00:44:28.080
And what happened to NA?

00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:30.540
All that it ever says
in the literature

00:44:30.540 --> 00:44:34.060
was that he was at a wedding
and his septum was destroyed

00:44:34.060 --> 00:44:36.360
by a miniature fencing foil.

00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:37.960
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:38.866
That's it!

00:44:38.866 --> 00:44:41.480
That's the literature
on what happened to NA.

00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:43.927
So NA, you know,
was a draft dodger

00:44:43.927 --> 00:44:45.510
in endless different
wars, and then he

00:44:45.510 --> 00:44:47.610
gets done in by his,
like, sister-in-law's

00:44:47.610 --> 00:44:49.060
wedding kind of thing.

00:44:49.060 --> 00:44:51.570
But lesions--
lesions are critical.

00:44:51.570 --> 00:44:55.150
So human studies, where you
have had accidental damage

00:44:55.150 --> 00:44:57.030
to brain regions.

00:44:57.030 --> 00:45:00.000
Or the rare,
horrifying world where

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.540
there was damage done to
human brains intentionally.

00:45:02.540 --> 00:45:05.720
Back to class 1-- the
frontal-lobotomy business.

00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:08.590
Just to clarify--
frontal lobotomies,

00:45:08.590 --> 00:45:11.620
in its classic form,
was not lesioning

00:45:11.620 --> 00:45:13.120
the prefrontal cortex.

00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:15.110
It was just putting
a big-ol' cut

00:45:15.110 --> 00:45:18.110
somewhere through there that
took out limbic structures.

00:45:18.110 --> 00:45:21.450
Given the fact that most frontal
lobotomies were being done,

00:45:21.450 --> 00:45:24.210
I kid you not, with
an ice axe-- that

00:45:24.210 --> 00:45:26.690
was the tool of choice
for the neurosurgeons--

00:45:26.690 --> 00:45:29.460
this was not a very
precise surgical technique.

00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:31.830
But it was taking out all
sorts of limbic structures.

00:45:31.830 --> 00:45:35.530
So the rare world of
intentional lesions in humans,

00:45:35.530 --> 00:45:39.190
HM being the rare version
of that, where it was done

00:45:39.190 --> 00:45:40.950
for a valid clinical reason.

00:45:40.950 --> 00:45:43.200
Much more often in
the lesion world

00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:46.390
is taking experimental
animals, where you go in

00:45:46.390 --> 00:45:48.800
and you selectively
destroy some region.

00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:51.980
And the strategy, whether
in humans or animals,

00:45:51.980 --> 00:45:54.560
is absolutely
obvious, which is, OK,

00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:58.395
if we destroy this part of the
brain, what doesn't work right

00:45:58.395 --> 00:45:58.895
anymore?

00:45:58.895 --> 00:46:01.020
Ooh, we've just found
out something about what

00:46:01.020 --> 00:46:02.590
that part of the brain does.

00:46:02.590 --> 00:46:05.010
Next strategy-- classic one.

00:46:05.010 --> 00:46:07.730
Now, instead of
lesioning a brain region,

00:46:07.730 --> 00:46:11.620
you put down an electrode where
you stimulate that region.

00:46:11.620 --> 00:46:16.110
You artificially generate
action potentials there.

00:46:16.110 --> 00:46:20.450
This is a brain region that
gets projections from here,

00:46:20.450 --> 00:46:23.200
and this region is not
saying anything whatsoever.

00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:26.980
There are no activity here to
send action potentials there.

00:46:26.980 --> 00:46:27.966
Nothing's happening.

00:46:27.966 --> 00:46:29.340
And what you're
doing instead is,

00:46:29.340 --> 00:46:32.460
by sticking an electrode
in there and stimulating,

00:46:32.460 --> 00:46:35.100
you are simulating
an input, there.

00:46:35.100 --> 00:46:37.776
Stimulate, and now
see what happens.

00:46:37.776 --> 00:46:39.150
Ooh, we've just
learned something

00:46:39.150 --> 00:46:41.210
about that part of the brain.

00:46:41.210 --> 00:46:44.260
Rarely done with humans,
except for epileptics

00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:47.090
with severe types of
intractable epilepsy

00:46:47.090 --> 00:46:49.250
where a certain
type of neurosurgery

00:46:49.250 --> 00:46:51.080
is done to correct it.

00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:52.660
And it's often quite effective.

00:46:52.660 --> 00:46:56.380
On the way down, the
electrodes, going down-- often,

00:46:56.380 --> 00:46:59.300
the neurosurgeons
stimulate on the way down,

00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:01.890
to be assured that they're
in the right place.

00:47:01.890 --> 00:47:02.570
OK.

00:47:02.570 --> 00:47:03.430
Next version.

00:47:03.430 --> 00:47:06.600
Now, instead, you put down
an electrode, and that one's

00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:08.540
a recording electrode.

00:47:08.540 --> 00:47:12.020
What that one is telling you
is-- so you're down in here--

00:47:12.020 --> 00:47:15.770
when are these neurons
getting electrically excited?

00:47:15.770 --> 00:47:19.390
Or, putting it in here, when
are action potentials pulsing

00:47:19.390 --> 00:47:23.580
through this part of the brain,
picking up what's going on?

00:47:23.580 --> 00:47:26.190
And what really
winds up being fancy

00:47:26.190 --> 00:47:29.420
are people who, for example,
can put a stimulating electrode

00:47:29.420 --> 00:47:31.720
down here and a
recording electrode

00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:33.260
there-- that sort of thing.

00:47:33.260 --> 00:47:37.040
There's a whole world of
incredibly adept people

00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:40.290
who could record from one
single neuron at a time.

00:47:40.290 --> 00:47:41.390
Or how's about this?

00:47:41.390 --> 00:47:44.480
Back to those
neurotransmitter receptors

00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:48.400
coupled to an ion channel,
an ion channel that opens up,

00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:49.860
and stuff goes in or out.

00:47:49.860 --> 00:47:52.250
There is a technique
called "patch clamping,"

00:47:52.250 --> 00:47:57.230
where people can record from one
single ion channel at a time.

00:47:57.230 --> 00:47:59.890
Which is just madness,
that people could do this.

00:47:59.890 --> 00:48:02.720
But, in terms of the resolution,
all of these techniques

00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:06.200
artificially get neurons
excited, electrically.

00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:07.930
See what happens next.

00:48:07.930 --> 00:48:11.840
Put in a recording device to
tell you what's happening.

00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:14.370
And thus you begin to
do things like, ooh,

00:48:14.370 --> 00:48:16.350
every time I do
this with my hand,

00:48:16.350 --> 00:48:18.170
these neurons get
action potentials.

00:48:18.170 --> 00:48:20.570
We've just learned
something pertinent, there.

00:48:20.570 --> 00:48:21.580
What else?

00:48:21.580 --> 00:48:24.230
Another realm of techniques
you've already heard about,

00:48:24.230 --> 00:48:26.980
which is this plain
old, boring anatomy.

00:48:26.980 --> 00:48:29.500
Which part of the
brain sends axons

00:48:29.500 --> 00:48:30.870
to this part of the brain?

00:48:30.870 --> 00:48:32.400
How many synapses away?

00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:34.860
All of the means of
deriving information

00:48:34.860 --> 00:48:36.160
that we heard about before.

00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:39.820
So that's the whole world of
just looking at the circuitry,

00:48:39.820 --> 00:48:42.460
telling you about
function from that.

00:48:42.460 --> 00:48:45.400
Then, of course, there's a whole
world of biochemical stuff.

00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:47.710
You are measuring
levels of things.

00:48:47.710 --> 00:48:50.310
You are measuring levels
of neurotransmitters.

00:48:50.310 --> 00:48:53.850
Molecular biology-- seeing
where different genes

00:48:53.850 --> 00:48:55.170
are being expressed.

00:48:55.170 --> 00:48:57.440
If you see genes that
are only expressed

00:48:57.440 --> 00:48:59.380
in this part of
the limbic system,

00:48:59.380 --> 00:49:02.070
under some circumstance,
you've just learned something

00:49:02.070 --> 00:49:03.210
about its function.

00:49:03.210 --> 00:49:04.530
All that sort of thing.

00:49:04.530 --> 00:49:08.110
Finally, a world where you
could do really interesting,

00:49:08.110 --> 00:49:10.810
trendy stuff with humans,
in terms of seeing what's

00:49:10.810 --> 00:49:12.170
up in the limbic system.

00:49:12.170 --> 00:49:16.500
Where what you do is, you
can image brain regions.

00:49:16.500 --> 00:49:18.350
And this is now a whole
world of-- instead

00:49:18.350 --> 00:49:20.320
of sitting around, waiting
for somebody to die,

00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:22.470
and slice their
brain up afterward,

00:49:22.470 --> 00:49:27.770
instead you could do imaging--
CAT scans, CT Scans, MRI--

00:49:27.770 --> 00:49:31.360
where you see the areas of
different parts in the brain--

00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:32.920
how big or small they are.

00:49:32.920 --> 00:49:34.670
You can look at
the metabolic rate

00:49:34.670 --> 00:49:36.220
in certain areas of the brain.

00:49:36.220 --> 00:49:38.990
Which is sort of the
equivalent of recording.

00:49:38.990 --> 00:49:41.180
Stick in an
electrode, and you can

00:49:41.180 --> 00:49:43.200
tell what's happening
here by when

00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:45.690
there's electrical excitation.

00:49:45.690 --> 00:49:48.090
Use functional brain
imaging, and you

00:49:48.090 --> 00:49:50.150
can tell what's
happening here by,

00:49:50.150 --> 00:49:53.240
when suddenly there's more
oxygen or glucose being

00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:54.190
consumed, here--

00:49:54.190 --> 00:49:55.730
Same sort of information.

00:49:55.730 --> 00:49:57.560
With the imaging,
though, you're getting

00:49:57.560 --> 00:50:00.545
a picture of the entire
brain all at once.

00:50:00.545 --> 00:50:01.920
And one of the
cool things that's

00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:03.980
come out of those
studies is showing

00:50:03.980 --> 00:50:07.940
that some regions of the brain,
particularly the limbic system,

00:50:07.940 --> 00:50:10.849
will change their
size over time.

00:50:10.849 --> 00:50:12.390
One example which
I think we've heard

00:50:12.390 --> 00:50:16.460
about already, which is that
the amygdala gets bigger

00:50:16.460 --> 00:50:19.510
in people with posttraumatic
stress disorder.

00:50:19.510 --> 00:50:23.460
Severe, severe traumatic
history, and this part

00:50:23.460 --> 00:50:25.030
of the brain expands.

00:50:25.030 --> 00:50:28.320
People with PTSD--
amygdalas are larger.

00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:31.040
You look at the metabolic
rate in the amygdala.

00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:34.940
People with PTSD, it is
more metabolically reactive

00:50:34.940 --> 00:50:37.560
than other areas of the
brain or than in people

00:50:37.560 --> 00:50:39.460
who don't have PTSD.

00:50:39.460 --> 00:50:41.620
So that's just told you
something interesting.

00:50:41.620 --> 00:50:43.880
Nice cellular basis of that.

00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:46.930
Periods of severe
stress cause neurons

00:50:46.930 --> 00:50:50.550
in the amygdala to grow
more dendritic processes.

00:50:50.550 --> 00:50:53.040
That's probably why the
amygdala gets bigger.

00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:55.010
So that's the sort of
thing that gets picked up

00:50:55.010 --> 00:50:57.990
on humans, with brain imaging.

00:50:57.990 --> 00:51:00.470
Another version, over
in the hippocampus,

00:51:00.470 --> 00:51:03.310
just as pertinent to some of
the stuff we will hear about.

00:51:03.310 --> 00:51:06.260
People with long-term,
major depression.

00:51:06.260 --> 00:51:08.850
Their hippocampus gets smaller.

00:51:08.850 --> 00:51:11.510
Their hippocampus
atrophies a bit.

00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:14.420
And the same sort of
information being picked up.

00:51:14.420 --> 00:51:16.430
You see an area
of the brain that

00:51:16.430 --> 00:51:20.140
is plastic enough, that is
malleable enough, that its size

00:51:20.140 --> 00:51:23.450
will change in response to
certain types of experiences

00:51:23.450 --> 00:51:24.580
or emotional states.

00:51:24.580 --> 00:51:27.791
You just learned something about
what that part of the brain

00:51:27.791 --> 00:51:28.290
does.

00:51:28.290 --> 00:51:31.230
So that winds up being
extremely informative,

00:51:31.230 --> 00:51:33.880
when there's differences in
the size of different brain

00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:36.520
regions, in response
to experience.

00:51:36.520 --> 00:51:37.090
OK.

00:51:37.090 --> 00:51:39.700
So that's generally
the set of tools

00:51:39.700 --> 00:51:42.160
that are available to people
trying to figure out what's

00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:43.890
going on in the limbic system.

00:51:43.890 --> 00:51:47.690
And all of these tools come
with some important limitations.

00:51:47.690 --> 00:51:50.220
These are limitations if
what you're trying to do

00:51:50.220 --> 00:51:53.100
is figure out what this
part of the spinal column

00:51:53.100 --> 00:51:55.140
does instead of that
part, because you

00:51:55.140 --> 00:51:57.510
need to figure out-- all
sorts of caveats in there.

00:51:57.510 --> 00:52:00.970
If that's hard, it is a
gazillion times harder

00:52:00.970 --> 00:52:02.700
to use some of these
techniques to make

00:52:02.700 --> 00:52:05.940
sense of emotion and
emotional memories and things

00:52:05.940 --> 00:52:06.600
of that sort.

00:52:06.600 --> 00:52:08.380
What are some of
the difficulties

00:52:08.380 --> 00:52:11.180
in interpreting data from
all the results we just

00:52:11.180 --> 00:52:11.880
heard about?

00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:13.790
Here is one problem.

00:52:13.790 --> 00:52:14.510
OK.

00:52:14.510 --> 00:52:16.740
Every day, unbeknownst
to you guys,

00:52:16.740 --> 00:52:20.210
there are two to three
dozen huge tractor-trailer

00:52:20.210 --> 00:52:22.620
trucks that start
at dawn from Gilroy

00:52:22.620 --> 00:52:26.010
and bring us our garlic that is
used in all of the dorm dining

00:52:26.010 --> 00:52:26.512
rooms.

00:52:26.512 --> 00:52:27.970
Every single morning,
that happens.

00:52:27.970 --> 00:52:30.730
Thousands of pounds that
are consumed in the dorm.

00:52:30.730 --> 00:52:32.640
And you are trying
to understand where

00:52:32.640 --> 00:52:36.750
in California is the
garlic-generating center,

00:52:36.750 --> 00:52:37.940
the garlic nucleus.

00:52:37.940 --> 00:52:39.620
And what you've been
selectively doing

00:52:39.620 --> 00:52:42.630
is carpet-bombing certain
areas in Northern California.

00:52:42.630 --> 00:52:46.000
And, as a result of
a direct hit on 101,

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:48.550
no more garlic shows up
at Leland Stanford Junior

00:52:48.550 --> 00:52:49.750
University.

00:52:49.750 --> 00:52:51.360
So what have you just concluded?

00:52:51.360 --> 00:52:54.520
101, somewhere right
around Laser Quest,

00:52:54.520 --> 00:52:58.160
is exactly where the center
is for producing garlic

00:52:58.160 --> 00:52:59.670
in Northern California.

00:52:59.670 --> 00:53:02.750
And that's the only plausible
scientific conclusion

00:53:02.750 --> 00:53:03.400
you can reach.

00:53:03.400 --> 00:53:06.870
What we have here is
the problem of centers

00:53:06.870 --> 00:53:09.260
versus fibers of passage.

00:53:09.260 --> 00:53:11.710
Have you just, in
a lesion study,

00:53:11.710 --> 00:53:13.760
found out something
about a region?

00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:15.200
You've destroyed
it, and something

00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:16.960
doesn't work normally.

00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:20.900
Is that because you've taken out
the neurons, the cell bodies,

00:53:20.900 --> 00:53:22.010
in the true center?

00:53:22.010 --> 00:53:26.410
Or have you inadvertently
cut a fiber passage?

00:53:26.410 --> 00:53:28.600
Have you blown out 101--

00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:31.620
And endless mistakes
made over the years.

00:53:31.620 --> 00:53:34.030
Early on in neuroanatomy,
people failing

00:53:34.030 --> 00:53:38.420
to distinguish between
lesions of nuclei

00:53:38.420 --> 00:53:40.170
versus lesions of pathways.

00:53:40.170 --> 00:53:42.970
What really winds
up being hard is

00:53:42.970 --> 00:53:46.910
when you have nuclei with cell
bodies and, at the same time,

00:53:46.910 --> 00:53:49.750
fibers passing through
from someplace else.

00:53:49.750 --> 00:53:52.740
That's what this medial
forebrain bundle is about.

00:53:52.740 --> 00:53:55.090
Cell nuclei all
over the place, but,

00:53:55.090 --> 00:53:57.560
at the same time,
fibers passing through.

00:53:57.560 --> 00:53:59.950
When you do a lesion
in a place like that,

00:53:59.950 --> 00:54:03.260
you can't tell whether it's
the cell bodies, the nucleus

00:54:03.260 --> 00:54:06.120
aspects, the center
that you're taking out,

00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:09.400
or whether you have just
taken out a fiber of passage.

00:54:09.400 --> 00:54:12.720
Enormously difficult
stuff to do.

00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:13.260
OK.

00:54:13.260 --> 00:54:14.610
So that's one constraint.

00:54:14.610 --> 00:54:16.880
Once you get through that,
and you've figured out,

00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:19.550
ooh, this really is the
center-- this really

00:54:19.550 --> 00:54:22.700
is the cell bodies, rather
than just the axons--

00:54:22.700 --> 00:54:24.460
then you deal with
this issue of,

00:54:24.460 --> 00:54:27.160
what does a "center"
mean in the brain?

00:54:27.160 --> 00:54:29.360
Yeah, this may be
the center-- the part

00:54:29.360 --> 00:54:32.280
of the brain that moves this
finger instead of this one.

00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:34.076
That may be a pertinent concept.

00:54:34.076 --> 00:54:38.160
Ooh-- this is the center of
the brain for feeling depressed

00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:43.210
amid a bittersweet gratitude
for the unexpected pleasures

00:54:43.210 --> 00:54:46.250
of life, which are felt
in a poignant context,

00:54:46.250 --> 00:54:49.360
making you smell memories of
the kindergarten classroom

00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:49.990
you were in.

00:54:49.990 --> 00:54:50.490
Oh!

00:54:50.490 --> 00:54:52.980
That's the center of the
limbic system for that.

00:54:52.980 --> 00:54:55.710
By the time you're getting
to a part of the brain that's

00:54:55.710 --> 00:54:58.760
doing all this emotional
stuff, intermixed

00:54:58.760 --> 00:55:02.010
with sensory information,
intermixed with memories,

00:55:02.010 --> 00:55:05.640
even the concept of, oh, this
is the part of the brain that

00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:08.430
does fear for you, this is
the part of the brain that

00:55:08.430 --> 00:55:10.510
does aggression--
as we'll see, these

00:55:10.510 --> 00:55:13.460
are some pretty flimsy concepts.

00:55:13.460 --> 00:55:14.130
OK.

00:55:14.130 --> 00:55:15.580
More qualifiers.

00:55:15.580 --> 00:55:17.480
The next thing you
need to be, in order

00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:20.240
to be a good neuroanatomist
and make use of the information

00:55:20.240 --> 00:55:23.370
from these techniques, is
to also be an ethologist.

00:55:23.370 --> 00:55:25.250
We already heard
a version of that.

00:55:25.250 --> 00:55:27.570
The rhinencephalon--
that's what's

00:55:27.570 --> 00:55:30.700
going on a species that's
all about olfaction.

00:55:30.700 --> 00:55:34.330
You can't understand the wiring
going to the limbic system

00:55:34.330 --> 00:55:37.690
unless you have interviewed
an animal in its own language.

00:55:37.690 --> 00:55:39.760
Classic need for ethology.

00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:42.130
OK, so here would be
another demonstration.

00:55:42.130 --> 00:55:44.480
You have found a part
of the brain which

00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:47.260
you think is interesting.

00:55:47.260 --> 00:55:48.460
It's a limbic structure.

00:55:48.460 --> 00:55:50.180
Nobody quite knows what it does.

00:55:50.180 --> 00:55:53.300
And you have now just stuck
a stimulating electrode down

00:55:53.300 --> 00:55:53.866
in there.

00:55:53.866 --> 00:55:55.240
And the strategy
is, you're going

00:55:55.240 --> 00:55:57.470
to mildly stimulate
there, and you see

00:55:57.470 --> 00:55:59.790
what happens in the organism.

00:55:59.790 --> 00:56:01.910
So your first study
subject is a lion,

00:56:01.910 --> 00:56:04.290
and you've stuck your
stimulating electrode down

00:56:04.290 --> 00:56:04.910
in there.

00:56:04.910 --> 00:56:07.070
And you mildly stimulate
this part of the brain.

00:56:07.070 --> 00:56:11.640
And what the lion
does is it does this.

00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:13.590
It extends its claws.

00:56:13.590 --> 00:56:16.780
Now your next
subject is a human.

00:56:16.780 --> 00:56:19.850
So you sit down, you plunk down
your stimulating electrode,

00:56:19.850 --> 00:56:22.500
and you stimulate mildly in
that same part of the brain.

00:56:22.500 --> 00:56:26.410
And the human says "Shit."

00:56:26.410 --> 00:56:29.897
So what part of the brain
have we just found, here?

00:56:29.897 --> 00:56:31.480
We have found a part
of the brain that

00:56:31.480 --> 00:56:35.600
plays a role in expressing a
certain degree of irritation.

00:56:35.600 --> 00:56:37.460
And if you are a
lion, you're sort

00:56:37.460 --> 00:56:39.110
of extending your claws, there.

00:56:39.110 --> 00:56:41.067
You probably want to
stop messing with me,

00:56:41.067 --> 00:56:42.650
because look what
I'm doing right now,

00:56:42.650 --> 00:56:43.940
and look how sharp they are.

00:56:43.940 --> 00:56:45.640
With the human,
another ver-- you've

00:56:45.640 --> 00:56:47.840
got to know your species.

00:56:47.840 --> 00:56:48.922
Another example of this.

00:56:48.922 --> 00:56:50.630
So here's a part of
the brain, and you're

00:56:50.630 --> 00:56:51.880
wondering what's up with this.

00:56:51.880 --> 00:56:53.040
You do the same strategy.

00:56:53.040 --> 00:56:55.030
You stick in the
stimulating electrodes.

00:56:55.030 --> 00:56:57.280
And you do this to a rat.

00:56:57.280 --> 00:57:00.930
And what she does is proceed to
run around her cage like crazy

00:57:00.930 --> 00:57:03.590
and take pieces of newspaper,
rip into little pieces,

00:57:03.590 --> 00:57:06.000
and stuff them in the corner.

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:08.230
OK, that's an interesting
center of the brain.

00:57:08.230 --> 00:57:11.060
Then you do the exact same
thing to a rhesus monkey.

00:57:11.060 --> 00:57:14.400
And what she does is grab any
sort of cylindrical object

00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:18.010
around and hold it in
her arms, by her nipples.

00:57:18.010 --> 00:57:20.690
Oh-- maternal behavior.

00:57:20.690 --> 00:57:23.330
First case, you got
a rat making a nest.

00:57:23.330 --> 00:57:27.050
Second case, you were
stimulating nursing behavior.

00:57:27.050 --> 00:57:27.750
Ah!

00:57:27.750 --> 00:57:30.250
OK, you've got to
translate it into what

00:57:30.250 --> 00:57:32.070
it looks like in the species.

00:57:32.070 --> 00:57:36.340
And here's one domain where that
went utterly, utterly wrong.

00:57:36.340 --> 00:57:39.780
Part of the hypothalamus
which people used to think

00:57:39.780 --> 00:57:42.530
had everything to
do with aggression.

00:57:42.530 --> 00:57:44.640
Because, for example,
here you would

00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:47.990
take a stimulating
electrode in a rat.

00:57:47.990 --> 00:57:51.940
And you put a mouse in
the same cage as the rat.

00:57:51.940 --> 00:57:54.230
And you stimulate that part
of the brain of the rat.

00:57:54.230 --> 00:57:58.510
And the rat leaps on the mouse,
trying to rip it to shreds.

00:57:58.510 --> 00:58:01.460
Now you take a human,
and you stimulate

00:58:01.460 --> 00:58:02.680
that same part of the brain.

00:58:02.680 --> 00:58:06.680
And they leap up and run over to
the cereal box and rip it open

00:58:06.680 --> 00:58:08.320
and start eating.

00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:10.290
What's up with-- oh!

00:58:10.290 --> 00:58:12.470
Rats eat mice.

00:58:12.470 --> 00:58:15.000
That's what the-- that
was not a rat being angry,

00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:17.940
that was a rat getting
something to snack on.

00:58:17.940 --> 00:58:20.800
And you had to recognize
the difference between what

00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:24.160
does aggression look like
in that species versus what

00:58:24.160 --> 00:58:25.530
does food acquisition.

00:58:25.530 --> 00:58:27.710
And if it's a
predatory species, it

00:58:27.710 --> 00:58:30.750
could pass for looking mighty
aggressive and not actually be.

00:58:30.750 --> 00:58:33.310
A whole generation
of people, thinking

00:58:33.310 --> 00:58:36.470
they were understanding the
neurobiology of aggression,

00:58:36.470 --> 00:58:38.650
inadvertently made this
mistake and wound up

00:58:38.650 --> 00:58:41.430
studying the neurobiology
of predatory behavior.

00:58:41.430 --> 00:58:43.520
So you gotta know your species.

00:58:43.520 --> 00:58:45.180
Ethological principles.

00:58:45.180 --> 00:58:48.510
Next, you've got to
know your individual.

00:58:48.510 --> 00:58:51.070
So here, now you've
got two lions,

00:58:51.070 --> 00:58:53.130
and you stick in your
stimulating electrode

00:58:53.130 --> 00:58:54.150
into the first one.

00:58:54.150 --> 00:58:55.660
That same region, again.

00:58:55.660 --> 00:58:59.010
And you stimulate, and he
does the same deal again.

00:58:59.010 --> 00:59:01.250
Or suppose you even
stimulate it more,

00:59:01.250 --> 00:59:03.030
and he does this
a bunch of times,

00:59:03.030 --> 00:59:05.390
and then he roars savagely.

00:59:05.390 --> 00:59:09.410
Meanwhile, you stimulate the
same area in the second lion

00:59:09.410 --> 00:59:12.160
and nothing happens at all.

00:59:12.160 --> 00:59:13.700
You take two baboons.

00:59:13.700 --> 00:59:15.970
You stimulate that
region in the first one,

00:59:15.970 --> 00:59:19.870
and he gives this big threat
yawn, displaying his canines.

00:59:19.870 --> 00:59:22.140
You stimulate it in
the second individual,

00:59:22.140 --> 00:59:25.400
and nothing changes
in his behavior.

00:59:25.400 --> 00:59:26.412
What's the difference?

00:59:26.412 --> 00:59:27.120
Any speculations?

00:59:30.130 --> 00:59:30.630
Dominance.

00:59:30.630 --> 00:59:31.130
Yes!

00:59:31.130 --> 00:59:31.900
Dominance!

00:59:31.900 --> 00:59:33.980
Here, in the second
case-- in the first case,

00:59:33.980 --> 00:59:35.940
you're doing it to a
dominant individual.

00:59:35.940 --> 00:59:39.420
And they do their
fixed action pattern

00:59:39.420 --> 00:59:42.570
for their species of
expressing aggression,

00:59:42.570 --> 00:59:44.000
dominance, whatever.

00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:46.540
But you do it to
some subordinate guy,

00:59:46.540 --> 00:59:49.800
and that's not part of
his repertoire right now.

00:59:49.800 --> 00:59:53.040
And even though that's the
part of the brain that "does"

00:59:53.040 --> 00:59:56.930
that behavior, it is tightly
inhibited in that individual,

00:59:56.930 --> 00:59:58.430
because that's not
an individual who

00:59:58.430 --> 01:00:00.240
goes around
displaying his canines

01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:01.820
to a whole lot of his buddies.

01:00:01.820 --> 01:00:04.870
You have to know the
individual, as well.

01:00:04.870 --> 01:00:06.850
So, given all of
those constraints,

01:00:06.850 --> 01:00:09.117
that tells you, if you're
going to understand what's

01:00:09.117 --> 01:00:11.200
up with this part of the
brain, and the difference

01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:13.680
between fibers and
nuclei, and don't

01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:16.650
get overly impressed with the
notion of centers of function.

01:00:16.650 --> 01:00:19.240
But you gotta do
the ethology stuff.

01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:21.990
Here, more than any
time that we've seen,

01:00:21.990 --> 01:00:25.130
you gotta understand the
species and the individual

01:00:25.130 --> 01:00:27.660
that you are interviewing
with your electrodes.

01:00:27.660 --> 01:00:28.160
OK.

01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:31.390
So, given all of that, what
do some of the limbic system

01:00:31.390 --> 01:00:32.480
structures do?

01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:35.665
This is a first, insanely
simplifying pass,

01:00:35.665 --> 01:00:37.540
because every one of
these areas you're going

01:00:37.540 --> 01:00:39.440
to hear about oh so much more.

01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:40.670
But a very first pass.

01:00:40.670 --> 01:00:42.690
And you notice, as
part of the first pass

01:00:42.690 --> 01:00:44.780
I'm going to be violating
the caveat that I just

01:00:44.780 --> 01:00:47.350
gave two minutes ago, in that,
on this first pass, here,

01:00:47.350 --> 01:00:49.940
I'm going to be presenting
these as the center.

01:00:49.940 --> 01:00:52.540
This is the part of the
brain that does this.

01:00:52.540 --> 01:00:54.660
We're going to see how
totally wrong that is.

01:00:54.660 --> 01:00:56.490
Nonetheless, on a first pass.

01:00:56.490 --> 01:00:57.870
Amygdala.

01:00:57.870 --> 01:01:02.110
Amygdala is centrally
involved in fear and anxiety.

01:01:02.110 --> 01:01:03.880
You know this already.

01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:06.590
Of tremendous
significance, telling us

01:01:06.590 --> 01:01:10.110
something about why this world
is such a messed up place,

01:01:10.110 --> 01:01:14.660
the amygdala also plays a
central role in aggression.

01:01:14.660 --> 01:01:18.000
Not messed up just because, ooh,
this is the part of the brain

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.800
that generates aggression,
but what it tells you is,

01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:25.340
you cannot understand the
neurobiology of being violent

01:01:25.340 --> 01:01:28.400
without understanding the
neurobiology of being afraid

01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:29.770
and being anxious.

01:01:29.770 --> 01:01:32.170
And the fact that this is
the same part of the brain

01:01:32.170 --> 01:01:34.690
that "does" both
of those functions,

01:01:34.690 --> 01:01:37.850
suggesting on a certain
neurobiological level

01:01:37.850 --> 01:01:40.635
in a world in which no
neurons need be afraid,

01:01:40.635 --> 01:01:42.010
you're not going
to be generating

01:01:42.010 --> 01:01:43.890
a whole lot of aggression.

01:01:43.890 --> 01:01:47.200
Also very interestingly,
what we will hear about

01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:53.320
is, the amygdala also plays a
role in male sexual motivation.

01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:56.060
What's that doing, going
through the amygdala?

01:01:56.060 --> 01:01:58.470
Not sure whatsoever,
but what that

01:01:58.470 --> 01:02:02.590
may begin to explain is the
subset of the individuals who

01:02:02.590 --> 01:02:05.710
will confuse aspects
of aggressive behavior

01:02:05.710 --> 01:02:09.530
and sexual behavior in all
sorts of pathological ways.

01:02:09.530 --> 01:02:12.570
First pass of what
the amygdala is about.

01:02:12.570 --> 01:02:16.920
Meanwhile, next door we've
got-- OK, not "next door,"

01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:19.900
but two synapses away--
we've got the septum.

01:02:19.900 --> 01:02:22.370
Showing a first
important example

01:02:22.370 --> 01:02:24.970
of this theme in
the limbic system,

01:02:24.970 --> 01:02:29.140
amygdala mediates aggression.

01:02:29.140 --> 01:02:31.770
Caveats, all of that, we
got the fine print now.

01:02:31.770 --> 01:02:34.880
The septum inhibits aggression.

01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:37.530
It does exactly the
opposite, beginning

01:02:37.530 --> 01:02:40.220
to present a theme
throughout the limbic system

01:02:40.220 --> 01:02:43.480
of different subareas
working in opposition.

01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:47.980
What would you be logically
betting the farm on right now?

01:02:47.980 --> 01:02:52.320
When the amygdala is activated,
it tries to silence the septum.

01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:56.150
When the septum is activated, it
tries to silence the amygdala.

01:02:56.150 --> 01:02:58.880
Cross-inhibitory projections.

01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:00.710
So what would these
things look like?

01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:03.120
You destroy the
amygdala of an animal,

01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:05.460
you never get aggressive
behavior again.

01:03:05.460 --> 01:03:09.360
You record from it when it's
smelling some scary rival.

01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:11.470
The amygdala activates,
you stimulate,

01:03:11.470 --> 01:03:13.360
and it does an
aggressive behavior.

01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:16.150
You could begin to see
how you figure this out.

01:03:16.150 --> 01:03:18.620
Next, hippocampus.

01:03:18.620 --> 01:03:20.800
Hippocampus, famous
for being involved

01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:22.160
in learning and memory.

01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:25.060
Important for us,
as well, hippocampus

01:03:25.060 --> 01:03:29.870
plays a role in turning
off the stress response.

01:03:29.870 --> 01:03:31.900
You remember that
negative-feedback stuff

01:03:31.900 --> 01:03:33.290
from two days ago.

01:03:33.290 --> 01:03:35.020
Every endocrine
system, there's got

01:03:35.020 --> 01:03:36.790
to be a part of the
brain that measures

01:03:36.790 --> 01:03:39.470
the hormone in the bloodstream
to figure out what should

01:03:39.470 --> 01:03:41.220
the hypothalamus be doing.

01:03:41.220 --> 01:03:45.260
The hippocampus measures the
levels of glucocorticoids.

01:03:45.260 --> 01:03:48.330
Why should a part of the
brain that does memory

01:03:48.330 --> 01:03:50.630
be so intertwined with stress?

01:03:50.630 --> 01:03:52.730
Very logical in two ways.

01:03:52.730 --> 01:03:57.410
Number 1, here's a stressful,
horrifying, scary circumstance.

01:03:57.410 --> 01:04:00.310
Remember what you did to
get out of this, if you

01:04:00.310 --> 01:04:02.010
do manage to get out of this.

01:04:02.010 --> 01:04:05.700
File this away very,
very emphatically.

01:04:05.700 --> 01:04:08.950
Second thing that it's good
for is, stressful circumstance

01:04:08.950 --> 01:04:09.490
coming up.

01:04:09.490 --> 01:04:13.510
What did I do last time to
get out of this circumstance?

01:04:13.510 --> 01:04:16.560
So, an intertwining between
a memory part of the brain

01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:20.680
and a relationship with
stress hormone regulation.

01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:23.030
Next, mammillary bodies.

01:04:23.030 --> 01:04:26.400
Has aspects relevant
to maternal behavior.

01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:29.150
And that's not why it was
called the mammillary bodies,

01:04:29.150 --> 01:04:32.380
but they're shaped by,
like, mammary glands.

01:04:32.380 --> 01:04:34.840
If you, once again, don't
spend a whole lot of time

01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:37.750
or look too much at seahorses,
but the mammillary bodies.

01:04:37.750 --> 01:04:40.250
Next, prefrontal cortex.

01:04:40.250 --> 01:04:41.980
You've heard all
about, and we are

01:04:41.980 --> 01:04:44.370
going to hear tons
more about it,

01:04:44.370 --> 01:04:47.660
because it is incredibly
interesting, in terms

01:04:47.660 --> 01:04:51.820
of maturation and learning
appropriate sexual behavior,

01:04:51.820 --> 01:04:54.470
learning not how
to be aggressive

01:04:54.470 --> 01:04:56.670
but when to be aggressive.

01:04:56.670 --> 01:04:58.760
The notion that
there is a problem

01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:01.600
with this part, the anterior
cingulate, in people

01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:03.270
with clinical depression.

01:05:03.270 --> 01:05:04.530
Anterior cingulate.

01:05:04.530 --> 01:05:06.700
I think I may have
referred to this already.

01:05:06.700 --> 01:05:10.640
Sit somebody down, poke
their finger with a needle,

01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:14.340
and areas here are going to
light up in spinal pathways,

01:05:14.340 --> 01:05:16.020
telling you it was
this finger and not

01:05:16.020 --> 01:05:19.940
that one and areas making you
breathe faster and all of that.

01:05:19.940 --> 01:05:24.500
And, in addition, the anterior
cingulate is going to activate.

01:05:24.500 --> 01:05:28.510
Take somebody now and have
them watch their loved one get

01:05:28.510 --> 01:05:30.310
their finger poked
with a needle,

01:05:30.310 --> 01:05:32.870
and nothing's
happening down here.

01:05:32.870 --> 01:05:35.850
But the anterior
cingulate activates.

01:05:35.850 --> 01:05:40.450
It's doing something
along the lines of empathy

01:05:40.450 --> 01:05:42.900
and feeling somebody
else's pain.

01:05:42.900 --> 01:05:45.420
And suddenly it becomes
real interesting

01:05:45.420 --> 01:05:49.120
that there's stuff going wrong
in it in clinical depression.

01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:51.620
Easily translated
into, that that

01:05:51.620 --> 01:05:56.320
is a disease of pathological
hypersensitivity to the pains

01:05:56.320 --> 01:05:58.460
of life and the world.

01:05:58.460 --> 01:06:00.100
OK, so, frontal cortex.

01:06:00.100 --> 01:06:03.830
Finally, lurking around in
here, the ventral tegmental area

01:06:03.830 --> 01:06:05.520
and the nucleus accumbens.

01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:08.680
Really pertinent to
depression, as well.

01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:10.820
This is the part
of the brain that

01:06:10.820 --> 01:06:14.020
has all the neurons
that release dopamine,

01:06:14.020 --> 01:06:16.500
having to do with pleasure.

01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:19.830
This is the part of the
brain that cocaine works on--

01:06:19.830 --> 01:06:22.870
that, indirectly, all
addictive drugs work on.

01:06:22.870 --> 01:06:26.060
This is the part-- stimulates
dopamine release here,

01:06:26.060 --> 01:06:29.720
stimulates dopamine release at
all the interesting places--

01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:32.950
frontal cortex,
amygdala, hippocampus--

01:06:32.950 --> 01:06:36.000
central to
understanding everything

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:39.490
about appetitive
behavior-- behavior driven

01:06:39.490 --> 01:06:41.630
by an appetite for something.

01:06:41.630 --> 01:06:43.660
That tells us an
elaboration we'll

01:06:43.660 --> 01:06:46.720
be learning about, in terms of
what the dopamine system, here,

01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:47.370
does.

01:06:47.370 --> 01:06:49.500
People used to think
this is the system

01:06:49.500 --> 01:06:53.190
that activates when you
are feeling pleasure.

01:06:53.190 --> 01:06:55.790
Turns out it does something
much more interesting.

01:06:55.790 --> 01:06:58.650
This is the part of the brain
that activates when you're

01:06:58.650 --> 01:07:01.480
anticipating feeling pleasure.

01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:03.630
It's not about
getting the reward.

01:07:03.630 --> 01:07:07.600
It's about anticipating
that you will get a reward.

01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:10.630
And what it's most
about is not only

01:07:10.630 --> 01:07:13.270
anticipating that
you may get a reward

01:07:13.270 --> 01:07:17.560
but powering the behavior
you need to do in order

01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:19.280
to get the reward.

01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:21.820
Standard paradigm
showing this-- you take

01:07:21.820 --> 01:07:23.450
a monkey that's been trained.

01:07:23.450 --> 01:07:26.920
Every time a light comes on,
at that point if it presses

01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:31.710
a lever 10 times, five-second
delay and out comes some food.

01:07:31.710 --> 01:07:33.210
That reward system.

01:07:33.210 --> 01:07:35.370
Initially, the
very first time it

01:07:35.370 --> 01:07:37.860
stumbles into just happening
to hit this out of boredom

01:07:37.860 --> 01:07:39.870
10 times and out
comes some food.

01:07:39.870 --> 01:07:42.790
Ooh, up go dopamine levels
when the food comes out.

01:07:42.790 --> 01:07:45.490
But pretty soon,
what you get instead,

01:07:45.490 --> 01:07:49.670
the dopamine levels go up
when the light first comes on.

01:07:49.670 --> 01:07:52.960
This is not, ooh, I just
got some pleasurable food,

01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:55.255
this is, I know this one.

01:07:55.255 --> 01:07:56.370
I'm on top of this.

01:07:56.370 --> 01:07:57.770
I'm all over this one.

01:07:57.770 --> 01:07:58.710
This one's easy.

01:07:58.710 --> 01:08:00.980
This is one of those
10-lever-press deals.

01:08:00.980 --> 01:08:02.380
This is going to be great.

01:08:02.380 --> 01:08:04.090
I got this under control.

01:08:04.090 --> 01:08:06.480
Elevated dopamine,
you go hit the lever

01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:08.420
and along comes the food.

01:08:08.420 --> 01:08:11.702
Now, instead, you
flash on the signal,

01:08:11.702 --> 01:08:14.160
telling you we're entering one
of those "press the lever 10

01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:15.870
times, you get food" sessions.

01:08:15.870 --> 01:08:19.680
You turn that on, and you
block the rise in dopamine.

01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:22.640
And the animal doesn't
press the lever.

01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:25.859
What this pathway is
about is giving you

01:08:25.859 --> 01:08:29.689
the energy, the motivation,
the depolarization

01:08:29.689 --> 01:08:33.410
of neurons for carrying out
the pursuit of pleasure.

01:08:33.410 --> 01:08:36.890
And that's really
informative, as we'll see.

01:08:36.890 --> 01:08:40.020
Because stimulating
the pursuit of pleasure

01:08:40.020 --> 01:08:42.970
is far more of an addictive
process than the pleasure

01:08:42.970 --> 01:08:46.390
itself, in terms of making
sense of some of the circuitry.

01:08:46.390 --> 01:08:47.020
OK.

01:08:47.020 --> 01:08:50.710
So all of this eventually plunks
us down into the hypothalamus.

01:08:50.710 --> 01:08:53.930
The hypothalamus has
a gazillion subareas,

01:08:53.930 --> 01:08:56.200
all these separate
little nuclei that

01:08:56.200 --> 01:08:59.300
have a variety of
functions, all of which

01:08:59.300 --> 01:09:02.109
have boring, vegetative,
just keeping track

01:09:02.109 --> 01:09:05.359
of body temperature type
functions, all of which

01:09:05.359 --> 01:09:09.430
are also profoundly affected
by the whole world of emotion

01:09:09.430 --> 01:09:10.720
and thought and memory.

01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:11.770
First area.

01:09:11.770 --> 01:09:13.750
Ventromedial hypothalamus.

01:09:13.750 --> 01:09:16.779
We're going to hear tons about
that, starting next week,

01:09:16.779 --> 01:09:20.920
along with a cognate area,
the medial preoptic area.

01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:22.740
These terms will
become familiar.

01:09:22.740 --> 01:09:24.010
Do not freak out.

01:09:24.010 --> 01:09:27.689
These areas are very
pertinent to sexual behavior.

01:09:27.689 --> 01:09:30.939
And what we will see
is that one of them

01:09:30.939 --> 01:09:33.330
is more involved in
male sexual behavior,

01:09:33.330 --> 01:09:37.010
one more in female sexual
behavior, on the average.

01:09:37.010 --> 01:09:40.830
There are gender differences
in the size of these areas.

01:09:40.830 --> 01:09:45.254
There is one landmark study
that everybody learned about,

01:09:45.254 --> 01:09:47.590
about 15 years ago,
showing that there's

01:09:47.590 --> 01:09:50.479
a difference in the size
of one of these regions,

01:09:50.479 --> 01:09:53.130
depending on your
sexual orientation.

01:09:53.130 --> 01:09:55.620
There is an amazing
study that was

01:09:55.620 --> 01:09:58.320
shown that people
who are transgender

01:09:58.320 --> 01:10:01.360
have differences in the size
of some of these regions

01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:05.600
as a function not of what
their sexual phenotype is

01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:08.790
but of what they've always said
"I have always felt like a"

01:10:08.790 --> 01:10:09.610
whatever.

01:10:09.610 --> 01:10:13.380
They have the region the
size of the "what I always

01:10:13.380 --> 01:10:16.310
felt like I was" rather
than what they actually

01:10:16.310 --> 01:10:18.320
are, bringing in
this possibility

01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:21.740
that what transgender is
about is not somebody thinking

01:10:21.740 --> 01:10:24.250
that they have the wrong
sex, but it's somebody

01:10:24.250 --> 01:10:26.040
who's gotten the wrong body.

01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:29.140
So these areas, we're going
to hear lots about next week.

01:10:29.140 --> 01:10:32.760
Next region-- SCN--
suprachiasmatic nucleus.

01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:36.680
And once Julie Andrews says that
as loud and fast as possible.

01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:40.440
The suprachiasmatic nucleus
is about circadian rhythms.

01:10:40.440 --> 01:10:42.560
We're mostly going
to ignore that.

01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:45.170
And anybody who has anything
to do with Craig Heller's lab,

01:10:45.170 --> 01:10:47.540
don't tell him that
I said that, either.

01:10:47.540 --> 01:10:51.405
But it's like-- stupid
circadian rhythms in fish,

01:10:51.405 --> 01:10:53.900
sort of doing two of
my colleagues at once.

01:10:53.900 --> 01:10:55.630
Next-- moving on.

01:10:55.630 --> 01:10:57.340
Another part of
the hypothalamus.

01:10:57.340 --> 01:11:00.440
PVN-- paraventricular nucleus.

01:11:00.440 --> 01:11:02.260
What's made in there?

01:11:02.260 --> 01:11:03.670
CRH.

01:11:03.670 --> 01:11:05.510
That's the part
of the brain that

01:11:05.510 --> 01:11:08.280
initiates the backbone
of the stress response.

01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:11.600
And what areas are
sending projections to it?

01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:12.890
Everything.

01:11:12.890 --> 01:11:16.690
Everything ranging from pathways
that tell you that you've just

01:11:16.690 --> 01:11:19.520
burned your toe, to
pathways telling you

01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:22.410
are very, very hungry,
to pathways telling you

01:11:22.410 --> 01:11:26.580
that you've just smelled a
terrifying territorial rival,

01:11:26.580 --> 01:11:30.400
to pathways telling you you have
just thought about, oh my god,

01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:33.500
only four days till the
midterm, or whatever it is.

01:11:33.500 --> 01:11:35.230
By the time you
get to species that

01:11:35.230 --> 01:11:38.890
can be stressed by very
abstract cognitive states

01:11:38.890 --> 01:11:41.030
by thinking about the
suffering of somebody

01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:43.260
on the other side of
the planet, what do we

01:11:43.260 --> 01:11:44.870
know about the neuroanatomy?

01:11:44.870 --> 01:11:49.280
PVN is getting projections
from all over the place.

01:11:49.280 --> 01:11:51.670
Next, arcuate nucleus.

01:11:51.670 --> 01:11:55.690
Arcuate nucleus is the bottom
of the hypothalamic funnel.

01:11:55.690 --> 01:11:58.940
That's the part where all
of the hypothalamic hormones

01:11:58.940 --> 01:12:02.220
come out and get into the
circulatory system there.

01:12:02.220 --> 01:12:04.100
There's actually another
area on top of that.

01:12:04.100 --> 01:12:06.290
I will not mention it,
but that's its function.

01:12:06.290 --> 01:12:10.340
Lateral hypothalamus has
something to do with hunger.

01:12:10.340 --> 01:12:13.460
And that's the area
that people wasted years

01:12:13.460 --> 01:12:15.370
on thinking they were
studying aggression

01:12:15.370 --> 01:12:18.100
when they were instead
studying predatory behavior.

01:12:18.100 --> 01:12:21.410
Lateral hypothalamus
has to do with hunger.

01:12:21.410 --> 01:12:23.940
Boring version of
it, it does things

01:12:23.940 --> 01:12:26.330
like measure your
blood glucose levels

01:12:26.330 --> 01:12:30.030
and your insulin levels--
all sorts of logical things.

01:12:30.030 --> 01:12:32.520
Really interesting
level, evidence

01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:34.150
that the lateral
hypothalamus has

01:12:34.150 --> 01:12:37.960
something to do with hungers
in the broader sense.

01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:40.690
Hungers for types
of information.

01:12:40.690 --> 01:12:43.500
Hungers for other
rewards other than food.

01:12:43.500 --> 01:12:46.590
It's an area having
to do with hunger.

01:12:46.590 --> 01:12:47.240
OK.

01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:51.070
So this very, very fast
pass here over all of it.

01:12:51.070 --> 01:12:53.380
One additional component
to think about,

01:12:53.380 --> 01:12:54.980
which is, everything
I've just said

01:12:54.980 --> 01:12:59.190
has been oriented around all
this limbic-system stuff, built

01:12:59.190 --> 01:13:02.490
around eventually
influencing the hypothalamus

01:13:02.490 --> 01:13:07.260
and thus eventually influencing
the entire world of hormones

01:13:07.260 --> 01:13:10.010
or of the autonomic
nervous system.

01:13:10.010 --> 01:13:12.300
This is this
unidirectional picture.

01:13:12.300 --> 01:13:15.280
Stuff starts in the
brain, and you have

01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:16.840
outcomes throughout the body.

01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:19.740
What is just as important
is, all the ways

01:13:19.740 --> 01:13:21.920
in which stuff
going on in the body

01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:25.900
will influence limbic function,
completing this circle.

01:13:25.900 --> 01:13:28.380
And an awful lot
of that information

01:13:28.380 --> 01:13:32.530
is the autonomic nervous system
not going in this direction

01:13:32.530 --> 01:13:34.490
but going in this direction.

01:13:34.490 --> 01:13:38.080
Now what this brings
up is a classic theory

01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:40.450
that's been in psychology
since around 1900

01:13:40.450 --> 01:13:44.020
or so called the James-Lange
theory of emotion,

01:13:44.020 --> 01:13:47.920
named for William James and
Lange-- whoever that was.

01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:49.500
That may have been his puppy.

01:13:49.500 --> 01:13:53.830
But the James-Lange theory
of emotion goes as follows.

01:13:53.830 --> 01:13:55.800
Here's how you feel an emotion.

01:13:55.800 --> 01:13:59.610
It is not the case
that your brain decides

01:13:59.610 --> 01:14:03.090
it's feeling an emotion based on
sensory information coming in,

01:14:03.090 --> 01:14:04.200
memory, whatever.

01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:07.920
The brain decides it's feeling
an emotion and tells the body,

01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:10.480
let's speed up the heart,
let's breathe faster,

01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:12.030
let's sweat-- whatever it is.

01:14:12.030 --> 01:14:14.010
That's not how emotion works.

01:14:14.010 --> 01:14:15.480
Here's how emotion works.

01:14:15.480 --> 01:14:19.240
Stimulus comes into your brain,
and before you consciously

01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:23.270
process it your body
is already responding--

01:14:23.270 --> 01:14:25.250
with heart rate,
with blood pressure,

01:14:25.250 --> 01:14:27.700
with pupillary
contractions-- whatever.

01:14:27.700 --> 01:14:30.980
How do you figure out what
emotion you are feeling?

01:14:30.980 --> 01:14:34.190
You are getting information
back from the periphery,

01:14:34.190 --> 01:14:36.730
telling you what's
going on down there.

01:14:36.730 --> 01:14:39.630
In other words, how do you
figure out you're excited?

01:14:39.630 --> 01:14:40.440
Whoa!

01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:42.540
If I'm suddenly
breathing real fast,

01:14:42.540 --> 01:14:44.190
and my heart's
beating fast, it must

01:14:44.190 --> 01:14:47.930
be because I feel ex--
oh, I feel excited now.

01:14:47.930 --> 01:14:49.080
Ridiculous.

01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:52.150
Totally absurd way in which
you could process stuff.

01:14:52.150 --> 01:14:53.530
Completely inefficient.

01:14:53.530 --> 01:14:55.600
And over the years,
after decades

01:14:55.600 --> 01:14:58.800
of being wildly discredited,
more and more evidence

01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:03.180
that that is some of how emotion
is based-- your brain being

01:15:03.180 --> 01:15:06.500
influenced by your bodily
state to decide what

01:15:06.500 --> 01:15:07.900
emotions it's feeling.

01:15:07.900 --> 01:15:10.450
A number of examples.

01:15:10.450 --> 01:15:11.250
First one.

01:15:11.250 --> 01:15:13.840
Ones of those hormones that
just has "emotion" written

01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:15.820
all over it-- adrenaline.

01:15:15.820 --> 01:15:17.680
Adrenaline, epinephrine.

01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:20.010
Epinephrine,
associated with arousal

01:15:20.010 --> 01:15:22.290
of the sympathetic
nervous system.

01:15:22.290 --> 01:15:25.650
So what happens when you
dump some epinephrine

01:15:25.650 --> 01:15:26.870
into the nervous system?

01:15:26.870 --> 01:15:28.250
What does it do to the brain?

01:15:28.250 --> 01:15:29.960
What does it do to
the limbic system?

01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:32.890
What does it do to the sort
of behaviors influenced by it?

01:15:32.890 --> 01:15:35.960
And, greatest demonstration--
this was a classic study

01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:38.490
in the '60s-- guy named
Stanley Schachter doing

01:15:38.490 --> 01:15:41.640
a study that you could
not do again on humans,

01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:42.810
with current rules.

01:15:42.810 --> 01:15:43.820
But here's what he did.

01:15:43.820 --> 01:15:46.430
He gave people
epinephrine, adrenaline,

01:15:46.430 --> 01:15:49.350
without them knowing it.

01:15:49.350 --> 01:15:52.130
OK, less paperwork
in those days.

01:15:52.130 --> 01:15:55.450
But here's what the one version
of the classic experiment was.

01:15:55.450 --> 01:15:57.660
Somebody comes in,
and they believe

01:15:57.660 --> 01:16:01.800
what they're doing is some
study of, you take this vitamin

01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:05.710
and does it change the way
you do Sudoku or something.

01:16:05.710 --> 01:16:07.380
Like, that was just the teaser.

01:16:07.380 --> 01:16:08.710
That was the distracter.

01:16:08.710 --> 01:16:11.940
You've taken this pill
which actually contained

01:16:11.940 --> 01:16:14.280
long-acting epinephrine.

01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:16.350
Then you're going to go
into the study, where

01:16:16.350 --> 01:16:18.670
you're going to get tested
or whatever the task is.

01:16:18.670 --> 01:16:21.170
And please sit down in the
waiting room for a while.

01:16:21.170 --> 01:16:24.780
And the actual experiment took
place in the waiting room.

01:16:24.780 --> 01:16:26.190
Sitting there in
the waiting room

01:16:26.190 --> 01:16:28.650
was another individual,
a confederate

01:16:28.650 --> 01:16:31.140
of Schachter-- somebody
working on the experiment.

01:16:31.140 --> 01:16:33.540
In half the cases,
what the person sitting

01:16:33.540 --> 01:16:36.911
there was supposed to do
was say, I can't believe it!

01:16:36.911 --> 01:16:39.410
I was supposed to go, and they
said I would have a 1 o'clock

01:16:39.410 --> 01:16:40.284
appointment for this.

01:16:40.284 --> 01:16:41.776
It is 1:30 already.

01:16:41.776 --> 01:16:42.900
I'm going to miss my class.

01:16:42.900 --> 01:16:44.108
My car is going to get towed.

01:16:44.108 --> 01:16:45.280
I'm totally pissed off.

01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:47.030
I can't believe these
people are doing it.

01:16:47.030 --> 01:16:49.500
Meanwhile, half the
time the other person

01:16:49.500 --> 01:16:53.160
is sitting there saying, god,
I love these psych studies!

01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:54.160
Do you do a lot of them?

01:16:54.160 --> 01:16:55.170
I love doing these ones!

01:16:55.170 --> 01:16:56.510
I had such a cool one last week.

01:16:56.510 --> 01:16:57.900
Which dorm are you in?

01:16:57.900 --> 01:17:00.490
Let's-- and off it goes.

01:17:00.490 --> 01:17:04.380
The key thing being, totally
different emotional states

01:17:04.380 --> 01:17:06.260
and each case being
exposed to someone

01:17:06.260 --> 01:17:11.100
in a very emotionally aroused,
agitated, expressive state.

01:17:11.100 --> 01:17:12.990
And what did Schachter show?

01:17:12.990 --> 01:17:16.010
Does epinephrine make
you get more angry?

01:17:16.010 --> 01:17:18.660
Does epinephrine make
you get more friendly?

01:17:18.660 --> 01:17:20.000
It doesn't do either.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:21.770
It's modulatory.

01:17:21.770 --> 01:17:24.490
What epinephrine
does is it kicks up

01:17:24.490 --> 01:17:27.140
the fevered level
of whatever emotion

01:17:27.140 --> 01:17:29.410
you are socially
being brought into.

01:17:29.410 --> 01:17:33.250
And thus what you got was the
subject sitting there, soaked

01:17:33.250 --> 01:17:35.620
in epinephrine, while
somebody is, like, going on

01:17:35.620 --> 01:17:38.460
about how late it is, and these
people-- before you know it,

01:17:38.460 --> 01:17:41.830
they're up there, banging on
the counter at the receptionist

01:17:41.830 --> 01:17:44.161
and saying, this is an
outrage, and this is unfair,

01:17:44.161 --> 01:17:45.910
and all of that--
getting caught up in it.

01:17:45.910 --> 01:17:47.860
Meanwhile, the other
one, within, like,

01:17:47.860 --> 01:17:50.012
five minutes, he's
singing frat songs

01:17:50.012 --> 01:17:51.720
with this person
[INAUDIBLE], and they're

01:17:51.720 --> 01:17:52.960
going to get
together for dinner,

01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:54.300
and they're hugging each other.

01:17:54.300 --> 01:17:56.150
And what does epinephrine do?

01:17:56.150 --> 01:18:02.000
It does not cause a behavior,
it exaggerates, it magnifies,

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:05.650
emotional states that have been
provoked for other reasons.

01:18:05.650 --> 01:18:06.650
It modulates.

01:18:06.650 --> 01:18:09.600
The exact same concept
as the other day-- what

01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:12.180
does GABAA do to that neuron A?

01:18:12.180 --> 01:18:13.660
It does nothing whatsoever.

01:18:13.660 --> 01:18:17.380
What GABAA does is it
modulates the ability

01:18:17.380 --> 01:18:19.720
of this glutamatergic
neuron to talk to A.

01:18:19.720 --> 01:18:21.160
What does epinephrine do?

01:18:21.160 --> 01:18:23.210
Does it create any emotions?

01:18:23.210 --> 01:18:24.210
Not at all.

01:18:24.210 --> 01:18:28.070
What it does is jack up the
intensity of whatever emotions

01:18:28.070 --> 01:18:31.210
your social circumstances
have generated.

01:18:31.210 --> 01:18:34.610
Another example of
James-Lange sort of stuff.

01:18:34.610 --> 01:18:35.260
OK.

01:18:35.260 --> 01:18:38.030
So you were sitting around,
and you were terribly anxious,

01:18:38.030 --> 01:18:39.620
and you go to a clinician.

01:18:39.620 --> 01:18:42.900
And the person decides to
give you-- what class of drugs

01:18:42.900 --> 01:18:44.350
do we know endlessly by now?

01:18:44.350 --> 01:18:45.830
Benzodiazepines.

01:18:45.830 --> 01:18:49.060
They give you some Valium
to decrease your anxiety.

01:18:49.060 --> 01:18:51.720
Meanwhile, across
town, there's somebody

01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:55.120
who has a big gymnastics
competition on Sunday--

01:18:55.120 --> 01:18:55.910
whatever.

01:18:55.910 --> 01:18:57.140
And they've pulled a muscle.

01:18:57.140 --> 01:18:58.690
They've been having
muscle spasms,

01:18:58.690 --> 01:19:00.540
and this is really a problem.

01:19:00.540 --> 01:19:02.100
So they go to their
clinician, who

01:19:02.100 --> 01:19:06.320
gives them a muscle
relaxant-- Benzodiazepines--

01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:08.080
the exact same dose.

01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:08.940
So, wait a second.

01:19:08.940 --> 01:19:11.860
Here's somebody taking
Valium for anxiety,

01:19:11.860 --> 01:19:15.460
and here's somebody taking
Valium to relax their muscles.

01:19:15.460 --> 01:19:16.840
What's up with that?

01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:18.890
It's the exact same thing.

01:19:18.890 --> 01:19:21.660
And it is a very
James-Lange moment.

01:19:21.660 --> 01:19:24.220
What's part of anxiety about?

01:19:24.220 --> 01:19:28.020
It's monitoring the level
of tension in your body.

01:19:28.020 --> 01:19:30.780
It's getting feedback
from muscle tone.

01:19:30.780 --> 01:19:34.460
And that's one of the ways
in which antianxiety drugs

01:19:34.460 --> 01:19:36.090
like benzodiazepines work.

01:19:36.090 --> 01:19:39.590
Because you're sitting there,
and you're saying things

01:19:39.590 --> 01:19:42.070
are just as horrible as
they were an hour ago!

01:19:42.070 --> 01:19:43.660
But I am so relaxed.

01:19:43.660 --> 01:19:45.690
I'm, like, dripping out
of this chair, here.

01:19:45.690 --> 01:19:48.170
It must not be so bad.

01:19:48.170 --> 01:19:51.860
Part of you deciding is
monitoring the muscle tone

01:19:51.860 --> 01:19:55.860
in your body, coming back
with autonomic information.

01:19:55.860 --> 01:19:57.560
That's where you
break the cycle.

01:19:57.560 --> 01:20:00.510
That's why the same
drug decreases anxiety

01:20:00.510 --> 01:20:02.880
and is a muscle relaxant.

01:20:02.880 --> 01:20:04.560
More examples of this.

01:20:04.560 --> 01:20:07.840
One is, what's going
on with meditation?

01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:10.696
That's what
biofeedback taps into.

01:20:10.696 --> 01:20:12.570
So you're sitting there,
and you're suffering

01:20:12.570 --> 01:20:14.050
from high blood pressure.

01:20:14.050 --> 01:20:17.190
Translated into our
terms, something here

01:20:17.190 --> 01:20:20.280
is driving blood pressure
to be increased too much.

01:20:20.280 --> 01:20:21.390
It's not necessarily that.

01:20:21.390 --> 01:20:22.810
It could also be blood vessels.

01:20:22.810 --> 01:20:25.730
But we'll put it on a brain
basis, here, for the moment.

01:20:25.730 --> 01:20:29.170
So you've got a choice
between taking drugs or doing

01:20:29.170 --> 01:20:30.760
some meditational
something that you

01:20:30.760 --> 01:20:34.360
want to hook up to biofeedback,
to make it more effective.

01:20:34.360 --> 01:20:35.330
Here's what you do.

01:20:35.330 --> 01:20:38.220
They sit you down,
and they wire you

01:20:38.220 --> 01:20:40.350
up so that they can monitor
your blood pressure.

01:20:40.350 --> 01:20:41.170
And you sit there.

01:20:41.170 --> 01:20:45.490
And they say, OK, I want you
to relax and focus, and focus

01:20:45.490 --> 01:20:48.752
on the best day of your life.

01:20:48.752 --> 01:20:50.460
Let's see what happens
to blood pressure.

01:20:50.460 --> 01:20:51.140
Nothing much.

01:20:51.140 --> 01:20:54.140
OK, focus on your
favorite piece of music.

01:20:54.140 --> 01:20:54.720
Nothing much.

01:20:54.720 --> 01:20:57.290
OK, focus on your favorite
piece of music that's

01:20:57.290 --> 01:20:59.330
kind of slow and dreamy--

01:20:59.330 --> 01:21:01.370
And suddenly the
monitor goes this way.

01:21:01.370 --> 01:21:04.400
The person's blood pressure
has just dropped 10 points.

01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:06.570
And then you say,
stop, wait a second--

01:21:06.570 --> 01:21:08.570
what did you just think about?

01:21:08.570 --> 01:21:10.100
Think about it again.

01:21:10.100 --> 01:21:11.590
And it does it again.

01:21:11.590 --> 01:21:14.120
And what the person begins
to learn at this point

01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:17.650
is, what aspects of
meditative states,

01:21:17.650 --> 01:21:19.770
what aspects of
memory-- whatever--

01:21:19.770 --> 01:21:24.690
suddenly allow the brain to
be regulating blood pressure.

01:21:24.690 --> 01:21:26.410
What's going on there?

01:21:26.410 --> 01:21:30.130
You're using this machine
to send the signal up there.

01:21:30.130 --> 01:21:33.020
Part of what's also going
on is feedback that way.

01:21:33.020 --> 01:21:35.810
So, another version
of one of these loops.

01:21:35.810 --> 01:21:37.390
More versions of loops.

01:21:37.390 --> 01:21:39.240
Here's one that
probably accounts

01:21:39.240 --> 01:21:42.510
for 90% of the arguments
between significant others

01:21:42.510 --> 01:21:43.700
on this planet.

01:21:43.700 --> 01:21:44.300
OK.

01:21:44.300 --> 01:21:46.110
So you and your
significant other

01:21:46.110 --> 01:21:51.100
are behaving, interacting in a
primate social biological way.

01:21:51.100 --> 01:21:53.020
And one of you
does something that

01:21:53.020 --> 01:21:55.470
totally outrages the other one.

01:21:55.470 --> 01:21:58.890
And they're furious at
you-- he says, personifying.

01:21:58.890 --> 01:22:00.576
And they're furious.

01:22:00.576 --> 01:22:03.770
And what's going on-- and
they convince you readily

01:22:03.770 --> 01:22:05.340
that you're at
fault and, in fact,

01:22:05.340 --> 01:22:07.040
this was a horrible
thing you did.

01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:08.860
And they're all agitated.

01:22:08.860 --> 01:22:11.700
And you apologize, and you make
it sound like you really mean

01:22:11.700 --> 01:22:13.280
it, because you really mean it.

01:22:13.280 --> 01:22:14.810
And you apologize, and great.

01:22:14.810 --> 01:22:17.690
And they finally say OK,
OK, I accept your apology.

01:22:17.690 --> 01:22:18.940
Don't do it again.

01:22:18.940 --> 01:22:20.100
It's all sorted out.

01:22:20.100 --> 01:22:20.880
It's over with.

01:22:20.880 --> 01:22:21.810
It's done.

01:22:21.810 --> 01:22:24.027
And then you begin
to think, OK great,

01:22:24.027 --> 01:22:25.860
we're out the other end
of the woods, there.

01:22:25.860 --> 01:22:27.100
Things are just fine now.

01:22:27.100 --> 01:22:27.600
Things are--

01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:31.330
And suddenly they remember
something miserable

01:22:31.330 --> 01:22:33.950
you did to them in 1968!

01:22:33.950 --> 01:22:36.940
And they suddenly remembered
in every possible detail

01:22:36.940 --> 01:22:39.680
and want to argue about
it all over again!

01:22:39.680 --> 01:22:41.580
What's going on there?

01:22:41.580 --> 01:22:45.080
What we have is another
James-Lange moment,

01:22:45.080 --> 01:22:48.840
when you get into
aroused, angry state,

01:22:48.840 --> 01:22:51.160
and then it's all
over with, afterward.

01:22:51.160 --> 01:22:54.010
That's great, because the
person has apologized.

01:22:54.010 --> 01:22:56.120
So, cognitively, you
have just adjusted

01:22:56.120 --> 01:22:59.720
things-- yes, they recognize
they did the wrong thing.

01:22:59.720 --> 01:23:01.970
Good, I'm vindicated,
that's great.

01:23:01.970 --> 01:23:02.830
It's settled now.

01:23:02.830 --> 01:23:03.780
It's perfect.

01:23:03.780 --> 01:23:05.910
And you could do
that in a second.

01:23:05.910 --> 01:23:08.350
The trouble is, it
takes a long time.

01:23:08.350 --> 01:23:11.860
It takes minutes, now, for
your sympathetic nervous system

01:23:11.860 --> 01:23:15.140
and its consequences to
completely coast back

01:23:15.140 --> 01:23:16.330
to baseline.

01:23:16.330 --> 01:23:19.180
So you're sitting there, and
the problem has been solved,

01:23:19.180 --> 01:23:21.210
but your heart is still racing.

01:23:21.210 --> 01:23:22.450
And what do you have?

01:23:22.450 --> 01:23:25.470
A James-Lange moment, there,
sitting there, saying,

01:23:25.470 --> 01:23:28.350
OK, well, I was really
upset about that.

01:23:28.350 --> 01:23:30.880
But that's just sorted out,
and that's all taken care of.

01:23:30.880 --> 01:23:34.180
Except I'm still feeling
totally agitated!

01:23:34.180 --> 01:23:35.750
It must be for some reason.

01:23:35.750 --> 01:23:36.400
Oh!

01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:39.080
It's what that person did to
me in the second Roosevelt

01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:39.850
administration!

01:23:39.850 --> 01:23:41.730
And suddenly out it comes out.

01:23:41.730 --> 01:23:44.070
It's this James-Lange
loop, there,

01:23:44.070 --> 01:23:48.200
of the physiological
information coming back there,

01:23:48.200 --> 01:23:51.210
prompting one into
trying to find

01:23:51.210 --> 01:23:53.530
a cognitive explanation for it.

01:23:53.530 --> 01:23:58.460
There must be a reason why I
am still hyperventi-- oh, this

01:23:58.460 --> 01:23:59.710
must be the reason.

01:23:59.710 --> 01:24:01.850
This thing we need
to go over, also.

01:24:01.850 --> 01:24:02.350
OK.

01:24:02.350 --> 01:24:04.800
I am going to give
you one factoid, here,

01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:06.720
and you can do with
it what you will.

01:24:06.720 --> 01:24:10.300
But there is a pronounced
gender difference in how long

01:24:10.300 --> 01:24:13.720
it takes after strong
sympathetic arousal for things

01:24:13.720 --> 01:24:15.540
to go back to baseline.

01:24:15.540 --> 01:24:16.360
[LAUGHTER]

01:24:16.360 --> 01:24:18.370
OK, let's just get a
show of hands, here.

01:24:18.370 --> 01:24:19.900
[LAUGHTER]

01:24:19.900 --> 01:24:22.390
Who guesses that it
takes longer to get back

01:24:22.390 --> 01:24:25.968
to baseline in males?

01:24:25.968 --> 01:24:27.760
[LAUGHTER]

01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:31.120
OK, well, unless there's a
lot of abstainers here I think

01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:32.832
we're-- OK, females?

01:24:32.832 --> 01:24:33.650
Yeah.

01:24:33.650 --> 01:24:34.420
Yes!

01:24:34.420 --> 01:24:37.520
There is a pronounced
gender difference in that.

01:24:37.520 --> 01:24:39.250
And there's another
realm in which

01:24:39.250 --> 01:24:41.540
you have that same pronounced
gender difference, which

01:24:41.540 --> 01:24:43.540
is after orgasm.

01:24:43.540 --> 01:24:48.400
Males go back to baseline a
lot faster than females do.

01:24:48.400 --> 01:24:51.325
And that explains a whole
world of, like, you know,

01:24:51.325 --> 01:24:54.940
he wants to go out and get
noodles in peanut sauce,

01:24:54.940 --> 01:24:57.659
and she wants to
cuddle and talk to him

01:24:57.659 --> 01:24:58.825
and all that sort of thing--

01:24:58.825 --> 01:24:59.325
[LAUGHTER]

01:24:59.325 --> 01:25:00.740
--and [INAUDIBLE].

01:25:00.740 --> 01:25:05.320
And it's James-Lange's damn
fault that that sort of thing

01:25:05.320 --> 01:25:05.820
goes on.

01:25:05.820 --> 01:25:06.320
OK.

01:25:06.320 --> 01:25:08.060
So we, there, have
another example

01:25:08.060 --> 01:25:09.830
of these feedback loops.

01:25:09.830 --> 01:25:11.040
A couple more.

01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:13.070
Here's an amazing thing.

01:25:13.070 --> 01:25:15.860
You take somebody with
clinical depression,

01:25:15.860 --> 01:25:18.020
and you force
them, mechanically,

01:25:18.020 --> 01:25:22.220
to take a somatic state that
mediates different emotions

01:25:22.220 --> 01:25:23.620
and signifies other emotions.

01:25:23.620 --> 01:25:24.920
What am I talking about?

01:25:24.920 --> 01:25:26.580
You take the person
with depression,

01:25:26.580 --> 01:25:29.400
and you say, you are
going to mechanically go

01:25:29.400 --> 01:25:31.370
through the process,
with your facial muscles,

01:25:31.370 --> 01:25:33.960
of smiling-- again
and again and again.

01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:36.610
And you force somebody to do
that for a half hour or so,

01:25:36.610 --> 01:25:37.520
intermittently.

01:25:37.520 --> 01:25:39.810
And they feel better afterward.

01:25:39.810 --> 01:25:43.800
The world is just as depressing
as it was 30 minutes before,

01:25:43.800 --> 01:25:46.170
but there's something
going on here, saying,

01:25:46.170 --> 01:25:48.350
if I am getting
feedback saying I'm

01:25:48.350 --> 01:25:49.990
doing this thing with
my muscles, here,

01:25:49.990 --> 01:25:53.550
and I'm doing it a lot,
it must not be so bad.

01:25:53.550 --> 01:25:55.980
Other studies showing
you take somebody

01:25:55.980 --> 01:25:58.530
and either they are
slumped in a chair

01:25:58.530 --> 01:26:00.220
or you have them
sitting up erect,

01:26:00.220 --> 01:26:03.060
and you tell them the score
that they got on a test

01:26:03.060 --> 01:26:04.690
that you just gave
them before that,

01:26:04.690 --> 01:26:06.410
and it's a very good score.

01:26:06.410 --> 01:26:09.390
And what you see is, the more
straight upright the person is

01:26:09.390 --> 01:26:11.570
sitting, afterward,
the more they

01:26:11.570 --> 01:26:13.870
will assess themselves
as being made happy

01:26:13.870 --> 01:26:17.890
by the result they got, and
being made to feel proud.

01:26:17.890 --> 01:26:19.140
What's up with that?

01:26:19.140 --> 01:26:22.490
The posture of your spine
is doing something up here.

01:26:22.490 --> 01:26:26.230
What this shows us is, amid
this whole orientation--

01:26:26.230 --> 01:26:29.860
the brain controlling hormones,
the brain controlling spinal,

01:26:29.860 --> 01:26:32.130
autonomic stuff, the
limbic system telling--

01:26:32.130 --> 01:26:36.420
all of this outflow from there,
completing this big circle back

01:26:36.420 --> 01:26:38.320
to the very first class--

01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:41.890
That business of, think about
something really emotionally

01:26:41.890 --> 01:26:44.690
laden, and suddenly your
body works differently.

01:26:44.690 --> 01:26:47.200
Think about the people
who have committed murders

01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:51.340
in the context of a brain
tumor, a period, their hormone

01:26:51.340 --> 01:26:54.640
levels, their nutritional
history, here.

01:26:54.640 --> 01:26:57.990
Junk-food murders and all
of that-- Twinkie defenses.

01:26:57.990 --> 01:27:01.410
What that is, is the
other half of this loop.

01:27:01.410 --> 01:27:02.120
OK.

01:27:02.120 --> 01:27:06.280
So now you should sit straight
up and be proud of yourself,

01:27:06.280 --> 01:27:08.060
because you now have
all of the buckets

01:27:08.060 --> 01:27:10.010
necessary under
your belt. So that's

01:27:10.010 --> 01:27:11.400
the first piece of good news.

01:27:11.400 --> 01:27:14.090
And that now transitions
us to the latter half

01:27:14.090 --> 01:27:17.820
of the course, which will now be
to use all of these approaches

01:27:17.820 --> 01:27:20.000
in looking at
specific behaviors.

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:23.190
Here is a sexual
behavior, first off.

01:27:23.190 --> 01:27:25.320
As a good ethologist,
do we actually

01:27:25.320 --> 01:27:28.270
understand what we've just
observed for this species,

01:27:28.270 --> 01:27:29.790
this individual, et cetera?

01:27:29.790 --> 01:27:32.290
What went on in the
brain one second

01:27:32.290 --> 01:27:34.910
before that caused
that behavior to occur?

01:27:34.910 --> 01:27:36.980
What's up with the neurobiology?

01:27:36.980 --> 01:27:40.820
What sensory stimuli caused
those neurons to generate--

01:27:40.820 --> 01:27:43.980
The world of ethological
releasing stimuli.

01:27:43.980 --> 01:27:46.070
What hormones in
the bloodstream,

01:27:46.070 --> 01:27:48.530
in the last minute,
in the last hour,

01:27:48.530 --> 01:27:50.710
made the individual
more or less sensitive

01:27:50.710 --> 01:27:53.360
to that sensory information,
blah blah-- all the way

01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:56.570
back to understanding
the evolutionary legacy

01:27:56.570 --> 01:27:59.532
of the species of which
this individual is a member.

01:27:59.532 --> 01:28:01.740
That's going to be our
strategy in each one of these,

01:28:01.740 --> 01:28:03.950
now, working our
way back in time.

01:28:03.950 --> 01:28:07.430
So there's that great news that
you are in that position now

01:28:07.430 --> 01:28:08.180
to take it on.

01:28:08.180 --> 01:28:10.250
The other piece of
good news is, we're not

01:28:10.250 --> 01:28:11.300
going to do it on Monday.

01:28:11.300 --> 01:28:12.590
We won't have class on Monday.

01:28:12.590 --> 01:28:14.660
So you can all get
all James-Langey

01:28:14.660 --> 01:28:17.030
and freaked out for
the exam Monday night.

01:28:17.030 --> 01:28:18.955
But quick survey among the TAs.

01:28:18.955 --> 01:28:20.630
So, what do you guys think?

01:28:20.630 --> 01:28:23.150
Should we have a
review session then?

01:28:23.150 --> 01:28:25.622
Should we show a David
Attenborough movie?

01:28:25.622 --> 01:28:26.919
Show the Attenborough.

01:28:26.919 --> 01:28:27.460
Attenborough.

01:28:27.460 --> 01:28:28.800
OK, David Attenborough.

01:28:28.800 --> 01:28:30.950
So which one are you
going to bring in?

01:28:30.950 --> 01:28:33.330
We'll watch Life,
the BBC version,

01:28:33.330 --> 01:28:34.330
with David Attenborough.

01:28:34.330 --> 01:28:36.635
I don't think it's really
available in the US

01:28:36.635 --> 01:28:39.410
very much yet, so it's
kind of a cool oppor--

01:28:39.410 --> 01:28:42.660

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.465
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:08.230
Stanford University.

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:09.930
Is this on?

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.770
Yes.

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:14.350
Well, congratulations.

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.000
Everybody has survived
the midterm including

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.630
the TAs so far, who
recently have been let out

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.020
of their entombment
with thousands

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.600
of pages of exam pages.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:33.870
So those are rolling along,
and everybody is still awake

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:34.831
so that's good.

00:00:34.831 --> 00:00:35.330
OK.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.000
So we have now
officially entered

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.190
the second half of the course.

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.560
And organizational
things-- readings

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.341
will now be read hopefully.

00:00:46.341 --> 00:00:46.840
OK.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.850
So that's not useful.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:49.430
Books.

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.929
Books.

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:52.080
Now is a good time to
actually go and start

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.280
reading those books.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.150
And again, if you are not
up to all of both of them,

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.220
some recommend the
chapters have come along.

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:01.720
Pay attention to those.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.650
And again, a subset of you-- may
not know it yet, but about 25%

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.470
of you will have your life
transformed by that chaos book,

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.760
whereas 25% will resent
the purchase price

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.180
and my forcing you to do this.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.970
Also, another major,
major transition here,

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.100
which is, as far as I can
tell so far, I have run out

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.870
of steam turning
the extended notes

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.860
into actual expository
writing, so they're just

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.580
going to take the form of really
poorly organized outlines.

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:32.860
So that happens.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.270
OK.

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.860
What else?

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.990
What we now
transition to is going

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.790
to be our strategy for the
rest of our course, which

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.805
is to look at various subjects.

00:01:42.805 --> 00:01:46.460
And coming down the pike after
the lectures today and Friday

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.710
on sexual behavior will be
aggression, competition,

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.050
cooperation, empathy,
potentially language

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:56.794
use, schizophrenia.

00:01:56.794 --> 00:01:58.210
Somewhere in there,
there is going

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.120
to be a week or so
on that chaos stuff.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.270
But for all of
these subjects, we

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.580
are now going to follow
the general strategy.

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.259
We will start off looking
at what the behavior is.

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.100
And what we're going
to try to do there,

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.860
in addition to looking at in
lots of different species,

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.130
is to be as objective as
any good old ethologist

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.280
in considering the
fixed action patterns

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.520
of the particular behavior.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.320
That established, with the
promise that, in lots of cases,

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.340
what we think comprise
some of these behaviors

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:29.970
turn out not to be the case.

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.770
That established,
what we will start

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.910
is our inexorable march to
the left, the timeline that

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.780
constitutes everything
we learn now,

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.880
stepping back and saying, OK.

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.400
One millisecond before
that behavior occurred,

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.270
what was going on in the brain?

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:46.610
What parts of the brain?

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.380
What neurotransmitters?

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.730
All of that.

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.480
Stepping back before that, a
second before, a minute before,

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.390
whatever, what was
it in the environment

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.290
that triggered the brain
to produce that behavior?

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.960
What was the acute
releasing stimulus?

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:06.920
Stepping back, what do
hormone levels that hour,

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.770
that day, some such
time span of that,

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:14.400
what acute hormonal exposure
had to do with sensitizing you

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.920
to the environmental
stimulus which

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.970
released the nervous system
into generating the behavior.

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.850
Marching all the way back, throw
in culture some place or other.

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.320
Perinatal effects, early
developmental hormonal stuff,

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.290
eventually considering what do
the genetics of the individual,

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.150
of the population, of
the species-- evolution

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.050
kicking in there
some place or other--

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:40.460
what do all of these things
and something having to do

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:42.780
with ecology thrown in
there just for good measure.

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.600
Working our way back
in each of these cases,

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.450
understanding what was
the biology of one second

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.050
before, one minute, one hour,
one million years before that

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:54.240
gave rise to it.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.720
Back to our two major
themes from day one,

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.110
we are now about to be
unbound, unfettered,

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.190
by our buckets, our
categorical buckets,

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.020
and instead explore
their interactions.

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.740
The other being that notion
from the very first class, which

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:12.810
is that any given
point, if we're

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.350
talking about chronic
hormonal effects

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.709
on this behavior, what
we're talking about

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.709
is the way those hormone
patterns were shaped

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:23.880
during this period,
the way genes

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.860
contributed to the
enzymes that make

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.680
the hormones, the receptors.

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.130
The second you're talking
about genetics, all of this

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:32.400
is becoming apparent.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.430
At every one of these
points, whatever

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.670
point we are talking
about is going

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:39.890
to be the end product of
everything to the left

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:43.176
and just as temporary sort
of footing before going

00:04:43.176 --> 00:04:44.300
to the things on the right.

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.490
So this will be our
strategy forever after now.

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.720
So we start off doing
this with looking

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.994
at sexual behavior,
the neurobiology,

00:04:53.994 --> 00:04:56.285
the endocrinology, the early
experiences, et cetera, et

00:04:56.285 --> 00:04:57.120
cetera.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.740
So to inaugurate the second
half of the course and the fact

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.440
that it's starting off with
lectures on sexual behavior,

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.960
it has to start off with the
stupid obligatory sex joke.

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.170
OK.

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:11.450
So the Martians come to
Earth, and they turn out

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:13.440
to be great guys.

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:14.770
They are really terrific.

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.690
They get along wonderfully
with Earthlings.

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:18.490
All of them like
each other a lot.

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.140
They're all becoming
great friends.

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:23.980
They pass their hours learning
about each other's planets.

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:25.610
What's the weather like there?

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:27.440
What are sports like here?

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:28.445
What are recipes?

00:05:28.445 --> 00:05:30.070
Everybody's getting
along terrifically.

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:32.257
And eventually, the
Earthlings and the Martians

00:05:32.257 --> 00:05:34.340
are getting along well
enough that they get around

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:37.230
to asking the question that
everybody is really interested

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:41.620
in, which is, well, how do you
folks go about reproducing?

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:42.780
So the decision was made.

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.420
The Martians are
going to go first.

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:48.050
So they clear out a big space,
and a whole bunch of Martians

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:51.120
come in there and they stand
on top of each other heads,

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.500
and their noses flash
different colors,

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.402
and steam comes out
of various orifices,

00:05:56.402 --> 00:05:58.110
and there's clanking
noises and whatever.

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:00.560
And out pops a new
little Martian.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:04.190
And the Earthlings say,
wow, that was great.

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:05.310
Love the concept.

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:07.021
And I got great video of that.

00:06:07.021 --> 00:06:08.520
And that's terrific
and all of that.

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:09.019
OK

00:06:09.019 --> 00:06:09.990
So that's worked out.

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:11.760
And now it's the humans turn.

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:15.390
So a willing couple is found,
and some space is cleared out.

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:18.030
And the Martians sit down
there with their video cameras

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:18.800
as well.

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.470
And clicking away.

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:21.920
And this couple goes at it.

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:24.990
And they finish the whole thing
in a sweaty mess at the end.

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:26.960
And the Martian say,
that's wonderful.

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.200
That's so interesting.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.844
You Earthlings are just endless.

00:06:29.844 --> 00:06:31.260
And the fascinating
things you do,

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:35.000
but we have one question
though, which is,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.990
so where's the new human?

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:39.570
And they said, oh,
that takes nine months.

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:44.040
They say, well, why were they
in such a rush at the end?

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:47.870
So our first question
here is, why were they

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:49.480
in such a rush at the end?

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:49.980
OK.

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:51.290
Three possible answers.

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:53.660
Choice number
one-- vote for it--

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:55.630
why were they in such
a rush at the end?

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:58.410
Number one, because they
were acting with this fervent

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:02.110
desire to do something for
the good of the species.

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:03.920
Just seeing if any hands go up.

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:04.960
That's a good thing.

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:08.605
Option number two,
doing that because you

00:07:08.605 --> 00:07:10.730
want to maximize the number
of copies of your genes

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:12.460
passed on to the
next generation.

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:16.240
Option number three,
because it feels good.

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:16.740
OK.

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:17.890
One hand goes up.

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:20.130
And I'm not sure what that
indicates about everyone,

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:24.380
but I will remind you from
the survey in the first class

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:26.650
there that a far greater
percentage of you

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:29.220
want to learn about depression
than about sexual behavior.

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:32.131
So there you have it with
the Stanford experience.

00:07:32.131 --> 00:07:32.630
OK.

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:34.850
Because it feels good.

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:37.310
And what we deal with
here right off the start

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:42.460
is this important dichotomy
between proximal and distal

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:44.330
explanations for behavior.

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:46.780
Explanation, a
distal explanation,

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:48.930
for sexual behavior,
parentheses,

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:50.900
why were they in such
a rush at the end?

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:53.080
Passing on copies of
your genes, the effects

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.260
of hormones, and
certain reward pathways

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:56.490
in the brain, all of that.

00:07:56.490 --> 00:08:00.670
Proximal mechanism being
that it feels good.

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:02.840
And starting off right
off the bat the thing

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:04.860
to make sense of
with sexual behavior

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:08.930
is it is driven by this
amazing little loop here

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:12.290
of sensory stimuli,
and feedback,

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:16.680
and immediate sensations that
drive the behavior coming out.

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:20.440
And all this stuff down here
is for the doctoral thesis

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:21.870
somewhere down the line.

00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:24.010
That's not what
the motivation is.

00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:27.100
Probably more than any other of
the behaviors we will look at,

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:30.280
the driving forces are
very proximal ones.

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:33.730
Nobody sits there and figures
out how many copies of genes

00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:37.220
they are passing on and thus are
willing to speed up to produce

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:39.150
a new human nine months later.

00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:42.030
It is instead, in
species after species,

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:44.720
it is proximal
motivating mechanisms

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:46.800
for generating the behaviors.

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:47.460
OK.

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:49.740
So beginning to look at
the actual behaviors,

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:53.680
there is a funny duality to
making sense of sexual behavior

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:57.180
across different species,
a funny sort of contrast.

00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:02.280
The first one being that, well,
all species go about sex--

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:05.190
or all vertebrate
species go about sex

00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:07.570
in a roughly similar way.

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:10.590
Yet, you don't want to be
too similar to the species

00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:11.550
next door.

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:13.890
There's an interesting
sort of dichotomy there.

00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:17.570
All sorts of vertebrate
species are doing things

00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:21.520
with pelvic thrusting
and orgasms and-- hey,

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:24.630
stay tuned that's
coming-- and ejaculation,

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:27.220
and lordotic reflexes,
and things of that sort.

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:32.280
Highly conserved fixed action
patterns across lots and lots

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:33.500
of different species.

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:36.830
None the less, amid that,
you've got this other problem,

00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:40.440
which is you want to have these
fixed action patterns being

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:42.940
specific to your species.

00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:44.690
You do not want to mess up.

00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:46.800
So there is this
strange simultaneity

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:50.910
of very, very conserved
basic building

00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:53.980
blocks of the fixed action
patterns of sexual behavior.

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:58.880
But along with that, a lot of
selectivity within species.

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:01.300
Now how does that
selectivity begin to work?

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:04.870
What you get is this very
interesting interplay,

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:09.130
this intercalation, between the
releasing stimuli and the fixed

00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:10.230
action pattern.

00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:13.175
What you get is this
chaining of behavior.

00:10:13.175 --> 00:10:16.620
In other words, the fixed
action pattern of one

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:20.580
of the individuals constitutes
the releasing stimulus

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:23.840
for the other individual's
fixed action pattern, which

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:27.410
constitutes the releasing
stimulus for this individual's

00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:28.810
fixed action pattern.

00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:31.880
This chaining of
transitions there,

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:34.180
of interplay between
these two, which

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:37.560
is where you get the
species specificity from.

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:38.420
OK.

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:40.820
So in terms of making
sense of that, of course,

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:44.340
any of this in terms of looking
at the general features of how

00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:47.300
to think about sexual behavior
across species, of course, what

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:51.670
you have to have out the wazoo
is your basic ethology credo

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:53.910
of interviewing an animal
in its own language

00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:56.220
about its sexual
behavior, wonderfully

00:10:56.220 --> 00:11:00.000
summarized in this quote by
Martha McClintock, researcher.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.800
I think I've used
this quote already,

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:03.780
which is, in her
particular case,

00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:07.370
studying female rat sexual
behavior, which turns out

00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:09.550
to be this very ornate
process involving

00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:11.930
a lot of running around
on the part of the female.

00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:15.300
Studying female rat
sexual behavior in a cage

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:18.640
is like trying to study swimming
behavior of a dolphin in a bath

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:19.270
tub.

00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:21.670
You need to get it in
the natural setting,

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:24.430
or else you are going to
lose all sorts of insight.

00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:27.770
In the particular realm of
female rat sexual behavior,

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:30.500
the standard picture
for decades and decades,

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:33.420
the centuries where our
finest minds have looked

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:35.980
at rats having sex,
the standard dogma

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:40.550
has been that the female role
is a very passive receptive one.

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:42.572
And it turns out it's a
very passive receptive

00:11:42.572 --> 00:11:44.030
one if she doesn't
have enough room

00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:46.930
to run around and do all sorts
of courting stuff on her own,

00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:51.620
all sorts of proceptive sexual
behaviors, which she can't see,

00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:54.500
if you're studying an animal
in a setting where they can't

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:56.390
speak in their own language.

00:11:56.390 --> 00:12:00.180
So a big, big vote for
ethological logical principles

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:01.690
when it comes to this.

00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:02.340
All right.

00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:05.250
So just to get some jargon
under our belt right

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:08.020
from the start here, in terms
of how the professionals talk

00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:10.160
about sex when they're
talking about sex

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:11.920
and trying to sound
like professionals,

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:13.570
here are some of the terms.

00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:16.240
Old outdated term,
Freudian term,

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:20.220
that nonetheless has
entered the general world

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:25.110
of referring to sexual arousal
and motivation-- libido.

00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:28.790
Libido, as we will see that
commonplace everyday usage

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:33.040
term, is perhaps more
technically described

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:34.400
as horniness.

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:37.070
But it can also be
described as one term

00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:39.910
within a trio of the terms
that people in the business

00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:45.230
really use most frequently--
attractivity, proceptivity,

00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:46.870
and receptivity.

00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:50.120
Quick, get to work on poems
about those three terms.

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:52.970
But what you've got
here is attractivity,

00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:57.090
how attractive an individual
is to someone else.

00:12:57.090 --> 00:13:00.380
Receptivity, how
receptive that individual

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:03.550
is to the interest of
the other individual.

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:07.330
Proceptivity, the
active behaviors

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:11.140
that are carried out in
response to being attracted to.

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:13.780
And thus, you could say
because of the attractiveness

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:16.150
of this organism,
this other organism

00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:18.970
began proceptive behaviors
which did or did not

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:22.710
prove to meet with receptive
fixed action patterns

00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:23.800
and responses.

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:25.730
The very words any
of us would use

00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:27.590
to describe what
goes on at a party.

00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:28.090
OK.

00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:30.450
So we've got that triad
there, the terms that

00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:34.470
are much more in common than
terms like libido or arousal

00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:35.610
or motivation.

00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:37.270
These are the more common ones.

00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:40.400
What is another realm, in
terms that are much more used,

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:43.020
these are much
more zoology terms.

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:45.410
What's used far more
often in clinical medicine

00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:49.140
is a description, a
dichotomy, between motivation

00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:50.790
and performance.

00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:54.330
And that is never used more
frequently than in the realm

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:56.650
of making sense of
sexual motivation

00:13:56.650 --> 00:14:00.440
in men as dissociable
from erectile function

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:03.820
versus dysfunction,
motivation being very, very

00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:06.190
different from performance.

00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:08.760
So that's another
realm of distinctions.

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:12.770
Other realms as well--
desire, orgasms, arousal,

00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:14.480
all sorts of commonplace terms.

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:17.590
The performance versus
motivation dichotomy

00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:21.400
and the proceptivity,
receptivity, [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:24.050
are the major terms
that are used.

00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:26.220
Next issue, in terms
of getting to this,

00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:28.770
how do people find
out information

00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:30.360
about sexual behavior?

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:33.230
One option is to sit there
with night viewing goggles.

00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:35.460
And that's very useful
for nocturnal species.

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:38.470
But how do people find out
about human sexual behavior?

00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:40.590
All sorts of ways
over the years,

00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:42.580
starting with anonymous
questionnaires.

00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:47.370
But a really clever technique
was worked out in the 1980s.

00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:50.080
A biological mathematician
named Joel Cohen

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:52.830
getting at how to get
people to tell you

00:14:52.830 --> 00:14:56.350
about very embarrassing things
about their sexual lives.

00:14:56.350 --> 00:15:00.210
And this was prompted in the
80s when AIDS first swept in,

00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:04.560
and it was wildly,
wildly taboo at the time

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:06.920
in virtually every
corner of this country

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:10.350
to admit to having a less
than standard, white bread

00:15:10.350 --> 00:15:11.950
sexual orientation.

00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:15.220
Take a look at the extended
notes to see the trick

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:18.480
that Joel Cohen came up
with, a very clever device

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:21.250
in order to figure out
what percentage of people

00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:24.540
are doing what sexually
without asking anybody

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:27.030
to give an answer that
they would find, perhaps,

00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:31.650
to be embarrassing or grounds
for all sorts of persecution.

00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:32.660
OK.

00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:36.660
So beginning to look at
aspects of behavior and other

00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:40.060
features of the rightmost
end of all of this.

00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:43.360
We start off with the
most central puzzle

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:46.590
in making sense of any of
this stuff, which is, so

00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:49.640
what's up with female orgasms?

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:53.090
And we've got right off
the bat the simple problem

00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:56.930
of making sense of this
biological phenomenon and one

00:15:56.930 --> 00:15:59.950
where fertility is
not dependent on it.

00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:03.260
One does not need to have
orgasms to become pregnant,

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:06.400
to give birth, to pass
on copies of one's genes.

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:08.160
So what's the deal with orgasms?

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:10.380
First off, a question
we will wind up

00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:13.310
asking with a whole lot of the
behavior coming down the line

00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:16.050
is, are we the only species?

00:16:16.050 --> 00:16:18.320
And all sorts of
careful studies have

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:21.010
shown that we are
not the only species.

00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:24.310
Other apes, other
primate species, as well

00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:28.110
monkeys and apes, show
orgasm among the females.

00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:31.450
And that is detectable by
all sorts of physiology

00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:32.780
we'll hear about in a while.

00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:34.590
We are not the only species.

00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:37.480
One of the really
bizarre, pathetic things

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:39.650
about trying to do
research in this area

00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:43.060
was one of the first papers
that ever demonstrated something

00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:46.860
which physiologically was
identical to female orgasm

00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:49.680
in rhesus monkey
females, which wound up

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:51.800
being a paper in
this journal Science.

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:53.590
Down there in the
footnotes, the authors

00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:58.100
had to indicate this did not
make use of any federal grant

00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:00.420
money to carry out the study.

00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:03.430
Just to give you a sense of
where some of the stuff sits.

00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:03.930
OK.

00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:06.339
So what's up with female orgasm?

00:17:06.339 --> 00:17:09.609
It is not necessary
for conception.

00:17:09.609 --> 00:17:12.140
It is not necessary to
increase the number of copies

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:14.099
of your genes in
future generations.

00:17:14.099 --> 00:17:16.690
Despite that, there
is some evidence

00:17:16.690 --> 00:17:20.119
that it facilitates
fertilization.

00:17:20.119 --> 00:17:22.930
And the technical term that's
always been given for that

00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:26.319
is, bizarrely
enough, facilitation.

00:17:26.319 --> 00:17:30.120
The notion is something about
the vaginal fluid, something

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:34.780
about the biochemistry of,
increases sperm motility.

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:39.590
Sperm swim faster and harder
and jump upstream back to spawn

00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:41.540
or whatever it is
the sperm are doing

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:45.330
with more avidity, with
more energetic displays,

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:49.220
in an environment of
more vaginal secretion.

00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:52.210
And orgasm greatly
increases that.

00:17:52.210 --> 00:17:54.980
So the argument there
being that orgasm

00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:58.970
facilitates fertilization
through the sperm facilitation

00:17:58.970 --> 00:17:59.980
process.

00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:02.650
Evidence for that has always
been a little bit indirect.

00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:05.810
It is not airtight
that that happens.

00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:09.490
Another argument for why
this increases fertility.

00:18:09.490 --> 00:18:13.770
And this is sort of
an interesting one.

00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:16.760
And the notion here is that
what an orgasm does is,

00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:19.360
among other things,
exhausts you enormously,

00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:21.380
causing you to be
far more likely to be

00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:24.610
horizontal than vertical
shortly thereafter, and thus,

00:18:24.610 --> 00:18:27.190
facilitating fertilization
because the sperm don't

00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:30.580
have to swim straight
up against gravity.

00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:31.540
I kid you not.

00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:33.920
This is one of the
leading models out there.

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:37.200
Then there's the orgasm
facilitates female conception

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:40.050
out of reinforcement
theory, which is back

00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:43.237
to the it feels good and thus
you are more likely to do it

00:18:43.237 --> 00:18:45.570
again and increasing the
likelihood of passing on copies

00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:46.290
of your genes.

00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:47.580
All of this is wonderful.

00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:49.960
All of these possible
mechanisms where,

00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:54.070
even though female orgasm is
not necessary for conception,

00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:57.160
it nonetheless increases
the likelihood of.

00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:58.510
That's great.

00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:01.010
However, what most of
the studies have shown,

00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:03.250
though, is there
is no relationship

00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:06.400
between the fertility of
a woman and her propensity

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:07.680
towards orgasm.

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:11.010
It does not seem to play
out in so far as any

00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:13.690
of this facilitation
or horizontal

00:19:13.690 --> 00:19:17.630
swim enhancement techniques
or whatever actually occurs--

00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:20.370
these are not big enough
of effects to actually make

00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:23.580
a difference in terms
of reproductive success.

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:24.370
So what else?

00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:25.570
What else is known about it?

00:19:25.570 --> 00:19:28.020
There is a certain
degree of heritability,

00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:31.420
of propensity towards
orgasm in females.

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:34.050
And this is shown with
all our standard behavior

00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:37.340
genetics techniques in
terms of comparing dizygotic

00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:39.280
versus monozygotic twins.

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:43.170
We know what to do in terms
of not overvaluing findings

00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:43.980
like those.

00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:46.140
Nonetheless, they are there.

00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:50.510
So if a basic puzzle is,
why do females have orgasms

00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:53.210
if it's not necessary for
conception and, in fact,

00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:56.180
the evidence is not great
that it even facilitates it,

00:19:56.180 --> 00:19:58.410
why on top of all of
that, why such things

00:19:58.410 --> 00:20:01.930
as clitoral orgasms, which
the studies generally show

00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:03.690
are more easily
brought about than

00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:06.360
are vaginal ones,
what's up with that?

00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:07.890
Even more the same question.

00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:10.000
Now somewhere in
there is a lurking

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.550
the heart breaking
possibility in making

00:20:12.550 --> 00:20:16.790
sense of why female orgasm
exists the dreadful possibility

00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:20.150
that what we're dealing
with here is a spandrel.

00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:22.030
And that it is a spandrel.

00:20:22.030 --> 00:20:24.440
It is simply baggage
brought along

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:28.940
that those guys have to go
through this orgasm physiology

00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:32.390
to do any stuff with sperm
and pass on copies of genes

00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:33.380
and all of that.

00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:36.900
And it's simply baggage
that the same physiology

00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:38.240
occurs in females.

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:42.860
That orgasm is simply
a spandrel in women.

00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:46.100
And the counter scenario
that's always given

00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:48.960
is, this is exactly
equivalent to the notion

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:51.730
that nipples are
spandrels in men,

00:20:51.730 --> 00:20:54.960
in that women, female
mammals, need to go about all

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:56.380
this lactation business.

00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:58.740
And that's part of the
whole package deal.

00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:03.470
And just as it would be way
too much work to evolve females

00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:05.410
without orgasms,
it would be way too

00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:07.770
much to get rid of those
useless nipples on men.

00:21:07.770 --> 00:21:08.270
OK.

00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:09.660
Let's have a quick survey.

00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:11.360
Yes?

00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:12.842
So could a lot of
those questions

00:21:12.842 --> 00:21:15.686
also be applied to why
do male have orgasms?

00:21:15.686 --> 00:21:18.060
Because ejaculation can
occur without orgasm.

00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:18.650
OK.

00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:21.020
So why do males have orgasms?

00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:25.590
Ejaculation can occur--
it is far more voluminous

00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:27.320
in the face of an orgasm.

00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:31.810
So that's easily framed in
terms of an adaptive mechanism.

00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:32.350
OK.

00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:33.890
Quick survey here.

00:21:33.890 --> 00:21:37.370
How many people--
OK, how many guys

00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:39.490
who have those useless
nipples, how many of you

00:21:39.490 --> 00:21:42.496
go for the nipple as
spandrel in guys theory?

00:21:46.001 --> 00:21:46.500
Whoa.

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:48.370
Is that slow in the hands?

00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:48.920
OK.

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:50.325
Should I raise my hand?

00:21:50.325 --> 00:21:51.450
Should I not raise my hand?

00:21:51.450 --> 00:21:53.440
OK.

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:56.300
Women in the room, how many
go for the female orgasm

00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:58.700
is merely spandrel theory?

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:05.640
If I recall, there was one other
question somewhere a few weeks

00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:07.840
back that only got one
person fessing up to it,

00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:10.110
and it came somewhere
around there also.

00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:12.615
So I don't know if
that's the lighting

00:22:12.615 --> 00:22:15.270
or if people tend to
sit in the same places.

00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:15.770
OK.

00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:19.690
So not a whole lot of enthusiasm
for the spandrel concepts here.

00:22:19.690 --> 00:22:23.510
Nonetheless, that needs to
be seriously entertained.

00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:24.190
OK.

00:22:24.190 --> 00:22:28.410
So now looking at other features
of the fixed action patterns,

00:22:28.410 --> 00:22:30.840
and amid all these
different species

00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:35.460
doing lordotic stuff and
orgasms and ejaculation and all

00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:38.730
of that, what are some of
the realms of sexual behavior

00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:41.460
that are relatively
unique to humans?

00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:44.800
First off, one that used to be
thought to be absolutely unique

00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:47.460
was non-reproductive sex.

00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:50.550
This is a world of difference
than those species where

00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:53.910
the female ovulates for like
2 and 1/2 hours every year,

00:22:53.910 --> 00:22:55.560
and everybody mates
at that point.

00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:58.600
Or species where
somebody comes into heat,

00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:00.210
a female is in estrus.

00:23:00.210 --> 00:23:03.100
Humans have
non-reproductive sex.

00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:05.550
And that was viewed
as absolutely unique.

00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:08.570
What it is now clear is it
is not completely unique.

00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:10.810
There are lots of
other species that do,

00:23:10.810 --> 00:23:14.910
probably most famously bonobo
chimps and various cetaceans

00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:15.610
like dolphins.

00:23:15.610 --> 00:23:19.490
Nonetheless, it is certainly
a specialty among humans.

00:23:19.490 --> 00:23:20.490
What else?

00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:24.750
Foreplay, that used to be in the
category of human specialties.

00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:28.140
And it is clear by now that
bonobo chimps, for example,

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:30.960
have vastly more
patience with foreplay

00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:32.210
than average humans do.

00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:34.960
We are not the only
species with that either.

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:37.430
Huge, huge controversy.

00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:42.070
How unique is homosexuality
to human behavior?

00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:43.520
Human sexual behavior?

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:47.170
And what's clear increasingly
is we're not the only species

00:23:47.170 --> 00:23:48.260
with that either.

00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:52.250
The original view, when people
would view homosexual behavior,

00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:55.040
male-male, female-female,
in other species,

00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:57.010
it would be animals
in captivity.

00:23:57.010 --> 00:23:58.800
And it would be
the, why is there

00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:01.610
so much homosexuality
in prisons argument--

00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:02.980
lack of alternatives.

00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:06.030
This was not normal,
natural behavior.

00:24:06.030 --> 00:24:08.660
What is clear from
ethological field studies

00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:11.060
is we are by no means
the only species

00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:12.960
to have homosexual behavior.

00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:14.140
What else?

00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:17.560
One of the things that we do
seem to be fairly unique about

00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:21.450
is having egalitarian
sex, which is

00:24:21.450 --> 00:24:24.770
to say that there are
no human cultures where

00:24:24.770 --> 00:24:28.820
as part of the central
tenets of that culture people

00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:31.860
are restricted, only a
subset of individuals

00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:33.490
are allowed to reproduce.

00:24:33.490 --> 00:24:35.280
And this is a
world of difference

00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:36.500
from various species.

00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:39.280
For example, New World
monkeys, marmosets,

00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:42.280
where it is only one
male and one female

00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:44.400
in a group that does
the reproducing.

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:49.780
Instead, humans in every culture
ever seen have egalitarian sex.

00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:50.580
What else?

00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:52.340
What else is highly human?

00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:54.560
People used to
think exclusively so

00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:56.950
this endless quest for variety.

00:24:56.950 --> 00:24:59.560
And again, just take a look
at these bonobo chimps,

00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:02.510
and you'll see how small minded
we are when it comes to this.

00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:04.160
But something else
that is indeed

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:06.960
unique to human sexual
behavior is the notion

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:09.550
that this is something
you do in private.

00:25:09.550 --> 00:25:14.440
There is no other species where
the majority of sexual behavior

00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:17.820
is conducted intentionally
outside the sight of everybody

00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:18.380
else.

00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:21.050
That is rather unique to humans.

00:25:21.050 --> 00:25:23.380
What else about
human sexual behavior

00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:25.605
seems to be specializations?

00:25:25.605 --> 00:25:29.120
One that is fairly unique,
if not entirely so,

00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:33.120
is the subset of humans who
psychopathological confuse

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:34.970
sexual behavior with violence.

00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:37.890
And that seems not to have
a whole lot of precedence.

00:25:37.890 --> 00:25:40.930
So immediately one
asks other domains.

00:25:40.930 --> 00:25:45.060
Masturbation, that is not
remotely a human specialty.

00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:47.330
That has all sorts of
other species as well.

00:25:47.330 --> 00:25:49.910
And that used to get the,
well, what else is there

00:25:49.910 --> 00:25:53.460
to do when you're sitting in
the zoo-- for the animals-- what

00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:54.640
else is there to do?

00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:56.060
It is not natural.

00:25:56.060 --> 00:25:57.720
It is a default whatever.

00:25:57.720 --> 00:25:59.420
But looking out
in the real world,

00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:01.350
and there is plenty of that.

00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:04.410
And one of the most like
implausible suggestions

00:26:04.410 --> 00:26:07.130
for an adaptive
just so story thing

00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:09.640
is, why do male
primates masturbate

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:11.280
to the point of ejaculation?

00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:13.470
They tend to eat
the semen afterward.

00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:14.310
Whoa!

00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:18.070
Great source of protein,
go the adaptationists.

00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:20.880
Everything has an
adaptive basis.

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:24.040
This one does not ring
terribly true to me.

00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:25.380
What else?

00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:25.940
Fantasy.

00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:28.420
Fantasy in humans, is
that unique to humans?

00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:30.710
Obviously, we haven't a clue.

00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:33.380
But here's one suggestion to
me that this is not actually

00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:33.900
the case.

00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:37.290
And this was years ago where
I was watching my baboons,

00:26:37.290 --> 00:26:40.020
and there was this
one low ranking kid,

00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:43.240
this snivelly adolescent kid,
where the nearest thing he has

00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:45.080
ever gotten to a
female in his life

00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:48.460
with some high ranking female
in a bad mood beating on him.

00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:50.600
And he's sitting there
minding his own business.

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:54.020
And along comes, I think by
any baboon male standards,

00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:58.480
the hottest female in the troop,
who has a peek estrus swelling,

00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:00.450
is no doubt ovulating that day.

00:27:00.450 --> 00:27:02.630
Comes walking along,
followed two feet

00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:04.720
behind by the huge
menacing male,

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:06.420
who was in the
consortship with her.

00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:09.779
And our guy just sits there
and doesn't even quite

00:27:09.779 --> 00:27:10.820
look at what's happening.

00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:13.430
Every now and then, his eyes
go up, watching them go past.

00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:16.190
And as she walks past,
he gets an erection

00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:19.540
and then goes off
and masturbates.

00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:20.440
OK.

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:22.370
The charming-- I don't
know if this is even

00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:24.100
the word you can use
in this setting--

00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:27.400
but the charming notion is
that we've just seen evidence

00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:31.390
for some sort of internal
fantasy life going on this guy.

00:27:31.390 --> 00:27:31.990
OK.

00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:34.420
You could be a killjoy
instead and say, no, no.

00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:36.860
She was giving off
wafts of pheromones,

00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:38.930
and that was what was
responsible for it.

00:27:38.930 --> 00:27:40.710
Nonetheless this is
about as far as we

00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:42.650
can get at asking this
critical question,

00:27:42.650 --> 00:27:46.870
are we the only species that
does this fantasizing stuff?

00:27:46.870 --> 00:27:48.250
Marriage.

00:27:48.250 --> 00:27:50.780
Clearly, we've heard about
monogamous pair bonding

00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:51.540
species.

00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:55.230
In terms of the formal structure
of marriage, it is universal.

00:27:55.230 --> 00:27:57.960
All human cultures have
some version of it.

00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:01.070
Across all human cultures,
more than 90% of people

00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:03.290
wind up in that
culture's equivalent

00:28:03.290 --> 00:28:06.250
of a permanent,
stable relationship.

00:28:06.250 --> 00:28:08.380
And this is the case
in polygamous cultures.

00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:10.030
We've already heard
that business.

00:28:10.030 --> 00:28:13.620
Even though historically, the
majority of human cultures

00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:16.470
have been polygamous,
nonetheless, amid them,

00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:19.140
the vast majority of
individuals have been

00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:21.370
in monogamous relationships.

00:28:21.370 --> 00:28:24.040
Amid that, nonetheless,
what is also

00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:27.570
clear is amid that highly,
highly prevalent pattern

00:28:27.570 --> 00:28:30.850
of monogamous relationships,
there's a lot less monogamy

00:28:30.850 --> 00:28:32.650
going around than
you would think.

00:28:32.650 --> 00:28:35.960
And this was first sorted
out-- people like Alfred Kinsey

00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:38.420
when first working out
that questionnaire approach

00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:41.010
to people's sexual
behavior, what became clear

00:28:41.010 --> 00:28:45.930
was there is a lot less
faith within pair bonding,

00:28:45.930 --> 00:28:48.690
within humans in this
country and has since

00:28:48.690 --> 00:28:50.870
shown in all sorts
of other societies

00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:52.810
than one would
originally assume.

00:28:52.810 --> 00:28:57.070
There is social monogamy but
not necessarily anywhere near

00:28:57.070 --> 00:29:00.270
as high of rates
of sexual monogamy.

00:29:00.270 --> 00:29:02.440
And what the paternity
studies have shown

00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:05.390
is in most Western
European countries,

00:29:05.390 --> 00:29:07.800
the rate at which children
have been fathered

00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:11.850
by an individual other
than the person claiming

00:29:11.850 --> 00:29:16.720
marriageable credit for doing
so ranges between 10% and 40%

00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:17.940
of children.

00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:20.350
How's that for a number?

00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:21.070
OK.

00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:22.000
What else?

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.900
What else tends to be a feature
of human sexual behavior?

00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:29.875
What you have is, of course,
not only intrinsic in the fact

00:29:29.875 --> 00:29:32.000
that there's a difference
between social and sexual

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:32.800
monogamy.

00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:34.280
You have cheating.

00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:36.840
That is a human specialty
in every culture.

00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:39.850
What else is absolutely
wildly human?

00:29:39.850 --> 00:29:41.730
This notion of romance.

00:29:41.730 --> 00:29:44.610
And romance is,
by most estimates,

00:29:44.610 --> 00:29:48.080
a relatively new invention
in most cultures,

00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:49.910
maybe a couple of centuries old.

00:29:49.910 --> 00:29:52.370
And what is an even
newer invention

00:29:52.370 --> 00:29:55.290
is the notion that romance,
passion, et cetera,

00:29:55.290 --> 00:29:58.910
should persist, should last
throughout the entire duration

00:29:58.910 --> 00:30:00.530
of the lifetime's marriage.

00:30:00.530 --> 00:30:03.020
That is an utterly
novel concept.

00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:05.820
That is perhaps 30,
40, 50 years old

00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:07.740
in most Westernized countries.

00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:09.670
That's a new one as well.

00:30:09.670 --> 00:30:11.410
What that, of
course, ushers in is

00:30:11.410 --> 00:30:12.900
looking at issues of divorce.

00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:16.370
Across all cultures, the
average duration of marriages

00:30:16.370 --> 00:30:18.590
are two to four years.

00:30:18.590 --> 00:30:20.280
And people have
made the argument

00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:24.030
that that is the typical
duration of children being

00:30:24.030 --> 00:30:26.960
dependent on a high
degree of parenting,

00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:28.490
of both parents being around.

00:30:28.490 --> 00:30:32.360
That is the average interbirth
interval, two to four years,

00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:34.430
in most traditional
human cultures.

00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:36.770
What's the term
being described then

00:30:36.770 --> 00:30:39.960
if that is the "natural"
point at which most

00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:43.600
marriages dissolve and turn into
other monogamous relationships?

00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:46.660
The term that is
given is that humans

00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:51.180
tend toward being serial
monogamists, moving from one

00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:55.180
monogamous relationship to
another with, on the average,

00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:59.140
a lag time roughly corresponding
to the interbirth interval.

00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:00.290
So that's charming.

00:31:00.290 --> 00:31:01.510
What else?

00:31:01.510 --> 00:31:02.930
What else do you have?

00:31:02.930 --> 00:31:06.660
All sorts of other aspects
of human sexual variety,

00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:09.430
but ultimately, when you
look at human sexual behavior

00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:13.190
versus other species,
we are so boring.

00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:16.880
We are so limited when you look
at the range of unlikely things

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:18.200
going on out there.

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:22.570
Species that are
regularly hermaphroditic--

00:31:22.570 --> 00:31:24.510
and people, in fact,
have done studies

00:31:24.510 --> 00:31:27.510
on how is it that a
hermaphroditic animal does not

00:31:27.510 --> 00:31:29.020
try to have sex with itself?

00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:31.170
And these are usually
worm type things.

00:31:31.170 --> 00:31:33.520
And that's some version
of an incest avoidance.

00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:36.720
At the same time, there are
other species where individuals

00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:39.030
change sex opportunistically.

00:31:39.030 --> 00:31:41.480
All sorts of fish species
where that happens.

00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:43.980
Lots of species that
are parthenogenetic,

00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:47.970
where an individual reproduces
without the benefit of anybody

00:31:47.970 --> 00:31:49.580
else's genetic input.

00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:53.040
Even stranger, there's a bunch
of snake species that are

00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:56.740
parthenogenic, but the
females cannot reproduce

00:31:56.740 --> 00:32:00.280
parthenogenically unless
they mate with males.

00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:03.050
They do not actually get
any sperm from the males,

00:32:03.050 --> 00:32:05.050
and they get no
genetic contribution,

00:32:05.050 --> 00:32:07.140
but something about
that is necessary

00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:10.780
for the parthenogenetic
event to occur.

00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:11.280
OK.

00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:15.000
So all sorts of bizarrities that
make our fixed action patterns

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.840
look really pretty dull.

00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:19.900
But nonetheless, these are the
backbones of the human fixed

00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:21.970
action patterns,
and some of them

00:32:21.970 --> 00:32:24.160
wildly unique, some
of them far less

00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:26.090
than people used to
think, some of them

00:32:26.090 --> 00:32:28.000
very, very unprecedented.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:28.500
OK.

00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:32.040
So what this allows us to do
now is make our first big step.

00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:33.810
What's going on in the brain?

00:32:33.810 --> 00:32:36.750
What is the neurobiology
of sexual behavior

00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:39.700
producing those fixed
action patterns?

00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:42.730
And what you better bet
right off the bat is we

00:32:42.730 --> 00:32:44.920
are talking about
the limbic system.

00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:46.850
This is all limbic
system until we

00:32:46.850 --> 00:32:49.560
see ways in which it's not
just all the limbic system.

00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:51.810
But it is heavily
centered-- no surprise--

00:32:51.810 --> 00:32:53.000
in the limbic system.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:56.710
And this was being noted
first around the 1930s, 1940s

00:32:56.710 --> 00:33:00.610
with the first experiments where
there were lesion studies done

00:33:00.610 --> 00:33:03.550
damaging different parts of
the limbic system in animals.

00:33:03.550 --> 00:33:06.600
And what would be noted
was animal sexual behavior

00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:07.830
would change.

00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:10.880
And this was eventually
termed a profile,

00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:13.930
termed after the two scientists
who pioneered this stuff called

00:33:13.930 --> 00:33:18.230
the Kluvre-Bucy Syndrome,
which is when you damage some

00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:22.980
of these strange mysterious
rhinencephalonic structures

00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:25.880
in there, you change
the sexual behavior.

00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:28.540
You change, for
example, in monkeys,

00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:32.300
whether they are attempting
to mate with another monkey as

00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:34.080
opposed to an inanimate object.

00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:37.100
They change aspects of
the fixed action patterns

00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:38.430
of the behavior and such.

00:33:38.430 --> 00:33:40.820
And out of it, this was
one of the main driving

00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:44.240
forces on people saying,
nose-brain, well, that's great.

00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:45.850
But actually, what
we're looking at

00:33:45.850 --> 00:33:49.210
is a part of the brain that
has lots to do with emotion

00:33:49.210 --> 00:33:51.320
and emotionally
related behaviors.

00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:53.070
That was one of
the driving forces

00:33:53.070 --> 00:33:56.851
on the limbic system being
pulled together as a concept.

00:33:56.851 --> 00:33:57.350
OK.

00:33:57.350 --> 00:34:00.480
So what areas within the
limbic system are relevant?

00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:03.410
First pass, there are
different hot spots

00:34:03.410 --> 00:34:06.340
in there depending on gender.

00:34:06.340 --> 00:34:09.350
Among females, probably
the most important area

00:34:09.350 --> 00:34:11.820
is a subsection of the
hypothalamus called

00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:14.469
the ventral medial
hypothalamus involved

00:34:14.469 --> 00:34:16.360
in female sexual behavior.

00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:17.960
What's the evidence for that?

00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:20.870
Just go back to last
Friday's lecture--

00:34:20.870 --> 00:34:25.040
lesion studies, stimulation
studies, recording studies.

00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:28.610
Destroy the VMH, you do not
get sexual behavior anymore

00:34:28.610 --> 00:34:29.659
from a female.

00:34:29.659 --> 00:34:32.320
Stimulate it, and you will
get the same behaviors

00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:34.650
that you would normally
only see in an ovulating

00:34:34.650 --> 00:34:36.630
female rat for example.

00:34:36.630 --> 00:34:39.360
All the sorts of
tools we heard about.

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:41.679
Reinforcing this
even more is this

00:34:41.679 --> 00:34:44.730
is the hot spot in the
hypothalamus for receptors

00:34:44.730 --> 00:34:48.179
for estrogen and progesterone.

00:34:48.179 --> 00:34:50.730
So that makes lots of sense.

00:34:50.730 --> 00:34:54.300
Meanwhile, another region of
the brain that is typically

00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:56.469
involved in sexual
behavior in females,

00:34:56.469 --> 00:34:58.150
a region in the midbrain.

00:34:58.150 --> 00:35:01.460
The midbrain, which seems to
have something to do with some

00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:05.250
of the hormonal aspects
of sexual behavior

00:35:05.250 --> 00:35:07.050
that are specific to females.

00:35:07.050 --> 00:35:10.590
Finally, back to
that lordosis reflex,

00:35:10.590 --> 00:35:13.110
you got to have a
spinal cord to pull off

00:35:13.110 --> 00:35:15.870
the full array of typical
mammalian female sexual

00:35:15.870 --> 00:35:16.700
behavior.

00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:19.500
So spinal pathways,
which do not exist

00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:23.560
in males, lordotic reflexes,
the back arching reflex,

00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:26.930
is exclusively a female one.

00:35:26.930 --> 00:35:29.340
Meanwhile, over on the
other side of things,

00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:31.460
there are regions
in the brain that

00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:34.880
tend to be more specialized
for sexual behavior in males

00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:38.370
than in females-- a different
part of the hypothalamus

00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:41.270
called the medial preoptic area.

00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:43.740
And the exact same
sort of evidence

00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:45.510
is for the ventral
medial hypothalamus

00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:49.320
in females-- lesion studies,
stimulation, recording studies,

00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:51.330
all that sort of
thing, and-- you

00:35:51.330 --> 00:35:53.320
guessed it-- whopping
great amounts

00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:56.970
of testosterone receptors,
androgen receptors,

00:35:56.970 --> 00:36:00.020
within the medial preoptic area.

00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:04.140
Very interestingly, something we
will hear more about next week

00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:06.780
or so, is another
region of the brain

00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:09.420
is involved in male
sexual behavior, which

00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:11.770
is the amygdala.

00:36:11.770 --> 00:36:12.560
Mhm.

00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:13.890
That's kind of interesting.

00:36:13.890 --> 00:36:14.620
The amygdala.

00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:17.295
We've already heard about
amygdala fear, anxiety,

00:36:17.295 --> 00:36:18.440
and all of that.

00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:23.430
But the amygdala also plays a
very major role in aggression.

00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:26.390
And there's a little
bit, a small domain,

00:36:26.390 --> 00:36:28.570
of amygdaloid function
in males that's

00:36:28.570 --> 00:36:33.560
involved in sexual behavior,
involved in sexual motivation.

00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:37.640
Medial preoptic area is much
more about sexual performance

00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:38.680
in males.

00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:42.350
Amygdala is much more
about sexual motivation.

00:36:42.350 --> 00:36:45.500
And all sorts of people have
speculated fairly reasonably,

00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:47.390
I think, that this
may have something

00:36:47.390 --> 00:36:50.340
to do with the fact explaining
why, among humans, it

00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:53.250
is far more likely to
be males than females

00:36:53.250 --> 00:36:56.690
who go about confusing
sexuality with aggression.

00:36:56.690 --> 00:36:59.470
That it's got something
to do with this weird role

00:36:59.470 --> 00:37:02.140
of the amygdala in
male sexual motivation,

00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:04.220
male sexual arousal.

00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:05.600
What else?

00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:06.410
OK.

00:37:06.410 --> 00:37:08.810
Males have penises, thus
they're the only ones

00:37:08.810 --> 00:37:11.420
who can have penile
erections, and to do

00:37:11.420 --> 00:37:14.020
that, autonomic nervous system.

00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:16.120
And what we will hear
about, what you already

00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:18.480
heard about in the introduction
to the autonomic nervous

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:21.010
system, but also in
the zebra's book is

00:37:21.010 --> 00:37:24.510
that whole business in order to
manage that, to pull that off

00:37:24.510 --> 00:37:27.400
initially, it is
parasympathetic nervous system

00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:29.180
that establishes the erection.

00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:32.930
The process of arousal involves
the transition to sympathetic.

00:37:32.930 --> 00:37:34.960
Full blast sympathetic
nervous system

00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:38.300
needed for ejaculation, that's
what all of that is about.

00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:40.340
Exclusive to males.

00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:43.370
But then it turns out it's
not exclusive to males

00:37:43.370 --> 00:37:46.960
because it's virtually the
exact same physiology underlying

00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:50.970
clitoral erections in females,
the same exact sort of thing,

00:37:50.970 --> 00:37:53.600
which, of course, brings up
the dangerous possibility

00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:56.240
of another spandrel in
our laps here in terms

00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:57.470
of making sense of that.

00:37:57.470 --> 00:37:58.640
I didn't say that just now.

00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:01.230
Did I say spandrels in your lap?

00:38:01.230 --> 00:38:02.370
OK.

00:38:02.370 --> 00:38:04.900
Bringing up that
possibility that is not

00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:07.650
specific to male physiology.

00:38:07.650 --> 00:38:10.240
What is specific,
of course, is stuff

00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:13.020
that's going on with penises
in terms of blood flow.

00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:16.310
There's generally a
dichotomy between species,

00:38:16.310 --> 00:38:19.910
between whether or not
males get vascular erections

00:38:19.910 --> 00:38:22.070
or muscular erections.

00:38:22.070 --> 00:38:25.880
Vascular erections, you increase
blood flow into the penis,

00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:28.190
and you stop it from
going out the other end.

00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:31.060
And thus, you get a
vascular-driven engorgement

00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:33.830
as DH Lawrence would no
doubt have described it.

00:38:33.830 --> 00:38:35.750
Alternatively, in
lots of species

00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:37.810
there are muscular erections.

00:38:37.810 --> 00:38:41.350
There is a muscle, for example,
found in rodent penises called

00:38:41.350 --> 00:38:44.549
the erector [? levae ?]
muscle-- well,

00:38:44.549 --> 00:38:46.590
that's not too surprising
that it's called that--

00:38:46.590 --> 00:38:50.030
and a whole bunch of
cell bodied neurons

00:38:50.030 --> 00:38:54.590
in the spinal cord responsible
for pulling up the sail

00:38:54.590 --> 00:38:56.270
or whatever it is you do there.

00:38:56.270 --> 00:38:59.290
And what you get are
differences in general.

00:38:59.290 --> 00:39:02.820
The muscular-driven
erections occur a lot faster.

00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:05.150
The vascular ones,
the hemodynamic ones,

00:39:05.150 --> 00:39:07.110
last a lot longer.

00:39:07.110 --> 00:39:09.160
Take your pick, but
it's essentially

00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:13.370
the exact same autonomic
physiology in both cases.

00:39:13.370 --> 00:39:16.170
Finally, one other
thing, a factoid,

00:39:16.170 --> 00:39:19.190
a useful one we heard last
week, which is insofar

00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:22.120
as there is very
similar physiology

00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:25.890
to orgasms in both sexes,
there is that difference

00:39:25.890 --> 00:39:28.810
in recovery time,
how long it takes

00:39:28.810 --> 00:39:30.800
for the sympathetic
nervous system

00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:33.500
to go back to
baseline post orgasm.

00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:36.000
And on the average,
a substantial sex

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:36.980
difference in that.

00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:39.810
Yes, everybody managed
to guess it last week,

00:39:39.810 --> 00:39:41.220
which direction it went.

00:39:41.220 --> 00:39:46.460
A far slower recovery time
in females than in males.

00:39:46.460 --> 00:39:48.580
In terms of underlying
neurobiology,

00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:51.850
something that was a
major finding in the field

00:39:51.850 --> 00:39:55.640
were brain regions that
differed in size depending

00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:58.710
on your gender,
including in humans.

00:39:58.710 --> 00:40:03.020
And this ushered in a whole
world of sexual dimorphism

00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:04.110
in the brain.

00:40:04.110 --> 00:40:07.420
And there have now been shown
to be all sorts of brain regions

00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:10.250
where, on the average,
you get differences

00:40:10.250 --> 00:40:12.350
in the size of nuclei.

00:40:12.350 --> 00:40:14.070
You get differences
in the number

00:40:14.070 --> 00:40:17.980
of axons going through a
bundle of fiber, all of that.

00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:20.509
And we will hear about some
more of those down the line.

00:40:20.509 --> 00:40:22.800
But the one that has gotten
the most attention in terms

00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:27.800
of sexual behavior is a
cluster of tiny nuclei

00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:31.564
in the hypothalamus
called the INAH cluster,

00:40:31.564 --> 00:40:36.810
the Interstitial Nucleus of
the Anterior Hypothalamus.

00:40:36.810 --> 00:40:38.690
Do not write down
what that stands for.

00:40:38.690 --> 00:40:40.950
But it's a little
nucleus in there

00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:44.260
there, a little subset
of neuronal cell bodies,

00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:47.460
where you get a very
substantial sex difference

00:40:47.460 --> 00:40:50.710
in the size of this area,
where on the average,

00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:54.780
it is about twice the
size in men as in women.

00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:57.690
And back to the
other week's rant

00:40:57.690 --> 00:41:00.620
about statistical
significance versus magnitude,

00:41:00.620 --> 00:41:02.110
this is a big effect.

00:41:02.110 --> 00:41:05.070
It is almost,
almost in the range

00:41:05.070 --> 00:41:07.890
where you can identify
the sex of somebody

00:41:07.890 --> 00:41:10.440
by looking at the size of
this nucleus in their brain

00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:11.390
post-mortem.

00:41:11.390 --> 00:41:13.680
In rodents, you pretty much can.

00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:17.140
A very reliable two-fold
difference, males

00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:18.630
larger than females.

00:41:18.630 --> 00:41:21.880
As we'll hear in a while,
one really interesting

00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:23.500
exception to that.

00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:24.150
OK.

00:41:24.150 --> 00:41:28.150
So either some areas of the
brain that are preferentially

00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:31.000
involved and activated
by sexual behavior,

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:34.320
depending on your gender,
or regions that differ in

00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:36.660
size substantially
by your gender.

00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:38.430
But then, at the end
of the day, there's

00:41:38.430 --> 00:41:40.930
all sorts of things that
are absolutely in common.

00:41:40.930 --> 00:41:45.250
Again, the physiology of
orgasm, exactly the same.

00:41:45.250 --> 00:41:48.810
What clinically the
picture is is males having

00:41:48.810 --> 00:41:50.460
problems with the whole system.

00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:54.110
The problem tends to be
too rapid of a transition

00:41:54.110 --> 00:41:56.550
from parasympathetic
to sympathetic.

00:41:56.550 --> 00:41:59.540
In other words, the world
of premature ejaculation.

00:41:59.540 --> 00:42:02.050
The more typical
medical problem in women

00:42:02.050 --> 00:42:05.390
is failure of the
transition from

00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:09.120
parasympathetic to sympathetic,
inability to reach orgasm.

00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:13.540
And it is, of course, a huge
social, cultural, political,

00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:15.860
philosophical
argument whether that

00:42:15.860 --> 00:42:19.860
counts as a pathology or
normal human variability.

00:42:19.860 --> 00:42:21.840
I'm not going anywhere
near that one.

00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:25.440
But nonetheless, that is
the more common pattern.

00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:28.460
Neurobiology that's
absolutely in common

00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:31.510
between the sexes, which
is all of that stuff

00:42:31.510 --> 00:42:34.870
at the very beginning of why
are they in such a rush at end,

00:42:34.870 --> 00:42:40.360
the neurobiology of pleasure,
and the neurobiology of reward,

00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:42.200
and of anticipation.

00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:44.690
And this is this
whole world of-- as we

00:42:44.690 --> 00:42:46.800
know already-- dopamine.

00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:49.520
The role of dopamine
in sexual behavior

00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:52.130
is virtually identical
in both sexes, which

00:42:52.130 --> 00:42:55.510
is to say it plays a huge role.

00:42:55.510 --> 00:42:58.760
You find circumstances
where you deplete dopamine

00:42:58.760 --> 00:43:00.320
from the relevant
brain regions--

00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:02.980
back to last Friday--
limbic system.

00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:05.760
You remember that
ventral tegmental area,

00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:08.170
which sends that big
dopaminergic projection

00:43:08.170 --> 00:43:11.500
to the nucleus accumbens,
which then passes it

00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:14.180
on to all sorts of
places in the brain.

00:43:14.180 --> 00:43:17.240
Deplete that
pathway of dopamine,

00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:20.230
and you're not going to
get a whole lot of interest

00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:21.750
in sexual behavior.

00:43:21.750 --> 00:43:26.040
You're not going to get a whole
lot of libido proceptivity.

00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:28.680
What's the classic
circumstance where

00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:30.880
you see depletion
of dopamine there

00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:34.000
and loss of proceptive libido?

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:35.590
Clinical depression.

00:43:35.590 --> 00:43:38.270
That's one of the defining
symptoms of depression

00:43:38.270 --> 00:43:41.290
amid the various numerous
forms of pleasure

00:43:41.290 --> 00:43:42.820
that go down the tubes.

00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:46.990
Loss of sexual interest, one
of the defining symptoms.

00:43:46.990 --> 00:43:48.570
So the dopamine system.

00:43:48.570 --> 00:43:50.760
The general term
given for that is

00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:55.030
the mesolimbic dopamine
system to distinguish it

00:43:55.030 --> 00:43:57.890
from some of the other ways that
dopamine is used in the brain.

00:43:57.890 --> 00:44:00.490
The mesolimbic
dopamine system is

00:44:00.490 --> 00:44:04.350
absolutely central to
the reinforcing aspects

00:44:04.350 --> 00:44:06.340
of sexual behavior.

00:44:06.340 --> 00:44:07.940
So what's the evidence for that?

00:44:07.940 --> 00:44:10.100
First off, back to
that distinction

00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:12.810
that I think I brought up
last week-- I wasn't paying

00:44:12.810 --> 00:44:14.920
attention-- but I
think I talked about,

00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:17.330
which is the dopamine
system there is not

00:44:17.330 --> 00:44:21.340
so much about reward, it's about
the anticipation of reward.

00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:23.410
Did I talk about that in
monkeys pressing levers?

00:44:23.410 --> 00:44:23.910
Yes.

00:44:23.910 --> 00:44:24.460
OK.

00:44:24.460 --> 00:44:27.716
I should probably read the
extended notes at some point

00:44:27.716 --> 00:44:29.740
or look at the film of this.

00:44:29.740 --> 00:44:30.320
OK.

00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:32.380
What you see there
is the dopamine

00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:34.620
is about the anticipation of.

00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:37.940
And the dopamine,
as we heard, is

00:44:37.940 --> 00:44:43.750
about also fueling the behaviors
needed to achieve the reward.

00:44:43.750 --> 00:44:46.760
Dopamine in this
mesolimbic pathway

00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:49.760
as driving
goal-directed behavior.

00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:52.340
And that is certainly the
case with sexual behavior.

00:44:52.340 --> 00:44:56.600
By now, there is a whole
literature involving humans

00:44:56.600 --> 00:44:58.660
where you stick them
in brain scanners

00:44:58.660 --> 00:45:01.490
and you do something
or other sexually

00:45:01.490 --> 00:45:04.750
arousing or interesting or
something or other to them.

00:45:04.750 --> 00:45:07.950
And then you see what parts
of the brain activate.

00:45:07.950 --> 00:45:12.250
And it's these dopamine pathways
consistently way up there.

00:45:12.250 --> 00:45:15.950
Showing just how subtle
this can be, how's this?

00:45:15.950 --> 00:45:19.720
You take men-- there's been a
whole literature by now showing

00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:23.410
that you present people in
brain scanners with pornography.

00:45:23.410 --> 00:45:26.360
And that must have been a really
interesting in human subjects

00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:27.950
release form you worked out.

00:45:27.950 --> 00:45:30.660
But showing in both sexes,
what you tend to see

00:45:30.660 --> 00:45:33.760
is activation of
dopaminergic regions.

00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:36.090
We will hear in a little
while a sex difference

00:45:36.090 --> 00:45:39.090
in that domain that will
probably not surprise anyone.

00:45:39.090 --> 00:45:41.220
But how's this for subtle?

00:45:41.220 --> 00:45:44.510
You take a guy, and you
show him the picture

00:45:44.510 --> 00:45:48.100
of someone of the opposite
sex if he is heterosexual.

00:45:48.100 --> 00:45:50.100
And you show him the
picture of this individual.

00:45:50.100 --> 00:45:54.140
And if it is someone who he
assesses as being attractive,

00:45:54.140 --> 00:45:57.160
you don't necessarily get
this dopaminergic pathway

00:45:57.160 --> 00:45:58.250
to activate.

00:45:58.250 --> 00:45:59.440
It depends.

00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:03.240
What this study showed was
if the person is making what

00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:06.870
would pass for eye contact, if
they were looking straight out,

00:46:06.870 --> 00:46:08.800
the dopamine system activates.

00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:12.150
And if they're looking
elsewhere, it doesn't activate.

00:46:12.150 --> 00:46:15.370
How's that for a classic
male sort of responsiveness?

00:46:15.370 --> 00:46:17.650
If it looks as if this
attractive person is

00:46:17.650 --> 00:46:19.490
looking at you, it activates.

00:46:19.490 --> 00:46:21.910
Even more distressingly
from this study,

00:46:21.910 --> 00:46:24.260
when you show men--
on the average,

00:46:24.260 --> 00:46:26.230
blah, blah--
pictures of women who

00:46:26.230 --> 00:46:29.350
they would rate as
being unattractive,

00:46:29.350 --> 00:46:31.950
it's when they're looking
away that the dopamine system

00:46:31.950 --> 00:46:33.360
activates.

00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:35.040
Oh my god!

00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:37.090
What is going on here?

00:46:37.090 --> 00:46:39.300
This is pitiful.

00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:43.050
What also has been shown is
the exact same eye contact

00:46:43.050 --> 00:46:47.530
phenomenon of gay men looking
at pictures of attractive men.

00:46:47.530 --> 00:46:50.340
Another theme we're going
to see over and over, which

00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:53.430
is sexual orientation
being pretty much

00:46:53.430 --> 00:46:55.680
trivial in terms of
how it influences

00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:57.300
some of this neurobiology.

00:46:57.300 --> 00:46:59.600
Just switch the gender
of the other individual,

00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:02.100
and it works exactly the same.

00:47:02.100 --> 00:47:05.780
Now when you look at this
business about dopamine rising

00:47:05.780 --> 00:47:09.430
in anticipation of a reward
rather than a response

00:47:09.430 --> 00:47:12.860
to the reward itself, it
brings up one of the-- it

00:47:12.860 --> 00:47:14.720
doesn't bring that
up-- it brings up

00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:17.000
one of the all-time
interesting studies

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.080
that was published
about a decade ago.

00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:19.580
OK.

00:47:19.580 --> 00:47:21.730
So the paradigm I
described last week,

00:47:21.730 --> 00:47:24.640
you put on the light, which
tells the monkey that,

00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:26.950
OK, we're starting
one of those sessions

00:47:26.950 --> 00:47:29.090
where if you press
the levers adequately,

00:47:29.090 --> 00:47:30.380
you will get a reward.

00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:33.120
And they now carry
out this behavior.

00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:35.050
And as a result, they
get the reward here.

00:47:35.050 --> 00:47:38.230
And as we saw, dopamine
doesn't go up after the reward.

00:47:38.230 --> 00:47:40.450
It goes up at this point.

00:47:40.450 --> 00:47:43.240
This is the I how to do this.

00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:44.420
This is going to be great.

00:47:44.420 --> 00:47:45.300
This is terrific.

00:47:45.300 --> 00:47:47.400
Here's where you get
the rise in dopamine.

00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:50.040
This is not only
the anticipation,

00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:52.350
but if you don't
have this rise, you

00:47:52.350 --> 00:47:55.340
don't get the behavior,
the goal-directed behavior.

00:47:55.340 --> 00:47:58.490
Now in this brilliant
study, what they did

00:47:58.490 --> 00:48:00.810
was transition from
a paradigm where,

00:48:00.810 --> 00:48:04.710
OK, the monkey presses the lever
10 times and gets the reward.

00:48:04.710 --> 00:48:07.490
Now what you do is
the monkey works,

00:48:07.490 --> 00:48:11.170
and it gets the reward
only half the time.

00:48:11.170 --> 00:48:16.390
It gets only a 50% reward
rate unpredictably.

00:48:16.390 --> 00:48:18.690
And what happens to dopamine?

00:48:18.690 --> 00:48:19.700
OK.

00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:20.550
Got your choice.

00:48:20.550 --> 00:48:21.600
What's your vote?

00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:24.820
It doesn't rise as much.

00:48:24.820 --> 00:48:28.520
It rises the exact same amount.

00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:30.780
It rises even higher.

00:48:30.780 --> 00:48:31.390
OK.

00:48:31.390 --> 00:48:34.630
You guys all understand
anticipation and goal--

00:48:34.630 --> 00:48:35.900
it does this.

00:48:35.900 --> 00:48:37.610
It's one of the
biggest rises you

00:48:37.610 --> 00:48:40.640
will find in dopamine in
the brain short of cocaine.

00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:43.910
What have you just
introduced into there?

00:48:43.910 --> 00:48:45.830
This is, I'm all over it.

00:48:45.830 --> 00:48:46.970
I know how this works.

00:48:46.970 --> 00:48:48.130
This is going to be great.

00:48:48.130 --> 00:48:49.840
I have mastery and control.

00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:52.220
I am the captain of
my own lever pressing.

00:48:52.220 --> 00:48:53.690
This is all about that.

00:48:53.690 --> 00:48:55.460
What's this about?

00:48:55.460 --> 00:48:57.230
This is what dopamine
does when you've

00:48:57.230 --> 00:49:00.550
introduced the word
maybe into the equation.

00:49:00.550 --> 00:49:04.510
And that is incredibly
reinforcing.

00:49:04.510 --> 00:49:09.020
And people will work like
mad in contexts of maybe

00:49:09.020 --> 00:49:12.770
far more so than when they
work in contexts of certainty.

00:49:12.770 --> 00:49:14.990
Psychologists have
known this forever.

00:49:14.990 --> 00:49:17.730
This is intermittent
reinforcement.

00:49:17.730 --> 00:49:20.730
You never get more
behavior out of an organism

00:49:20.730 --> 00:49:23.940
than when you have
introduced a maybe into it.

00:49:23.940 --> 00:49:26.020
And part of the
brilliance of this study

00:49:26.020 --> 00:49:27.750
was what they then did.

00:49:27.750 --> 00:49:31.920
Now animals either got
reward 25% of the time

00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:34.860
or 75% of the time.

00:49:34.860 --> 00:49:37.170
On a certain level,
these are diametrically

00:49:37.170 --> 00:49:38.690
opposite manipulations.

00:49:38.690 --> 00:49:40.244
In one, you're
getting more rewards.

00:49:40.244 --> 00:49:41.660
In the other,
you're getting less.

00:49:41.660 --> 00:49:43.910
What's the thing
they have in common?

00:49:43.910 --> 00:49:48.210
They both had smaller
maybes than the 50% version.

00:49:48.210 --> 00:49:51.670
And what you see is it
would look like this.

00:49:51.670 --> 00:49:57.680
100%, 25% or 75%, 50%
maximizing the maybe.

00:49:57.680 --> 00:49:59.850
And one of the most
brilliant things

00:49:59.850 --> 00:50:02.820
that various social
engineers do with humans

00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:06.770
is convince people that there's
a 50% maybe when it is not

00:50:06.770 --> 00:50:08.490
50% in the slightest.

00:50:08.490 --> 00:50:10.890
That's what Las Vegas is about.

00:50:10.890 --> 00:50:14.670
That's an entire world of very
smart psychologists making

00:50:14.670 --> 00:50:17.170
people think in
circumstances where there's

00:50:17.170 --> 00:50:21.450
like one tenth of 1% of a maybe
going on there that is actually

00:50:21.450 --> 00:50:22.700
a 50%.

00:50:22.700 --> 00:50:25.950
And when you do that, you
get dopamine like crazy,

00:50:25.950 --> 00:50:28.550
and you get
goal-directed behavior

00:50:28.550 --> 00:50:32.080
as a result. Really,
really powerful.

00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:35.910
And this is so strongly the case
that this explains an extremely

00:50:35.910 --> 00:50:38.750
cynical thing that a
guy I knew in my dorm

00:50:38.750 --> 00:50:40.610
back when used to
say all the time.

00:50:40.610 --> 00:50:42.990
How's this for like a
dispirited view of what

00:50:42.990 --> 00:50:47.250
life is like, but possibly
absolutely accurate, which is,

00:50:47.250 --> 00:50:51.102
a relationship is the price you
pay for the anticipation of it.

00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:55.280
How's that for a grim worldview?

00:50:55.280 --> 00:50:55.860
Go figure.

00:50:55.860 --> 00:50:59.590
This guy had-- what a string
of disastrous relationships.

00:50:59.590 --> 00:51:03.380
But what you see here
is introduce a maybe,

00:51:03.380 --> 00:51:05.910
and it is very, very powerful.

00:51:05.910 --> 00:51:09.910
One final piece of the dopamine
system here that is pertinent,

00:51:09.910 --> 00:51:12.170
which is, as you
might expect from all

00:51:12.170 --> 00:51:14.600
of our molecular
biology stuff, there's

00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:18.450
all sorts of different
dopamine receptor subtypes.

00:51:18.450 --> 00:51:21.910
And two of them are pertinent
to this world of sexual behavior

00:51:21.910 --> 00:51:25.900
and reward, what is called
the shockingly the D1 dopamine

00:51:25.900 --> 00:51:28.610
receptor and the D2
dopamine receptor.

00:51:28.610 --> 00:51:32.720
And what studies show is
in monogamous species, what

00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:36.700
happens is right after mating,
when a pair bond is first

00:51:36.700 --> 00:51:41.390
formed, the second that's over
with, levels of the D2 receptor

00:51:41.390 --> 00:51:42.530
go way down.

00:51:42.530 --> 00:51:46.080
You down regulate the
levels of the receptor,

00:51:46.080 --> 00:51:50.130
and you up regulate the
levels of the D1 receptor.

00:51:50.130 --> 00:51:51.740
What's that about?

00:51:51.740 --> 00:51:56.160
If you drive down the D2
levels before they even mate,

00:51:56.160 --> 00:51:59.230
they don't form a pair bond.

00:51:59.230 --> 00:52:03.050
If you prevent the decline in
the D2's after they've mated

00:52:03.050 --> 00:52:07.780
and pair bonded or if you
prevent the rise in the D1's,

00:52:07.780 --> 00:52:08.840
they'll pair bond.

00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:10.440
And then, 8 and
1/2 minutes later,

00:52:10.440 --> 00:52:12.950
they will go and pair
bond with somebody else.

00:52:12.950 --> 00:52:18.380
The D2's seem to mediate the
rewarding anticipatory aspects

00:52:18.380 --> 00:52:19.750
of pair bonding.

00:52:19.750 --> 00:52:22.610
The D1's, on a certain
rodential level,

00:52:22.610 --> 00:52:26.600
seem to mediate the pleasure
of the monogamous, the truly

00:52:26.600 --> 00:52:28.880
monogamous features
of the pair bond.

00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:32.160
So a very interesting
interaction between the two.

00:52:32.160 --> 00:52:32.660
OK.

00:52:32.660 --> 00:52:34.800
One last thing about
dopamine, and this one

00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:38.070
is like even more depressing
than relationships

00:52:38.070 --> 00:52:39.300
are the price you pay.

00:52:39.300 --> 00:52:42.980
This was a study which
was really like someday

00:52:42.980 --> 00:52:44.840
may come to haunt you majorly.

00:52:44.840 --> 00:52:46.610
And in this study,
what they did--

00:52:46.610 --> 00:52:49.430
it was another one of those
brain imaging study ones.

00:52:49.430 --> 00:52:51.880
And what they did was they
took people in two categories.

00:52:51.880 --> 00:52:53.940
In both cases,
these are people who

00:52:53.940 --> 00:52:58.050
had found their beloved,
their beloved, the person who

00:52:58.050 --> 00:53:00.990
was their soul mate,
the person in whose arms

00:53:00.990 --> 00:53:03.560
they were going to die
someday, the person.

00:53:03.560 --> 00:53:05.440
And they divided it
between these two groups.

00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:08.000
One was a group where they had
known the person in whose arms

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:10.520
they were going to die
for like 2 and 1/2 weeks.

00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:12.510
And the other is when
they had been together

00:53:12.510 --> 00:53:14.620
for more than five years.

00:53:14.620 --> 00:53:18.230
So you put somebody
in the brain scanner,

00:53:18.230 --> 00:53:21.480
and you start flashing up
at speed, subliminal speeds,

00:53:21.480 --> 00:53:23.843
of pictures of
individuals they know.

00:53:23.843 --> 00:53:25.750
Important control in the study.

00:53:25.750 --> 00:53:28.920
And embedded in there is a
picture of their beloved.

00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:30.620
And suddenly, somewhere
along the way,

00:53:30.620 --> 00:53:32.830
up flashes the picture
of their beloved.

00:53:32.830 --> 00:53:37.230
Be in a short-term relationship
and the dopamine system

00:53:37.230 --> 00:53:40.630
goes crazy and
activates like mad.

00:53:40.630 --> 00:53:43.100
Now, you come back
five years later

00:53:43.100 --> 00:53:45.440
into that same relationship
with the beloved,

00:53:45.440 --> 00:53:47.250
and you do the exact same thing.

00:53:47.250 --> 00:53:50.540
And you flash up their picture,
and the dopamine system

00:53:50.540 --> 00:53:51.750
doesn't activate.

00:53:51.750 --> 00:53:55.680
What activates instead was
that anterior cingulate thing

00:53:55.680 --> 00:53:59.610
we heard about on Friday
having to do with empathy,

00:53:59.610 --> 00:54:02.210
and comfort, and all of that.

00:54:02.210 --> 00:54:05.920
In other words, what we see here
is the neurochemical transition

00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:09.140
from one's beloved
from causing your blood

00:54:09.140 --> 00:54:12.420
to run scalding hot
to your beloved being

00:54:12.420 --> 00:54:14.580
like a comfortable old armchair.

00:54:14.580 --> 00:54:17.830
This is one depressing study.

00:54:17.830 --> 00:54:21.260
So let's take a five-minute
break to contemplate that one.

00:54:21.260 --> 00:54:21.760
OK.

00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:22.760
And then we will resume.

00:54:27.850 --> 00:54:31.450
Lots of good questions
just now during the break.

00:54:31.450 --> 00:54:33.750
Disappointingly few
along the lines of,

00:54:33.750 --> 00:54:35.680
I've got a friend who.

00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:37.370
So not a bunch of those.

00:54:37.370 --> 00:54:38.054
But let's see.

00:54:38.054 --> 00:54:38.970
A number of questions.

00:54:38.970 --> 00:54:42.370
First one, can I repeat what
I said about the D1 and the D2

00:54:42.370 --> 00:54:43.410
receptors?

00:54:43.410 --> 00:54:44.020
OK.

00:54:44.020 --> 00:54:47.230
These are different types
of receptors for dopamine.

00:54:47.230 --> 00:54:50.590
In other words, they all respond
to the same neurotransmitter

00:54:50.590 --> 00:54:53.420
dopamine, but in different ways.

00:54:53.420 --> 00:54:56.320
And these receptors are found
on different neuron types.

00:54:56.320 --> 00:54:58.810
So you're getting into all
sorts of different pathways.

00:54:58.810 --> 00:55:03.480
What you see is, in rodents,
in pair bonding rodents,

00:55:03.480 --> 00:55:05.570
they better have
elevated levels,

00:55:05.570 --> 00:55:09.160
they better have D2
receptors on neurons

00:55:09.160 --> 00:55:12.470
being fed by this mesolimbic
reward dopamine pathway.

00:55:12.470 --> 00:55:17.720
They have to have D2 receptors
to form the pair bond

00:55:17.720 --> 00:55:20.970
for the attachment to occur.

00:55:20.970 --> 00:55:25.770
The second that happens, you
need to have low levels of D2

00:55:25.770 --> 00:55:30.820
and high levels of D1 to remain
faithful in your pair bonded

00:55:30.820 --> 00:55:31.950
relationship.

00:55:31.950 --> 00:55:34.930
So what you see in these voles
is right after the pair bond

00:55:34.930 --> 00:55:39.020
occurs, there's down regulation
of the D2's and up regulation

00:55:39.020 --> 00:55:40.200
of the D1's.

00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:42.390
And if you prevent
that from happening,

00:55:42.390 --> 00:55:46.164
the pair bond that's been
formed does not prove lasting.

00:55:46.164 --> 00:55:47.580
So that's what I
was saying there.

00:55:47.580 --> 00:55:49.850
Somebody brought up
the great question,

00:55:49.850 --> 00:55:52.470
which I was going to say
something about and forgot,

00:55:52.470 --> 00:55:56.370
which is, well, how
about like the D2 D1

00:55:56.370 --> 00:56:00.410
ratios in humans and their
sexual behavior stuff?

00:56:00.410 --> 00:56:03.130
And there's been
one study showing

00:56:03.130 --> 00:56:06.230
that a higher ratio
of D2 to D1 predicts

00:56:06.230 --> 00:56:08.290
more stable relationships.

00:56:08.290 --> 00:56:09.550
Small effect.

00:56:09.550 --> 00:56:11.030
Not replicated yet.

00:56:11.030 --> 00:56:14.640
But nonetheless, that's
kind of interesting.

00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:17.860
So on a certain
level then, D2 seems

00:56:17.860 --> 00:56:20.070
to be required, at
least shown in rodents.

00:56:20.070 --> 00:56:21.170
Who knows about us?

00:56:21.170 --> 00:56:24.270
D2 is about the formation
of the attachment.

00:56:24.270 --> 00:56:28.410
D1 is about the maintenance
of it, the faithfulness of it,

00:56:28.410 --> 00:56:29.550
if you will.

00:56:29.550 --> 00:56:31.540
Next, somebody
bringing up the issue

00:56:31.540 --> 00:56:33.800
in terms of female orgasm.

00:56:33.800 --> 00:56:37.090
Maybe what female orgasm is
about is a mate selection

00:56:37.090 --> 00:56:42.310
mechanism, as in
individuals who increase

00:56:42.310 --> 00:56:44.500
your likelihood of
having orgasms are ones

00:56:44.500 --> 00:56:48.810
you are more likely to
lower your D2 receptors for.

00:56:48.810 --> 00:56:50.430
But the one problem
with that one

00:56:50.430 --> 00:56:52.650
that makes wonderful sense--
what the studies tend

00:56:52.650 --> 00:56:55.100
to show though is the
likelihood of orgasm

00:56:55.100 --> 00:56:58.360
is much more a function
of who the female is

00:56:58.360 --> 00:57:01.640
than who the male is that they
are with, arguing against that.

00:57:01.640 --> 00:57:02.350
Let's see.

00:57:02.350 --> 00:57:03.630
Finally-- no.

00:57:03.630 --> 00:57:04.130
Not that.

00:57:04.130 --> 00:57:04.290
OK.

00:57:04.290 --> 00:57:05.450
So we already covered that.

00:57:05.450 --> 00:57:07.720
And there was one
additional question.

00:57:07.720 --> 00:57:08.220
OK.

00:57:08.220 --> 00:57:10.550
So what's the driving
force in terms

00:57:10.550 --> 00:57:14.020
of the proximal reinforcing
pleasurable aspects

00:57:14.020 --> 00:57:15.330
of sexual behavior?

00:57:15.330 --> 00:57:17.490
What's up with why
only some species--

00:57:17.490 --> 00:57:20.680
us predominantly-- have
non-reproductive sex,

00:57:20.680 --> 00:57:23.220
can have sex all the
time, versus other species

00:57:23.220 --> 00:57:25.010
that only do for reproduction?

00:57:25.010 --> 00:57:27.640
What that means is
in other species,

00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:31.320
the endocrinology of
ovulation is the thing

00:57:31.320 --> 00:57:33.380
that makes sex pleasurable.

00:57:33.380 --> 00:57:35.440
And we will see shortly
what that's about.

00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:38.520
In females, it's the
hormones associated

00:57:38.520 --> 00:57:42.580
with ovulation that
sensitize various tactile

00:57:42.580 --> 00:57:48.470
receptors to respond in ways
that mediate proximal pleasure.

00:57:48.470 --> 00:57:51.720
And in males, it's
the female giving off,

00:57:51.720 --> 00:57:54.860
for example, the right
pheromones, the right releasing

00:57:54.860 --> 00:57:58.750
stimuli, driven by the
right hormone levels that

00:57:58.750 --> 00:58:03.020
constitute the proximal signal
of pleasurable anticipation.

00:58:03.020 --> 00:58:06.390
And what you find in humans
is it doesn't work that way.

00:58:06.390 --> 00:58:09.250
You do not need, for
example, in women

00:58:09.250 --> 00:58:13.360
the elevated levels of estrogen
typical of ovulation in order

00:58:13.360 --> 00:58:18.560
to have tactile responsiveness
to sexually arousing stimuli.

00:58:18.560 --> 00:58:19.890
Stay tuned though.

00:58:19.890 --> 00:58:23.290
It's easier though when
estrogen levels are higher.

00:58:23.290 --> 00:58:23.810
OK.

00:58:23.810 --> 00:58:26.520
Final brain region
relevant to all of this

00:58:26.520 --> 00:58:28.500
is the frontal cortex.

00:58:28.500 --> 00:58:32.230
We already got a first pass at
the frontal cortex last week.

00:58:32.230 --> 00:58:37.760
And frontal cortex regulating
your behavior, impulse control,

00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:40.360
all that sort of thing,
gratification postponement--

00:58:40.360 --> 00:58:43.260
this plays a large role
in sexual behavior.

00:58:43.260 --> 00:58:46.000
What's the easy
immediate explanation

00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:49.290
that one can come up with,
what the frontal cortex does

00:58:49.290 --> 00:58:54.050
is it makes you be appropriate
in your sexual behavior.

00:58:54.050 --> 00:58:56.490
It teaches you the
appropriate context.

00:58:56.490 --> 00:59:00.730
It teaches you what aspects
of proceptive sexual behavior

00:59:00.730 --> 00:59:02.920
is not a good idea.

00:59:02.920 --> 00:59:06.050
It keeps you from doing
things you would regret vastly

00:59:06.050 --> 00:59:06.920
afterward.

00:59:06.920 --> 00:59:08.980
That's a very easy
version of it.

00:59:08.980 --> 00:59:11.240
And commensurate
with that, you see

00:59:11.240 --> 00:59:13.540
lots of circumstances
of individuals

00:59:13.540 --> 00:59:17.190
with frontal cortical damage
doing highly inappropriate

00:59:17.190 --> 00:59:18.640
sexual behavior.

00:59:18.640 --> 00:59:22.030
One example of it, and one
of those horrifying things

00:59:22.030 --> 00:59:23.640
that can happen--
this was a case

00:59:23.640 --> 00:59:26.780
that actually happened in
a nursing home in Martinez

00:59:26.780 --> 00:59:28.830
in the East Bay a
number of years ago.

00:59:28.830 --> 00:59:32.490
This was a man in his 80s
who had had stroke damage

00:59:32.490 --> 00:59:34.710
to his frontal
cortex, who was found

00:59:34.710 --> 00:59:38.090
to have raped a woman
there, another 80-year-old

00:59:38.090 --> 00:59:39.930
with Alzheimer's disease.

00:59:39.930 --> 00:59:42.230
Damage the frontal
cortex, and all sorts

00:59:42.230 --> 00:59:45.790
of the, "this is not sexual
behavior that you do"

00:59:45.790 --> 00:59:48.260
constraints go down the tubes.

00:59:48.260 --> 00:59:51.380
Just as importantly though,
what the frontal cortex,

00:59:51.380 --> 00:59:53.620
with all of it's giving
you the discipline

00:59:53.620 --> 00:59:55.590
to do the right thing,
some of the time,

00:59:55.590 --> 00:59:57.630
what that takes the
form of is getting

00:59:57.630 --> 01:00:00.460
you to do proceptive
sexual behavior.

01:00:00.460 --> 01:00:03.080
For example, you
are trying to do

01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:06.730
some courtship of some
other antlered ungulate

01:00:06.730 --> 01:00:07.920
that you are courting.

01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:11.130
And this is terrifying because
there is another individual

01:00:11.130 --> 01:00:12.320
challenging you.

01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:13.960
And there's the
frontal cortex that

01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:17.480
is getting you to carry
out those sexual behaviors

01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:20.530
to that point, even if it is
a terrifying circumstance.

01:00:20.530 --> 01:00:23.750
Nonetheless, what the frontal
cortex mostly is about

01:00:23.750 --> 01:00:26.510
is reigning in sexual behavior.

01:00:26.510 --> 01:00:31.230
It's not changing the fixed
action patterns of sex.

01:00:31.230 --> 01:00:33.760
It's changing the context
in which the fixed action

01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:35.940
patterns occur.

01:00:35.940 --> 01:00:38.170
So now, we are ready
to look at one more

01:00:38.170 --> 01:00:40.260
feature of the
neurobiology, which

01:00:40.260 --> 01:00:44.370
is when somebody is having sex,
what hormonal responses are

01:00:44.370 --> 01:00:45.360
triggered?

01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:47.840
Notice this is not here.

01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:51.130
This is not what hormones
have to do with bringing

01:00:51.130 --> 01:00:52.700
about sexual behavior.

01:00:52.700 --> 01:00:57.910
This is, what are the hormonal
responses to sexual behavior?

01:00:57.910 --> 01:01:02.470
Starting off in females,
including human females,

01:01:02.470 --> 01:01:05.530
having sex increases
secretion of

01:01:05.530 --> 01:01:07.850
progesterone-derived hormones.

01:01:07.850 --> 01:01:12.960
And that has something to do
with reinforcing the pleasure.

01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:16.750
Interestingly, in females
the world over, having sex

01:01:16.750 --> 01:01:20.470
increases the level of
testosterone-related hormones

01:01:20.470 --> 01:01:22.550
in the bloodstream, androgens.

01:01:22.550 --> 01:01:26.760
Women, females, generate
androgens maybe 5%

01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:28.430
the levels you see in males.

01:01:28.430 --> 01:01:30.830
And they come out of
the adrenal glands.

01:01:30.830 --> 01:01:34.230
And they seem to play
a very central role

01:01:34.230 --> 01:01:39.120
in mediating sexual motivation,
sexual arousal, in females.

01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:40.340
How is that's shown?

01:01:40.340 --> 01:01:43.270
Obvious experimental
studies with lab rats.

01:01:43.270 --> 01:01:45.030
How is that's shown in humans?

01:01:45.030 --> 01:01:49.480
When women have any of a number
of types of diseases where you

01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:51.650
have to take out
the adrenal glands,

01:01:51.650 --> 01:01:55.140
sexual motivation, sexual
arousal, goes down.

01:01:55.140 --> 01:01:58.090
Give them replacement
androgens, and

01:01:58.090 --> 01:02:01.900
sexual arousal, sexual
proceptivity, returns, so

01:02:01.900 --> 01:02:04.490
androgens there playing a role.

01:02:04.490 --> 01:02:06.730
But probably most
importantly, in terms

01:02:06.730 --> 01:02:10.220
of hormones triggered by
sexual behavior in females,

01:02:10.220 --> 01:02:13.230
is the release of oxytocin.

01:02:13.230 --> 01:02:15.940
Oxytocin is really interesting.

01:02:15.940 --> 01:02:17.840
We've heard about
oxytocin twice already.

01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:21.640
One, is when it's coming out
of the posterior pituitary.

01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:24.660
And the second is that minor
business the other day,

01:02:24.660 --> 01:02:26.790
last Wednesday,
of oxytocin being

01:02:26.790 --> 01:02:29.570
another one of those
hypothalamic hormones that

01:02:29.570 --> 01:02:32.430
helps to release ACTH
from the pituitary.

01:02:32.430 --> 01:02:34.300
Remember, it doesn't
directly release.

01:02:34.300 --> 01:02:37.950
It's a modulator, a CRH action,
if-then clause, et cetera.

01:02:37.950 --> 01:02:40.950
But those are the two ways
we've heard about oxytocin.

01:02:40.950 --> 01:02:45.690
Oxytocin also works in the
brain as a neurotransmitter

01:02:45.690 --> 01:02:47.550
and neuromodulator.

01:02:47.550 --> 01:02:49.140
And what does it do there?

01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:52.080
It appears to play
a very central role

01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:55.680
in forming attachments,
a very central role

01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:57.780
in forming of pair bonds.

01:02:57.780 --> 01:03:01.040
And it, along with dopamine
and the D2 receptors,

01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:05.110
are critical for female
voles of monogamous species

01:03:05.110 --> 01:03:06.610
to form pair bonds.

01:03:06.610 --> 01:03:11.400
Female humans, when having
sex, secrete lots of oxytocin

01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:14.250
and activate oxytocin
pathways in the brain.

01:03:14.250 --> 01:03:19.040
And it appears to play a role
in the formation of attachment.

01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:22.950
Interestingly-- how's this--
a whole body of research

01:03:22.950 --> 01:03:26.750
now showing that if
you introduce oxytocin

01:03:26.750 --> 01:03:29.770
into the brains of
humans experimentally,

01:03:29.770 --> 01:03:32.900
they become more trusting.

01:03:32.900 --> 01:03:37.800
Amazing body of research where
you take aerosolized oxytocin

01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:40.180
and you spritz it
up people's noses.

01:03:40.180 --> 01:03:41.760
And what they showed
in the studies

01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:44.410
were, number one,
one type of study.

01:03:44.410 --> 01:03:48.360
You then play a clip of
somebody making an argument

01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:51.170
for some stance in
some debate, and people

01:03:51.170 --> 01:03:52.700
believe the person more.

01:03:52.700 --> 01:03:54.900
They find their argument
more convincing.

01:03:54.900 --> 01:03:56.770
They trust the person more.

01:03:56.770 --> 01:03:58.690
Or the other version
that's been shown

01:03:58.690 --> 01:04:01.800
is you spritz oxytocin
up the noses of people,

01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:04.820
and you make them more
cooperative in their game

01:04:04.820 --> 01:04:07.290
theory play, the
ways in which they

01:04:07.290 --> 01:04:10.450
go about playing prisoner's
dilemma and other games

01:04:10.450 --> 01:04:12.780
we will hear about
later on as well.

01:04:12.780 --> 01:04:16.770
This has given rise to a whole
new field-- I kid you not--

01:04:16.770 --> 01:04:19.450
called neuromarketing.

01:04:19.450 --> 01:04:22.880
The notion that if only you
could spritz oxytocin up

01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:26.730
the noses of people right before
your television ad comes on,

01:04:26.730 --> 01:04:29.150
they're going to believe
you when you say it

01:04:29.150 --> 01:04:31.800
will make you happy
to buy our thing.

01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:33.370
And they will fall for it.

01:04:33.370 --> 01:04:35.820
There are actually
neuroendocrinologists

01:04:35.820 --> 01:04:40.050
making a living now selling
their wares to neuromarketing

01:04:40.050 --> 01:04:42.950
people-- self-proclaimed ones.

01:04:42.950 --> 01:04:45.030
No doubt they are
spritzing oxytocin up

01:04:45.030 --> 01:04:48.270
the noses of those
capitalists to get

01:04:48.270 --> 01:04:49.840
them to hire them to do this.

01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:53.660
But oxytocin playing
a role in this.

01:04:53.660 --> 01:04:55.850
So that's kind of interesting.

01:04:55.850 --> 01:04:58.970
Because what's oxytocin
mostly doing in the body?

01:04:58.970 --> 01:05:01.820
The vast majority
of oxytocin is not

01:05:01.820 --> 01:05:04.130
this stuff up in the
brain in these pathways,

01:05:04.130 --> 01:05:07.690
some of them impinging on
dopamine-releasing neurons.

01:05:07.690 --> 01:05:11.000
The vast majority is not
the oxytocin sitting there

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.960
in the hypothalamus doing
something or other to ACTH

01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:15.100
in the pituitary.

01:05:15.100 --> 01:05:18.280
The vast majority is this stuff
coming out of the posterior

01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:19.460
pituitary.

01:05:19.460 --> 01:05:22.670
And what does oxytocin
have to do there?

01:05:22.670 --> 01:05:25.060
It has to do with milk letdown.

01:05:25.060 --> 01:05:27.120
It has to do with nursing.

01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:30.200
And suddenly, instead,
it's playing a role

01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:32.640
in forming sexual pair bonding.

01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:35.800
And the argument is
made that attachment,

01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:40.470
monogamous attachment, sexual
attachment, is in some way,

01:05:40.470 --> 01:05:44.020
evolutionarily a descendent
of the neurobiology

01:05:44.020 --> 01:05:46.660
of mother-offspring attachment.

01:05:46.660 --> 01:05:49.990
That that's where it is
originally being driven by.

01:05:49.990 --> 01:05:53.620
So oxytocin playing
a role there as well.

01:05:53.620 --> 01:05:56.580
Meanwhile, over at the
male end of things,

01:05:56.580 --> 01:05:58.990
up go testosterone
levels during sex.

01:05:58.990 --> 01:06:02.560
In a surprisingly linear
way, the more sexual behavior

01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:04.640
in a male, the higher
testosterone levels

01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:06.100
are found afterward.

01:06:06.100 --> 01:06:09.280
Critically, critically--
stay tuned for a little

01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:13.890
while-- these are elevations
of testosterone in response

01:06:13.890 --> 01:06:15.510
to sexual behavior.

01:06:15.510 --> 01:06:19.570
As we'll see, the evidence
that high testosterone levels

01:06:19.570 --> 01:06:24.500
make males more sexually active
is basically nonexistent.

01:06:24.500 --> 01:06:27.250
So critical, critical
proviso here.

01:06:27.250 --> 01:06:31.430
This is sex increasing
testosterone secretion, not

01:06:31.430 --> 01:06:33.440
the other way around.

01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:34.610
What else?

01:06:34.610 --> 01:06:37.590
Meanwhile, back to the
posterior pituitary.

01:06:37.590 --> 01:06:39.080
Was that a question?

01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:39.580
No.

01:06:39.580 --> 01:06:39.920
OK.

01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:41.030
That was a head scratch.

01:06:41.030 --> 01:06:41.590
OK.

01:06:41.590 --> 01:06:43.360
Back to the posterior pituitary.

01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:46.870
The other hormone coming
out from there, vasopressin.

01:06:46.870 --> 01:06:51.420
And oxytocin is to females
as vasopressin is to males.

01:06:51.420 --> 01:06:52.830
And we've already
heard something

01:06:52.830 --> 01:06:55.440
about this back in
the molecular genetics

01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:59.310
stuff in those if-then clauses
and unlikely ways in which you

01:06:59.310 --> 01:07:00.570
get mutations.

01:07:00.570 --> 01:07:04.620
vasopressin, vasopressin
also is found

01:07:04.620 --> 01:07:09.260
in the nervous system, where it
serves as neuromodulatory role.

01:07:09.260 --> 01:07:14.130
And vasopressin is critical
for forming a pair bond.

01:07:14.130 --> 01:07:16.220
Back to that business
about when you

01:07:16.220 --> 01:07:20.190
look at monogamous versus
polygamist species,

01:07:20.190 --> 01:07:21.510
what's going on?

01:07:21.510 --> 01:07:23.910
What you have uniquely
in the monogamous

01:07:23.910 --> 01:07:27.830
species is expression of
the vasopressin receptor

01:07:27.830 --> 01:07:32.731
gene on neurons that
released dopamine.

01:07:32.731 --> 01:07:36.810
In other words, male
secrete vasopressin.

01:07:36.810 --> 01:07:41.320
And if you are of a species
where vasopressin now goes

01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:45.540
and stimulates dopamine
neurons, you decide you really,

01:07:45.540 --> 01:07:48.720
really, really liked having
sex with this other vole.

01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:50.720
And you come back for more.

01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:54.520
And that's the driving force on
the formation of the pair bond.

01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:57.480
Incredible studies
showing that if you

01:07:57.480 --> 01:08:00.630
take male voles from
the polygamist species

01:08:00.630 --> 01:08:03.070
and, due to gene
transfer techniques--

01:08:03.070 --> 01:08:04.720
I've mentioned the
study already--

01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:08.220
but you now stick
vasopressin receptors

01:08:08.220 --> 01:08:12.050
into those dopamine neurons,
those polygamist males

01:08:12.050 --> 01:08:14.520
now become pair bonding males.

01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:16.810
They now become monogamous.

01:08:16.810 --> 01:08:19.319
So really interesting.

01:08:19.319 --> 01:08:21.960
What you then see
in these studies is

01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:24.960
you look at these monogamous
species where the males have

01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:27.750
vasopressin receptors on
these dopamine neurons,

01:08:27.750 --> 01:08:29.899
and you look at
individual males,

01:08:29.899 --> 01:08:32.290
and the ones who
have more receptors

01:08:32.290 --> 01:08:35.920
there are forming
pair bonds faster.

01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:38.620
It takes fewer rounds
of mating with a female

01:08:38.620 --> 01:08:41.229
to form a pair bond.

01:08:41.229 --> 01:08:43.510
So what about primates?

01:08:43.510 --> 01:08:46.960
So you start off looking at two
different primate species, one

01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:50.939
pair bonding, marmoset monkeys,
New World marmoset monkeys,

01:08:50.939 --> 01:08:53.479
and then one classic
tournament species,

01:08:53.479 --> 01:08:57.250
polygamous primate
species, rhesus monkeys.

01:08:57.250 --> 01:09:00.729
And what you see is
you've got the variant,

01:09:00.729 --> 01:09:04.830
the monogamous vole,
vasopressin receptor gene

01:09:04.830 --> 01:09:07.600
variant in the pair
bonding monkey species,

01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:08.830
in the marmosets.

01:09:08.830 --> 01:09:10.850
And you get the
polygamous version

01:09:10.850 --> 01:09:16.670
of the gene in the
rhesus monkeys.

01:09:16.670 --> 01:09:18.689
So it maps on there as well.

01:09:18.689 --> 01:09:22.240
So the more of this receptor
in these dopamine pathways

01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:25.140
within monogamous
species, the more rapidly

01:09:25.140 --> 01:09:26.810
they form a pair bond.

01:09:26.810 --> 01:09:30.960
And what you see is differences
in the mere presence of them

01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:34.990
in comparing pair bonding
versus non-pair bonding rodents

01:09:34.990 --> 01:09:37.600
and monkeys.

01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:40.020
So how about humans?

01:09:40.020 --> 01:09:43.189
First thing that comes
up is, among the apes,

01:09:43.189 --> 01:09:47.620
you also find the two
variants, the monogamous vole

01:09:47.620 --> 01:09:50.590
variant of the
vasopressin receptor gene

01:09:50.590 --> 01:09:53.450
and the polygamous male variant.

01:09:53.450 --> 01:09:55.380
So what species
do you see it in?

01:09:55.380 --> 01:09:59.510
In chimpanzees, you see
the polygamous vole species

01:09:59.510 --> 01:10:01.380
version.

01:10:01.380 --> 01:10:03.000
That makes lots of sense.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:06.430
They are a major polygamist
species in their behavior.

01:10:06.430 --> 01:10:08.740
But then, this
beautiful dichotomy

01:10:08.740 --> 01:10:12.260
comes crashing down
when you see that you've

01:10:12.260 --> 01:10:17.480
got the monogamous gene
version in bonobos.

01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:19.610
And as we will hear
about in a while,

01:10:19.610 --> 01:10:25.520
bonobos are the most
hyperpolygamously, hyper

01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:30.000
varietyish sexually behaving
organisms on the entire planet.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:33.220
They are as far as you could
get from a monogamous species

01:10:33.220 --> 01:10:36.180
as you can ever ask for,
if you ask for such things.

01:10:36.180 --> 01:10:40.110
And you've got the wrong type
of vasopressin receptor gene.

01:10:40.110 --> 01:10:42.610
Whatever is going on,
it's more complicated

01:10:42.610 --> 01:10:45.340
than the have the
version that winds up

01:10:45.340 --> 01:10:47.260
on the dopamine
neurons and you are

01:10:47.260 --> 01:10:50.760
going to have 50th wedding
anniversaries if you are a vole

01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:52.320
or you are a marmoset.

01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:55.760
And it's got to be more
complicated than that.

01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:57.690
So how about humans?

01:10:57.690 --> 01:11:00.350
And what you see
is not explicitly

01:11:00.350 --> 01:11:03.600
as much genetic
variability as some people

01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:06.080
having the monogamous vole
version and some people

01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:07.120
have the polygamist.

01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:09.440
But nonetheless,
you get variation.

01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:13.250
The gene basically is
about halfway in between.

01:11:13.250 --> 01:11:13.790
Whoa.

01:11:13.790 --> 01:11:16.790
We keep having that
theme over and over,

01:11:16.790 --> 01:11:20.500
all these different ways
of looking at body size,

01:11:20.500 --> 01:11:23.350
and sexual dimorphism,
and imprinted genes,

01:11:23.350 --> 01:11:24.470
and all that stuff.

01:11:24.470 --> 01:11:27.280
And humans keep winding
up being about a halfway

01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:29.450
between a classic
monogamous pair

01:11:29.450 --> 01:11:32.790
bonder and a classic
polygamist tournament species.

01:11:32.790 --> 01:11:36.780
So the basic human version of
it is somewhere in between.

01:11:36.780 --> 01:11:38.600
But you get variations.

01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:41.760
You've got genetic variations
that either look a little bit

01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:45.710
more like the monogamous vole
version or the polygamous vole

01:11:45.710 --> 01:11:46.670
version.

01:11:46.670 --> 01:11:49.810
And what studies have now
shown-- two different studies

01:11:49.810 --> 01:11:54.010
independently showing this--
have the monogamous vole

01:11:54.010 --> 01:11:54.950
version.

01:11:54.950 --> 01:11:59.690
And with the small effect, you
are more likely to get married,

01:11:59.690 --> 01:12:01.870
you are more likely
to remain married,

01:12:01.870 --> 01:12:03.960
and both you and
your partner are

01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:08.600
more likely to rate the
marriage as stable and happy.

01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:10.980
That's kind of interesting.

01:12:10.980 --> 01:12:14.260
Finally, in terms of
the role of vasopressin,

01:12:14.260 --> 01:12:17.380
in terms of attachment
in males, all of that,

01:12:17.380 --> 01:12:20.170
and in terms of
social connectiveness,

01:12:20.170 --> 01:12:22.930
a large body of
studies now have shown

01:12:22.930 --> 01:12:26.220
mutations in the
vasopressin receptor gene.

01:12:26.220 --> 01:12:26.720
OK.

01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:31.140
Anybody want to guess
what disorder you find it?

01:12:31.140 --> 01:12:33.724
I put that in the
extended notes, haven't I?

01:12:33.724 --> 01:12:34.890
People have read it already.

01:12:34.890 --> 01:12:36.350
I know, I fell for it last time.

01:12:36.350 --> 01:12:38.560
I am not falling for
that stupid trick

01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:41.810
again of asking you to prove.

01:12:41.810 --> 01:12:43.320
He sniffed some oxytocin.

01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:45.660
So does anybody want to
guess which the-- OK.

01:12:45.660 --> 01:12:48.160
What do you now all
know is there's now

01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:50.650
been a lot of
demonstrations of mutations

01:12:50.650 --> 01:12:53.360
in the vasopressin
receptor gene in family

01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:58.760
pedigrees with autism, a disease
of very, very little attachment

01:12:58.760 --> 01:13:00.050
to other humans.

01:13:00.050 --> 01:13:03.570
So we've got written
all over the place here

01:13:03.570 --> 01:13:08.940
some sort of role of oxytocin
in female attachment formation

01:13:08.940 --> 01:13:10.630
and vasopressin.

01:13:10.630 --> 01:13:12.680
And we've already
gotten interesting hints

01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:14.450
that this applies to humans.

01:13:14.450 --> 01:13:16.750
And we've already
gotten interesting hints

01:13:16.750 --> 01:13:20.120
that individual differences
in the molecular biology

01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:22.080
of these genes
predicts something

01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:26.120
about individual differences in
the stability of relationships

01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:28.030
in humans.

01:13:28.030 --> 01:13:28.530
OK.

01:13:28.850 --> 01:13:31.540
So everything we've been hearing
about with the neurobiology--

01:13:31.540 --> 01:13:34.110
and we're still living in
this part, in this bucket here

01:13:34.110 --> 01:13:36.020
temporarily-- has
been built around

01:13:36.020 --> 01:13:37.930
heterosexual relationships.

01:13:37.930 --> 01:13:40.130
What's known about
the neurobiology

01:13:40.130 --> 01:13:42.500
of sexual orientation?

01:13:42.500 --> 01:13:47.790
What has been found is most
strikingly one landmark study,

01:13:47.790 --> 01:13:50.920
one that got on the
cover of Time magazine,

01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:54.300
one that had a gigantic,
gigantic impact,

01:13:54.300 --> 01:13:57.640
which was looking back at
that hypothalamic nucleus,

01:13:57.640 --> 01:14:01.280
that INAH, I-N-A-H. Yes.

01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:03.850
Where what we saw
before was very reliably

01:14:03.850 --> 01:14:07.690
on the average, men, their
size of it is about twice

01:14:07.690 --> 01:14:09.360
the size as in women.

01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:12.120
And in other species,
males about twice

01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:14.040
the size as in females.

01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:16.610
And a study was
done in the late 80s

01:14:16.610 --> 01:14:19.470
by a neuroanatomist
names Simon LeVay.

01:14:19.470 --> 01:14:21.800
LeVay is one of the all-time
great neuroanatomists.

01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:24.250
He was trained by
Hubel and Wiesel,

01:14:24.250 --> 01:14:26.650
was a professor at
Harvard Med School

01:14:26.650 --> 01:14:29.110
for a while before moving
to the Salk Institute.

01:14:29.110 --> 01:14:31.880
And what he did was
look post-mortem

01:14:31.880 --> 01:14:34.630
at the brains of a bunch of
individuals where he knew

01:14:34.630 --> 01:14:36.900
the sexual orientation, men.

01:14:36.900 --> 01:14:41.180
And what he showed was gay
men, on the average, had

01:14:41.180 --> 01:14:45.270
this nucleus on the
average was half the size

01:14:45.270 --> 01:14:48.060
that you saw in
heterosexual men.

01:14:48.060 --> 01:14:50.940
On the average, it was
about the same size

01:14:50.940 --> 01:14:53.800
as you saw in
heterosexual women.

01:14:53.800 --> 01:14:56.330
Amazing landmark study.

01:14:56.330 --> 01:14:59.670
Everybody learned about
the homosexual brain

01:14:59.670 --> 01:15:00.800
from this study.

01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:03.850
Hugely widely reported.

01:15:03.850 --> 01:15:06.680
And this is kind of interesting.

01:15:06.680 --> 01:15:07.180
OK.

01:15:07.180 --> 01:15:08.360
What's interesting about it?

01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:12.690
First off, the question you need
to ask is how much variability?

01:15:12.690 --> 01:15:13.510
Fair amount.

01:15:13.510 --> 01:15:15.890
It wasn't all that
reliable of a difference.

01:15:15.890 --> 01:15:19.920
On the average, it was
about a half the size.

01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:21.295
Next thing you
would want to know

01:15:21.295 --> 01:15:24.480
is, has anybody
replicated it since then?

01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:25.830
Yes.

01:15:25.830 --> 01:15:27.340
Next thing you
would want to know

01:15:27.340 --> 01:15:30.180
is, where did LeVay
get the brains from?

01:15:30.180 --> 01:15:32.310
And these were
predominantly from gay men

01:15:32.310 --> 01:15:33.940
who had died of AIDS.

01:15:33.940 --> 01:15:35.570
Is that a confound?

01:15:35.570 --> 01:15:39.430
Is that going to perhaps
atrophy this part of the brain?

01:15:39.430 --> 01:15:40.540
Nobody knows.

01:15:40.540 --> 01:15:43.610
So that remains as a
caveat in that study.

01:15:43.610 --> 01:15:46.980
What was striking
though was everybody

01:15:46.980 --> 01:15:48.740
learned about this finding.

01:15:48.740 --> 01:15:50.370
This became famous.

01:15:50.370 --> 01:15:52.880
LeVay became extremely
famous for this.

01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:54.380
And what was also
very interesting

01:15:54.380 --> 01:15:57.950
about it was the political
context of this finding.

01:15:57.950 --> 01:16:00.750
A few years before
that, another group

01:16:00.750 --> 01:16:04.420
had reported another
difference in the hypothalamus

01:16:04.420 --> 01:16:06.520
based on sexual orientation.

01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:12.640
And this was-- there it is.

01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:15.100
And what you found was in
this part of the brain,

01:16:15.100 --> 01:16:20.210
on the average, it would tend
be bigger in women than in men.

01:16:20.210 --> 01:16:23.900
And what these guys
reported was in gay men,

01:16:23.900 --> 01:16:28.230
it tended to be bigger
than in straight men.

01:16:28.230 --> 01:16:30.010
What was puzzling
about the study

01:16:30.010 --> 01:16:32.730
was this was a part of
a hypothalamus having

01:16:32.730 --> 01:16:35.840
to do with regulation
of your kidneys.

01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:38.950
And it was totally ignored
and completely bizarre,

01:16:38.950 --> 01:16:40.540
except there was
one thing that was

01:16:40.540 --> 01:16:42.730
done with it, which
was this was viewed

01:16:42.730 --> 01:16:46.670
as a totally offensive
study in the gay community.

01:16:46.670 --> 01:16:49.160
This was viewed as an
attempt by scientists

01:16:49.160 --> 01:16:53.640
to pathologize sexual
orientation, to say, you see,

01:16:53.640 --> 01:16:58.130
we found something wrong in
the brains of homosexual men.

01:16:58.130 --> 01:17:01.410
This part of the brain is
bigger than it should be.

01:17:01.410 --> 01:17:03.400
It's bigger than
it's supposed to be.

01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:06.190
There's probably two
reasons why that occurred.

01:17:06.190 --> 01:17:09.730
The first one was that
the scientists who did it

01:17:09.730 --> 01:17:11.430
were straight.

01:17:11.430 --> 01:17:14.530
And the second reason being
that they were a Dutch group.

01:17:14.530 --> 01:17:17.260
And I am willing to
bet unconsciously there

01:17:17.260 --> 01:17:22.350
was something central European
Nazi echoes of Germanic

01:17:22.350 --> 01:17:25.490
sounding authors producing
this finding, which there

01:17:25.490 --> 01:17:28.750
is no shortage of history in
the gay community for being

01:17:28.750 --> 01:17:31.650
skittish about Nazi
notions of what normality

01:17:31.650 --> 01:17:34.350
is in human behavior
and human brains.

01:17:34.350 --> 01:17:38.650
This finding got widely
condemned in the gay community.

01:17:38.650 --> 01:17:43.820
Out came LeVay with his
finding, and he became the most

01:17:43.820 --> 01:17:48.600
beloved neuroanatomist ever in
the history of gay communities.

01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:51.310
One probably important
feature reason for it

01:17:51.310 --> 01:17:54.860
is that LeVay was
gay, very openly so.

01:17:54.860 --> 01:17:58.830
Another reason was the part of
the brain he found made sense.

01:17:58.830 --> 01:18:02.370
It had something to do with
sexual behavior as opposed

01:18:02.370 --> 01:18:04.710
to the totally puzzling thing.

01:18:04.710 --> 01:18:06.440
So what was this about?

01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:09.790
Very interestingly, the
explanation almost certainly

01:18:09.790 --> 01:18:12.780
is that this was the
part of the hypothalamus

01:18:12.780 --> 01:18:15.800
next door to the area
that LeVay studied.

01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:19.950
And if this part were
smaller in gay men

01:18:19.950 --> 01:18:23.380
simply because of just
physical constraints stuff,

01:18:23.380 --> 01:18:25.710
this part could get
bigger in gay men.

01:18:25.710 --> 01:18:27.890
Because this one was
taking up less area.

01:18:27.890 --> 01:18:29.800
That's probably
what was going on.

01:18:29.800 --> 01:18:33.820
What's really fascinating
though is the political context

01:18:33.820 --> 01:18:35.760
that this research was done in.

01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:38.970
And this was that first group,
the senior author of it,

01:18:38.970 --> 01:18:40.850
a man named Dick Schwab.

01:18:40.850 --> 01:18:44.730
And he got death threats
because of that study reporting,

01:18:44.730 --> 01:18:48.500
ooh, here is-- easily
interpreted as-- something

01:18:48.500 --> 01:18:51.380
wrong in the brains of gay man.

01:18:51.380 --> 01:18:55.120
And Simon LeVay became
the hero in the community.

01:18:55.120 --> 01:18:57.820
This was utterly embraced
by the community.

01:18:57.820 --> 01:19:00.990
Because in large part,
how it was interpreted as,

01:19:00.990 --> 01:19:02.730
this is biology.

01:19:02.730 --> 01:19:04.160
This isn't choice.

01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:05.510
This is biology.

01:19:05.510 --> 01:19:06.660
Look at this.

01:19:06.660 --> 01:19:09.250
This is ridiculous,
us saying, oh my god.

01:19:09.250 --> 01:19:11.440
If we have gay teachers
in the classroom,

01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:14.880
we will turn the Boy Scouts
of America into a gay men.

01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:18.050
Oh my god, if we have blue-eyed
teachers in the classroom--

01:19:18.050 --> 01:19:22.380
the usual argument that this is
absolute gibberish to demonize

01:19:22.380 --> 01:19:24.290
sexual orientation as a choice.

01:19:24.290 --> 01:19:24.910
Look at this.

01:19:24.910 --> 01:19:26.960
There's a neurobiology of it.

01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:31.020
And this was sufficiently that
I've seen people in the Castro

01:19:31.020 --> 01:19:33.550
District in San Francisco--
this has disappeared somewhat,

01:19:33.550 --> 01:19:36.290
showing the half life of
neuroanatomical knowledge.

01:19:36.290 --> 01:19:38.959
But during that time, people
in the Castro District up

01:19:38.959 --> 01:19:41.000
in the city there, which
is a very gay community,

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:44.400
I have seen people with
t-shirts saying-- the other term

01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:47.930
people never really wanted
to embrace this INAH,

01:19:47.930 --> 01:19:51.050
so its nickname was the
sexually dimorphic nucleus

01:19:51.050 --> 01:19:52.450
of the hypothalamus.

01:19:52.450 --> 01:19:54.430
And I have seen people
with t-shirts saying,

01:19:54.430 --> 01:19:58.025
the only small thing about me is
my sexually dimorphic nucleus.

01:20:00.530 --> 01:20:02.950
They were actually
selling t-shirts

01:20:02.950 --> 01:20:06.690
that would say this during
gay pride parades around 1990

01:20:06.690 --> 01:20:07.410
or so.

01:20:07.410 --> 01:20:10.000
Isn't it great when
people learn neuroanatomy

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.140
out in the general public there?

01:20:12.140 --> 01:20:12.840
OK.

01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:15.950
So an interesting
brain difference

01:20:15.950 --> 01:20:18.880
confounded by people
who died of AIDS.

01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:20.960
It's still not clear
what that means

01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:23.850
in terms of possibly
negating the finding at least

01:20:23.850 --> 01:20:25.440
independently replicated.

01:20:25.440 --> 01:20:27.600
Fascinating piece
of not science,

01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:30.320
but the political
context of science.

01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:34.360
This politically incorrect
to an extreme, this very,

01:20:34.360 --> 01:20:36.000
very widely embraced.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.920
One interesting thing is
that paper by LeVay of

01:20:38.920 --> 01:20:40.770
was published in
the journal Science.

01:20:40.770 --> 01:20:44.140
Again, constantly mentioned as
probably the most influential

01:20:44.140 --> 01:20:46.110
science journal in this country.

01:20:46.110 --> 01:20:49.030
And it was published--
what year was it? '88.

01:20:49.030 --> 01:20:51.390
'88, '92, '90?

01:20:51.390 --> 01:20:51.890
OK.

01:20:51.890 --> 01:20:53.100
I'm getting the year wrong.

01:20:53.100 --> 01:20:57.000
But it was just before the
Clinton election against Bush

01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:00.180
where one of the big issues
was gays in the military.

01:21:00.180 --> 01:21:02.550
That was the first thing
that Clinton turned to

01:21:02.550 --> 01:21:03.820
after he was elected.

01:21:03.820 --> 01:21:06.450
I happen to know the man
who is the editor of Science

01:21:06.450 --> 01:21:07.330
at the time.

01:21:07.330 --> 01:21:08.880
And they timed the publication.

01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:11.570
That paper came out in
late October of that year.

01:21:11.570 --> 01:21:14.270
And they held it for
that time because they

01:21:14.270 --> 01:21:17.830
knew that this was going to be
an issue in the election, which

01:21:17.830 --> 01:21:21.480
was kind of cool that they did
that, although some people may

01:21:21.480 --> 01:21:22.410
disagree.

01:21:22.410 --> 01:21:22.910
OK.

01:21:22.910 --> 01:21:24.040
But we hurtle on.

01:21:24.040 --> 01:21:27.560
So what other biological,
neurobiological differences,

01:21:27.560 --> 01:21:29.780
as a function of
sexual orientation?

01:21:29.780 --> 01:21:32.980
Another one that comes through
over and over and over again,

01:21:32.980 --> 01:21:35.280
which-- what do
you make of this--

01:21:35.280 --> 01:21:38.950
is apparently there is a
reliable gender difference

01:21:38.950 --> 01:21:41.110
in the length of
the second finger

01:21:41.110 --> 01:21:44.150
versus the fourth finger,
the ratio of the two.

01:21:44.150 --> 01:21:47.020
And just to show how bi--
whoa, did a lot of hands

01:21:47.020 --> 01:21:49.300
just go up in this auditorium.

01:21:49.300 --> 01:21:51.690
And just to show how
biologically compelling

01:21:51.690 --> 01:21:54.190
the explanation is for
it, I don't actually

01:21:54.190 --> 01:21:58.250
remember which like-- who's
got the greater four to two

01:21:58.250 --> 01:22:00.620
ratio, which sex, or whatever.

01:22:00.620 --> 01:22:02.900
But it is a very--
now people are

01:22:02.900 --> 01:22:04.840
checking each other's hands.

01:22:04.840 --> 01:22:05.450
OK.

01:22:05.450 --> 01:22:10.200
The first wave of-- and now
all this chimp hand inspection

01:22:10.200 --> 01:22:11.660
stuff happening in here.

01:22:11.660 --> 01:22:15.200
And what has been shown
quite reliably since then is,

01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:18.550
on the average, gay men tend
to have the finger length

01:22:18.550 --> 01:22:22.080
ratio of straight women
rather than of straight men.

01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:23.860
A small effect there.

01:22:23.860 --> 01:22:26.920
Another even more
bizarre finding,

01:22:26.920 --> 01:22:31.720
which is there is something
called the autoacoustic reflex.

01:22:31.720 --> 01:22:35.300
And what that is is if you sit
there and plug your ears up

01:22:35.300 --> 01:22:37.980
with your fingers, you will
hear a noise that is just

01:22:37.980 --> 01:22:40.560
coming from the intrinsic
vibration of something

01:22:40.560 --> 01:22:42.220
right there in your
ears, and that's

01:22:42.220 --> 01:22:45.240
the autoacoustic reflex
generating some low Hertz

01:22:45.240 --> 01:22:46.440
sound in there.

01:22:46.440 --> 01:22:50.950
And the rate of the oscillation
differs by sex in humans,

01:22:50.950 --> 01:22:53.240
which no doubt
explains everything

01:22:53.240 --> 01:22:56.990
about the tragic
wars of the sexes

01:22:56.990 --> 01:22:59.380
and why people just don't
understand each other

01:22:59.380 --> 01:23:02.490
by gender because of their ears
vibrating at different speeds.

01:23:02.490 --> 01:23:04.260
But what these studies
have also shown

01:23:04.260 --> 01:23:07.700
was gay men having the
autoacoustic reflexive

01:23:07.700 --> 01:23:10.850
vibratory speed more
typical of straight women

01:23:10.850 --> 01:23:11.710
than straight men.

01:23:11.710 --> 01:23:13.710
Again, a very small effect.

01:23:13.710 --> 01:23:15.490
What are all of these about?

01:23:15.490 --> 01:23:17.480
The assumptions
are it's got to do

01:23:17.480 --> 01:23:20.980
with something with prenatal
hormone environment.

01:23:20.980 --> 01:23:21.750
Stay tuned.

01:23:21.750 --> 01:23:24.070
We will be coming back to this.

01:23:24.070 --> 01:23:26.120
Now somewhere in
there you may ask, OK,

01:23:26.120 --> 01:23:29.490
well what about the neurobiology
of sexual orientation in women?

01:23:29.490 --> 01:23:31.660
Vastly smaller literature.

01:23:31.660 --> 01:23:33.460
Far, far less studied.

01:23:33.460 --> 01:23:36.780
What has been shown so far
are only two endpoints.

01:23:36.780 --> 01:23:40.820
One is the same deal with the
fourth to second finger ratio.

01:23:40.820 --> 01:23:44.980
On the average, gay women
have the ratio more typical

01:23:44.980 --> 01:23:46.615
of straight men
than straight women.

01:23:46.615 --> 01:23:47.990
The other thing
that's been shown

01:23:47.990 --> 01:23:52.050
is the same autoacoustic
reflex thingy going on there.

01:23:52.050 --> 01:23:54.890
Final realm of
neurobiology, rather than

01:23:54.890 --> 01:23:57.950
issues of gay versus
straight, what

01:23:57.950 --> 01:24:01.000
is the neurobiology
of transsexuality?

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:04.020
And that used to be
considered to be purely

01:24:04.020 --> 01:24:06.660
a domain of psychopathology.

01:24:06.660 --> 01:24:10.660
If being gay used to be
a certifiable psychiatric

01:24:10.660 --> 01:24:14.450
disorder-- up until the early
1970s, the American Psychiatric

01:24:14.450 --> 01:24:17.200
Association in their textbook,
the Diagnostic Statistical

01:24:17.200 --> 01:24:21.090
Manual, you could be
psychiatrically certified

01:24:21.090 --> 01:24:21.620
as ill.

01:24:21.620 --> 01:24:25.710
A psychiatric disorder was
being homosexual or lesbian.

01:24:25.710 --> 01:24:28.370
And then in what had to
have been one of the more

01:24:28.370 --> 01:24:31.310
all-time blow out
committee meetings ever,

01:24:31.310 --> 01:24:33.510
they decided that,
no, actually it's

01:24:33.510 --> 01:24:34.780
not a psychiatric disorder.

01:24:34.780 --> 01:24:37.100
And overnight, about
40 million Americans

01:24:37.100 --> 01:24:39.330
were cured of a
psychiatric disease.

01:24:39.330 --> 01:24:43.410
The notion of transsexuality
as a psychiatric disorder

01:24:43.410 --> 01:24:46.320
has had much, much
longer shelf life.

01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:49.020
What's the neurobiology of that?

01:24:49.020 --> 01:24:52.350
To date, there have been
a handful of studies,

01:24:52.350 --> 01:24:55.490
and they show essentially
the same thing-- really,

01:24:55.490 --> 01:24:56.900
really interesting.

01:24:56.900 --> 01:24:59.310
Another region of
the brain that shows

01:24:59.310 --> 01:25:01.340
a sex difference in
its average size--

01:25:01.340 --> 01:25:03.580
don't even worry about
the name of this.

01:25:03.580 --> 01:25:06.790
It's called the bed nucleus
of the stria terminalis.

01:25:06.790 --> 01:25:09.950
It's where the amygdala
begins to send its projection

01:25:09.950 --> 01:25:11.370
into the hypothalamus.

01:25:11.370 --> 01:25:13.820
Another one to those
gender differences.

01:25:13.820 --> 01:25:16.320
There is one type
of neuron in there

01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:20.190
with a certain type of
neurotransmitter, where very,

01:25:20.190 --> 01:25:23.690
very reliably it is about
twice the size in males

01:25:23.690 --> 01:25:24.790
than in females.

01:25:24.790 --> 01:25:26.870
Sufficiently so that
even in human brains,

01:25:26.870 --> 01:25:29.800
you could pretty confidently
determine the sex of somebody

01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:31.550
by seeing the number
of these neurons.

01:25:31.550 --> 01:25:33.030
You'll see, I'm not
even saying the name

01:25:33.030 --> 01:25:34.030
of the neurotransmitter.

01:25:34.030 --> 01:25:34.710
It's irrelevant.

01:25:34.710 --> 01:25:37.050
It's just another one
of those differences,

01:25:37.050 --> 01:25:40.850
a dimorphism in a region of
the brain, a really, really

01:25:40.850 --> 01:25:42.490
reliable one.

01:25:42.490 --> 01:25:47.140
And this was a study done by
some superb neuroanatomists

01:25:47.140 --> 01:25:49.980
looking at transsexuals.

01:25:49.980 --> 01:25:52.680
And what they showed
was very interesting,

01:25:52.680 --> 01:25:57.900
which was very, very reliably
and a very powerful effect.

01:25:57.900 --> 01:26:00.540
What you would see
in their large sample

01:26:00.540 --> 01:26:03.500
size of transsexuals
brains post-mortem

01:26:03.500 --> 01:26:07.760
was people would have this
part of the brain, the size not

01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:12.150
of their sex that they were
born with, but rather of the sex

01:26:12.150 --> 01:26:16.280
they insisted they
always actually were.

01:26:16.280 --> 01:26:17.520
Wow.

01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:19.921
Immediate questions
one must ask.

01:26:19.921 --> 01:26:20.420
OK.

01:26:20.420 --> 01:26:22.330
Well, maybe this
is due to the fact

01:26:22.330 --> 01:26:26.450
that when people change
gender, transsexual procedures,

01:26:26.450 --> 01:26:29.610
there's a whole lot
of hormones involved.

01:26:29.610 --> 01:26:32.510
And maybe that's doing something
to this part of the brain.

01:26:32.510 --> 01:26:35.130
Critical control
that they had was

01:26:35.130 --> 01:26:37.250
this was looking
both at transsexuals

01:26:37.250 --> 01:26:41.210
who had made gender changes and
those who went to their death

01:26:41.210 --> 01:26:44.130
bed saying this is
not the sex that I am,

01:26:44.130 --> 01:26:47.340
I got the wrong body, but
never made the change.

01:26:47.340 --> 01:26:49.270
It wasn't a function
of having actually

01:26:49.270 --> 01:26:52.730
gone through the transition
and the endocrine manipulations

01:26:52.730 --> 01:26:53.470
with it.

01:26:53.470 --> 01:26:56.230
Another control
they had, which was

01:26:56.230 --> 01:26:59.020
looking at men who would get
a certain type of testicular

01:26:59.020 --> 01:27:00.820
cancer where they
would have to be

01:27:00.820 --> 01:27:03.252
treated with certain
feminizing hormones.

01:27:03.252 --> 01:27:05.460
In other words, very similar
to some of the endocrine

01:27:05.460 --> 01:27:08.970
treatments of male-to-female
transgendered individuals.

01:27:08.970 --> 01:27:12.120
And post-mortem, you didn't
see the changes there.

01:27:12.120 --> 01:27:14.350
It has nothing to do
with the hormones.

01:27:14.350 --> 01:27:18.650
It had to do with the person
insisting from day one

01:27:18.650 --> 01:27:20.880
that they got the wrong body.

01:27:20.880 --> 01:27:23.930
And this was a landmark
study, fabulously

01:27:23.930 --> 01:27:26.730
well done and controlled,
and replicated once

01:27:26.730 --> 01:27:30.000
since then showing that
what transsexualism used

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.180
to be thought of
is that people who

01:27:32.180 --> 01:27:35.380
think that they're a different
gender than they actually are.

01:27:35.380 --> 01:27:38.750
What this study suggests is
what transsexualism is about

01:27:38.750 --> 01:27:42.300
is people who got the
wrong gendered body.

01:27:42.300 --> 01:27:47.800
And these are people who are
chromosomally of one sex.

01:27:47.800 --> 01:27:50.110
In terms of their gonads,
they're of that sex.

01:27:50.110 --> 01:27:52.400
In terms of their hormones,
they're of that sex.

01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:55.310
In terms of their genitalia
and their secondary sexual

01:27:55.310 --> 01:27:57.650
characteristics,
they are of that sex.

01:27:57.650 --> 01:28:01.100
But they're insisting,
that's not who I really am.

01:28:01.100 --> 01:28:04.220
This part of the brain
agrees with them.

01:28:04.220 --> 01:28:06.560
Also very interestingly
that study

01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:10.360
was done by the same Dutch
scientists who did this one.

01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:13.790
Again, this is very
complex terrain

01:28:13.790 --> 01:28:16.930
in terms of what these
things wind up implicating.

01:28:16.930 --> 01:28:20.240
Interestingly, that study was
published right around the time

01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:23.750
that the city of San Francisco
did something very cool, which

01:28:23.750 --> 01:28:26.970
was for city employees
now, medical insurance

01:28:26.970 --> 01:28:29.350
will cover transgender
operations.

01:28:29.350 --> 01:28:32.150
However, there is no evidence
that the obscure endocrine

01:28:32.150 --> 01:28:34.520
journal published out
of Latvia or something

01:28:34.520 --> 01:28:37.840
did that like the afternoon
before the San Francisco

01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:39.930
commissioners had their
meeting on that one.

01:28:39.930 --> 01:28:42.280
But nonetheless,
this is a subject

01:28:42.280 --> 01:28:44.550
with all sorts of
realms of implications.

01:28:44.550 --> 01:28:48.120
One additional study
about transsexualism.

01:28:48.120 --> 01:28:48.730
OK.

01:28:48.730 --> 01:28:52.040
How many of you know about
Phantom Limb Syndrome?

01:28:52.040 --> 01:28:53.150
OK.

01:28:53.150 --> 01:28:57.600
You are a guy with a penis,
and you get a certain type

01:28:57.600 --> 01:28:58.730
of penile cancer.

01:28:58.730 --> 01:29:02.270
And what's often done is
your penis is excised.

01:29:02.270 --> 01:29:03.400
It is cut off.

01:29:03.400 --> 01:29:06.460
And about 60% of men who have
had to have their penises

01:29:06.460 --> 01:29:08.730
removed because of
cancer there wind up

01:29:08.730 --> 01:29:14.890
getting phantom penile
sensations, which

01:29:14.890 --> 01:29:17.180
I don't want to know about.

01:29:17.180 --> 01:29:21.500
What you see though is when you
take transgendered individuals

01:29:21.500 --> 01:29:24.340
who go from male to
female, in other words,

01:29:24.340 --> 01:29:28.160
as part of it having
their penises removed, 0%

01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:30.970
rate of penile
phantom sensation.

01:29:30.970 --> 01:29:34.660
Suggestion being that there
is something much more

01:29:34.660 --> 01:29:38.050
"normal" in that case than
when a penis is being removed

01:29:38.050 --> 01:29:43.630
for cancer, a whole new area
of research, very novel,

01:29:43.630 --> 01:29:44.780
very challenging.

01:29:44.780 --> 01:29:45.390
OK.

01:29:45.390 --> 01:29:48.410
So this has giving us a
sense now of this bucket.

01:29:48.410 --> 01:29:52.400
And we are now ready to move
on to, what in the environment

01:29:52.400 --> 01:29:54.700
releases some of
these fixed action

01:29:54.700 --> 01:29:56.210
patterns of sexual behavior?

01:29:56.210 --> 01:29:58.740
What in the environment
is doing this or that

01:29:58.740 --> 01:30:02.080
to the medial preoptic
area or the amygdala

01:30:02.080 --> 01:30:04.950
or vasopressin receptor
levels or any such thing.

01:30:04.950 --> 01:30:08.750
What are the sensory
triggers for the neurobiology

01:30:08.750 --> 01:30:10.290
of sexual behavior?

01:30:10.290 --> 01:30:10.990
OK.

01:30:10.990 --> 01:30:15.690
Right off, what is obvious is
we are in ethologyville here.

01:30:15.690 --> 01:30:19.170
It's going to depend on the
species which sensory modality

01:30:19.170 --> 01:30:20.375
is most important.

01:30:20.375 --> 01:30:24.180
And this is, once again, the
crushing of the limbic system

01:30:24.180 --> 01:30:26.340
equals nose-brain concept.

01:30:26.340 --> 01:30:29.040
Limbic system equals
nose-brain if you are a rat.

01:30:29.040 --> 01:30:30.850
It's, once again, going
to be interviewing

01:30:30.850 --> 01:30:33.410
an animal in its own language.

01:30:33.410 --> 01:30:35.990
You've got species where
the releasing stimuli

01:30:35.990 --> 01:30:37.460
are all visual.

01:30:37.460 --> 01:30:39.530
And we've heard one
example of that already,

01:30:39.530 --> 01:30:42.550
which were the pathetic male
turkeys getting faked out

01:30:42.550 --> 01:30:46.120
by the Styrofoam female turkeys
with the feathers pointing

01:30:46.120 --> 01:30:47.070
the wrong way.

01:30:47.070 --> 01:30:48.730
Visual stimuli.

01:30:48.730 --> 01:30:52.110
Other species are
quite visual as well.

01:30:52.110 --> 01:30:56.440
Primates, non-human primates,
monkeys, for example.

01:30:56.440 --> 01:31:00.031
And what studies have shown
is-- how's this for remarkable?

01:31:00.031 --> 01:31:00.530
OK.

01:31:00.530 --> 01:31:04.370
Here we have-- nah, forget it.

01:31:04.370 --> 01:31:05.040
OK.

01:31:05.040 --> 01:31:07.490
You will take a rhesus
monkey, a rhesus monkey

01:31:07.490 --> 01:31:08.660
from a social group.

01:31:08.660 --> 01:31:11.250
And he's sitting there,
and he can lever press

01:31:11.250 --> 01:31:12.470
for various rewards.

01:31:12.470 --> 01:31:15.120
And he will press a lever
a certain number of times

01:31:15.120 --> 01:31:19.180
to get some juice as a reward.

01:31:19.180 --> 01:31:21.670
He will press a lever a
certain number of times

01:31:21.670 --> 01:31:24.970
to see a high ranking male
from his social group,

01:31:24.970 --> 01:31:26.860
no doubt to keep
an eye on the guy.

01:31:26.860 --> 01:31:30.000
He will not lever press
to see a male who is lower

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:33.340
ranking than him, but
he will lever the most

01:31:33.340 --> 01:31:38.590
to see pictures of female
rhesus monkeys who are in heat.

01:31:38.590 --> 01:31:39.680
Whoa!

01:31:39.680 --> 01:31:41.360
Is that weird or what?

01:31:41.360 --> 01:31:44.340
And the bigger the estrus
swelling on the female,

01:31:44.340 --> 01:31:45.990
the more levered
pressing the male

01:31:45.990 --> 01:31:49.690
will do to be able to see this.

01:31:49.690 --> 01:31:50.960
So that's kind of interesting.

01:31:50.960 --> 01:31:54.180
And this close relative of ours,
in terms of visual stimuli.

01:31:54.180 --> 01:31:56.840
What is also known
is humans are highly

01:31:56.840 --> 01:31:59.850
visual in their sexual
responsiveness as well.

01:31:59.850 --> 01:32:02.570
Visual stimuli as
releasing stimuli.

01:32:02.570 --> 01:32:06.550
What is no surprise
whatsoever is on the average,

01:32:06.550 --> 01:32:09.870
males are more responsive
to visual releasing stimuli

01:32:09.870 --> 01:32:11.850
than are females among humans.

01:32:11.850 --> 01:32:14.650
And this has been
shown in various ways.

01:32:14.650 --> 01:32:18.750
For example, now studies using
brain imaging showing that

01:32:18.750 --> 01:32:23.720
for visually sexually arousing
material that not only

01:32:23.720 --> 01:32:27.640
are men on the average
subjectively more responsive,

01:32:27.640 --> 01:32:29.190
but you get more
of an activation

01:32:29.190 --> 01:32:33.200
of the dopamine pathways
in men than in women.

01:32:33.200 --> 01:32:36.250
What's interesting also
is that in men, you

01:32:36.250 --> 01:32:40.690
uniquely get activation of that
area of the amygdala as well.

01:32:40.690 --> 01:32:43.920
And again, that weird world
of the structure of the brain

01:32:43.920 --> 01:32:47.690
heavily involved in aggression
also being involved something

01:32:47.690 --> 01:32:50.490
about male sexual motivation.

01:32:50.490 --> 01:32:51.620
What else?

01:32:51.620 --> 01:32:54.820
Then there, of course, is the
world of tactile stimulation.

01:32:54.820 --> 01:32:58.790
And what you've got is a whole
domain where, not surprisingly,

01:32:58.790 --> 01:33:01.670
stimulate the right
tactile receptors,

01:33:01.670 --> 01:33:03.920
and it is sexually arousing.

01:33:03.920 --> 01:33:04.810
Are they sure?

01:33:04.810 --> 01:33:06.520
Have they done enough
research on this?

01:33:06.520 --> 01:33:08.730
And you will activate
dopamine regions.

01:33:08.730 --> 01:33:10.830
All of that making
perfect sense.

01:33:10.830 --> 01:33:15.500
What also makes perfect sense is
some types of tactile receptors

01:33:15.500 --> 01:33:18.700
in some part of the body
activate dopamine more

01:33:18.700 --> 01:33:20.500
than other types.

01:33:20.500 --> 01:33:23.580
We are now in the whole
world of erogenous zones

01:33:23.580 --> 01:33:25.070
and that whole deal.

01:33:25.070 --> 01:33:28.630
What is also clear is
that these receptors,

01:33:28.630 --> 01:33:32.680
these tactile receptors, their
responsiveness to stimuli

01:33:32.680 --> 01:33:36.150
will change depending
on your hormone levels.

01:33:36.150 --> 01:33:40.180
And what you see is in women,
tactile responsiveness,

01:33:40.180 --> 01:33:43.780
the extent to which
tactile stimulation of skin

01:33:43.780 --> 01:33:46.870
throughout the body, but
especially of the genitals,

01:33:46.870 --> 01:33:50.730
tactile stimulation evokes
more dopamine activation

01:33:50.730 --> 01:33:52.650
when somebody is ovulating.

01:33:52.650 --> 01:33:56.180
In other words, at
ovulation, women's skin

01:33:56.180 --> 01:33:59.620
is more sensitive to
sexually arousing touch.

01:33:59.620 --> 01:34:02.520
In men, it requires
testosterone.

01:34:02.520 --> 01:34:07.220
Men who are castrated, tactile
responsiveness to stimuli

01:34:07.220 --> 01:34:09.910
goes down in terms of
finding them pleasurable,

01:34:09.910 --> 01:34:11.320
sexually arousing.

01:34:11.320 --> 01:34:14.680
Final domain of tactile
stuff, the specialized version

01:34:14.680 --> 01:34:18.250
we've heard of already, that
lordosis reflex business.

01:34:18.250 --> 01:34:21.460
Again, that's a spinal
reflex, but this is not

01:34:21.460 --> 01:34:23.820
a spinal reflex of bopping
somebody on the knee

01:34:23.820 --> 01:34:25.480
and their leg goes flying out.

01:34:25.480 --> 01:34:27.960
This is spinal
reflex where you only

01:34:27.960 --> 01:34:31.970
get the lordotic arch backing
in females-- arch backing?

01:34:31.970 --> 01:34:33.410
Back arching.

01:34:33.410 --> 01:34:34.424
OK.

01:34:34.424 --> 01:34:36.090
You don't get either,
but you especially

01:34:36.090 --> 01:34:38.320
don't get the arch
backing when you don't

01:34:38.320 --> 01:34:40.140
have elevated estrogen levels.

01:34:40.140 --> 01:34:44.840
Only when females are ovulating
are those tactile receptors

01:34:44.840 --> 01:34:48.620
sensitive to pressure on
the flanks of the rear end,

01:34:48.620 --> 01:34:50.500
and out comes the reflex there.

01:34:50.500 --> 01:34:52.480
So tactile stimulation.

01:34:52.480 --> 01:34:54.840
At the end of the day,
though, without question,

01:34:54.840 --> 01:34:57.360
as agreed upon by every
scientist on earth,

01:34:57.360 --> 01:35:02.100
the coolest sensory modality
for sexual release stimuli

01:35:02.100 --> 01:35:05.710
are olfactory cues, pheromones.

01:35:05.710 --> 01:35:08.840
And thus, we enter the
magnificent wonderful world

01:35:08.840 --> 01:35:13.140
of pheromonal communication
and pheromonal sexual arousal.

01:35:13.140 --> 01:35:16.540
All sorts of interesting
findings there.

01:35:16.540 --> 01:35:20.140
First, at the end of
generating pheromones

01:35:20.140 --> 01:35:21.740
that are sexually arousing.

01:35:21.740 --> 01:35:26.200
What is required in both
species-- in both species?

01:35:26.200 --> 01:35:26.800
Whoa.

01:35:26.800 --> 01:35:28.240
That was an interesting slip.

01:35:28.240 --> 01:35:32.690
What's required in
both sexes-- OK.

01:35:32.690 --> 01:35:40.610
What's required in both kinds
is the right hormones into order

01:35:40.610 --> 01:35:42.510
to generate pheromones.

01:35:42.510 --> 01:35:45.444
Sexually arousing pheromones
in all the different species

01:35:45.444 --> 01:35:47.110
look-- that's where
the species part was

01:35:47.110 --> 01:35:48.490
coming into that sentence.

01:35:48.490 --> 01:35:52.900
What you see is males do not
generate sexually arousing

01:35:52.900 --> 01:35:56.010
pheromones if they lack
testosterone levels.

01:35:56.010 --> 01:35:59.930
Ovariectomized females,
women, rats, monkeys,

01:35:59.930 --> 01:36:02.460
et cetera, who have had
their ovaries removed

01:36:02.460 --> 01:36:06.560
do not produce pheromones
that are sexually arousing.

01:36:06.560 --> 01:36:08.460
What that of course
brings up is,

01:36:08.460 --> 01:36:12.950
what are some of the chemical
constituents of pheromones?

01:36:12.950 --> 01:36:15.810
And this is very interesting
because it brings up

01:36:15.810 --> 01:36:19.150
another one of those weird
domains of neuromarketing,

01:36:19.150 --> 01:36:22.440
pheromones that have
sexually arousing components.

01:36:22.440 --> 01:36:25.530
There's all sorts of fatty
acids that play a role in that.

01:36:25.530 --> 01:36:28.300
But a lot of what is sexually
arousing about pheromones

01:36:28.300 --> 01:36:31.330
in different species
are breakdown products

01:36:31.330 --> 01:36:33.010
of sex hormones.

01:36:33.010 --> 01:36:36.770
Breakdown products of
androgens in males,

01:36:36.770 --> 01:36:39.130
of estrogens in females.

01:36:39.130 --> 01:36:42.340
And that winds of providing
some of these sexually

01:36:42.340 --> 01:36:45.600
arousing aspects of those odors.

01:36:45.600 --> 01:36:47.860
What does that
immediately tell you?

01:36:47.860 --> 01:36:51.590
Your olfactory receptors have
all sorts of receptors there

01:36:51.590 --> 01:36:54.650
that could pick up on remnants
of testosterone and estrogen,

01:36:54.650 --> 01:36:55.930
things of that sort.

01:36:55.930 --> 01:36:58.140
That makes a lot of sense.

01:36:58.140 --> 01:37:00.010
What doesn't make
any sense at all

01:37:00.010 --> 01:37:04.430
is the following finding,
which is perfume.

01:37:04.430 --> 01:37:07.860
Perfume, in its classic
form, is made out

01:37:07.860 --> 01:37:11.510
of the sweat of various animals.

01:37:11.510 --> 01:37:12.880
OK.

01:37:12.880 --> 01:37:16.680
Except we're going to get into
even worse domain here, which

01:37:16.680 --> 01:37:19.080
is perfumes
traditionally, before

01:37:19.080 --> 01:37:21.390
getting the synthetic
versions, were typically

01:37:21.390 --> 01:37:26.461
made from the sweat
of male animals.

01:37:26.461 --> 01:37:26.960
Hm.

01:37:26.960 --> 01:37:28.310
What's that about?

01:37:28.310 --> 01:37:29.450
Musk.

01:37:29.450 --> 01:37:30.860
Things of that sort.

01:37:30.860 --> 01:37:32.020
Chanel No.

01:37:32.020 --> 01:37:37.380
5 is made from the sweat of
whipped male Abyssinian cats.

01:37:37.380 --> 01:37:38.370
I kid you not.

01:37:38.370 --> 01:37:41.650
And this even produced
protests some years ago,

01:37:41.650 --> 01:37:44.160
animal rights groups,
about how we should not

01:37:44.160 --> 01:37:46.000
be perfuming ourselves
with the sweat

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.550
of whipped male Abyssinian cats.

01:37:48.550 --> 01:37:51.600
Suddenly, you've
got a real puzzle.

01:37:51.600 --> 01:37:55.210
Along comes synthetic perfumes,
and the majority of them

01:37:55.210 --> 01:37:58.520
are made of synthetic
versions of androgens.

01:37:58.520 --> 01:37:59.810
Wait a second.

01:37:59.810 --> 01:38:03.530
Perfume is made up of all
sorts of breakdown products

01:38:03.530 --> 01:38:05.450
of male sweat.

01:38:05.450 --> 01:38:09.830
Isn't perfume supposed to
like smell good to guys?

01:38:09.830 --> 01:38:13.080
We have a deep
abiding puzzle here.

01:38:13.080 --> 01:38:14.720
And there is an answer for it.

01:38:14.720 --> 01:38:16.590
Let me survey people first off.

01:38:16.590 --> 01:38:17.170
OK.

01:38:17.170 --> 01:38:19.070
Guys in the room,
how many of you

01:38:19.070 --> 01:38:21.280
basically think that
most perfumes smell

01:38:21.280 --> 01:38:22.150
kind of appealing?

01:38:25.240 --> 01:38:26.710
OK.

01:38:26.710 --> 01:38:29.560
How many of you don't?

01:38:29.560 --> 01:38:30.060
OK.

01:38:30.060 --> 01:38:32.960
Females, how many of you think
your basic off-the-rack perfume

01:38:32.960 --> 01:38:33.792
smells appealing?

01:38:37.411 --> 01:38:37.910
OK.

01:38:37.910 --> 01:38:39.190
Well, that proves something.

01:38:39.190 --> 01:38:39.700
OK.

01:38:39.700 --> 01:38:42.290
Just complete it, how
many of you don't?

01:38:42.290 --> 01:38:42.830
OK.

01:38:42.830 --> 01:38:47.000
The vast majority of perfumes
are not purchased by men.

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.260
The vast majority are
purchased by women.

01:38:49.260 --> 01:38:52.390
In other words, most of
the marketing decisions

01:38:52.390 --> 01:38:54.660
about what to stick
in your perfumes

01:38:54.660 --> 01:38:56.380
are being marketed
for people who

01:38:56.380 --> 01:38:58.450
are going to decide if
it's appealing or not,

01:38:58.450 --> 01:39:01.210
people who have lots of
estrogen in their bloodstream

01:39:01.210 --> 01:39:02.320
rather than androgens.

01:39:02.320 --> 01:39:05.480
That is thought to be
the explanation for how

01:39:05.480 --> 01:39:09.150
it is that most perfumes are
derived from male pheromones.

01:39:09.150 --> 01:39:10.020
Yeah.

01:39:10.020 --> 01:39:13.271
The other thing is if
I were to wear perfume

01:39:13.271 --> 01:39:15.520
it would more so that girls
think I smell good instead

01:39:15.520 --> 01:39:16.680
of for me to think I smell god.

01:39:16.680 --> 01:39:17.255
OK.

01:39:17.255 --> 01:39:17.754
Yes.

01:39:20.420 --> 01:39:23.030
The strategizing starts.

01:39:23.030 --> 01:39:23.530
OK.

01:39:23.530 --> 01:39:26.720
So a whole new world of
potential neuromarketing here.

01:39:26.720 --> 01:39:30.450
But this taps into, what are
the chemical constituents

01:39:30.450 --> 01:39:31.610
of pheromones?

01:39:31.610 --> 01:39:33.540
What sort of
information is carried

01:39:33.540 --> 01:39:37.370
by pheromones, olfactory
communication, between genders?

01:39:37.370 --> 01:39:40.410
It will tell you the
species of the individual.

01:39:40.410 --> 01:39:42.090
It will tell you their gender.

01:39:42.090 --> 01:39:45.700
It will tell you whether
they are gonadally intact,

01:39:45.700 --> 01:39:47.590
whether they've been
castrated or not.

01:39:47.590 --> 01:39:49.520
It will tell you something
about their health.

01:39:49.520 --> 01:39:52.290
It will tell you whether
they are terrified or not.

01:39:52.290 --> 01:39:55.450
Have the sweat from someone or
something that is terrified,

01:39:55.450 --> 01:39:57.920
and as we already know,
it will smell differently

01:39:57.920 --> 01:39:58.830
to the amygdala.

01:39:58.830 --> 01:40:02.310
It will have a lot more
glucocorticoid breakdown

01:40:02.310 --> 01:40:03.360
products in it.

01:40:03.360 --> 01:40:05.530
And it will tell you,
as we know already,

01:40:05.530 --> 01:40:09.580
if it's the right species, if
this person is related to you.

01:40:09.580 --> 01:40:12.780
Final point before we then
go into the specifics of what

01:40:12.780 --> 01:40:16.410
pheromones are doing to the
neurobiology of all this,

01:40:16.410 --> 01:40:20.170
finally, not only do you need
to have hormones intact in order

01:40:20.170 --> 01:40:22.450
to generate the
pheromones, you need

01:40:22.450 --> 01:40:25.160
to have the right
reproductive hormones on board

01:40:25.160 --> 01:40:27.320
in order to perceive them.

01:40:27.320 --> 01:40:30.620
Men who are castrated
no longer find

01:40:30.620 --> 01:40:35.390
the smells of
female ovarian-- OK,

01:40:35.390 --> 01:40:36.791
I'm getting ahead
of myself here.

01:40:36.791 --> 01:40:37.290
OK.

01:40:37.290 --> 01:40:38.956
If you don't have the
hormones on board,

01:40:38.956 --> 01:40:41.120
if you have no estrogen
and you're female,

01:40:41.120 --> 01:40:43.340
or if you have no
testosterone and you are male,

01:40:43.340 --> 01:40:45.510
you will not be
able to distinguish

01:40:45.510 --> 01:40:47.960
the sweat of women and men.

01:40:47.960 --> 01:40:51.980
Gonadally intact people can
at above the chance level.

01:40:51.980 --> 01:40:56.120
Finally, women become
far better at detecting

01:40:56.120 --> 01:40:59.800
the smell of-- distinguishing
the smell of men versus women

01:40:59.800 --> 01:41:01.840
when they are ovulating.

01:41:01.840 --> 01:41:04.810
Finally, finally,
that's not what you see

01:41:04.810 --> 01:41:06.900
when you have gay individuals.

01:41:06.900 --> 01:41:10.540
Gay men are better at
detecting the smell of gay men

01:41:10.540 --> 01:41:13.240
than either straight
men or straight women.

01:41:13.240 --> 01:41:14.920
So we've gotten the
first pieces of here

01:41:14.920 --> 01:41:16.490
with the pheromonal system.

01:41:16.490 --> 01:41:19.790
You have to be hormonally
intact to generate

01:41:19.790 --> 01:41:23.970
pheromones that are sexually
informative and to detect them.

01:41:23.970 --> 01:41:27.590
What we will then transition
to is, what sort of information

01:41:27.590 --> 01:41:29.680
is being carried
in the pheromones

01:41:29.680 --> 01:41:32.800
and what effect does it
have on the neurobiology

01:41:32.800 --> 01:41:36.010
of depending on who's
pheromones you are sniffing?

01:41:36.010 --> 01:41:36.510
OK.

01:41:36.510 --> 01:41:38.120
So we will--

01:41:38.120 --> 01:41:41.370

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:05.860
Stanford University.

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.084
Let us get started here.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.680
So picking up from the other
day, where have we gotten?

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.020
Not very far.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.860
Behavior-- full
range variability

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.450
of sexual behaviors,
fixed action patterns.

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:27.730
Is this kind of dark here?

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.350
No.

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:32.460
Seeing in some ways
what's interesting

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.910
is the conservative nature of
sexual behavior across species,

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.130
other ways the sheer
variety, trying

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.850
to make sense of what aspects
of human behavior are unique,

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:43.630
all of that.

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:46.300
Then beginning to march
backwards-- what goes on

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.780
in the nervous system one second
before sexual behavior occurs?

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.850
And marching through the
relevant limbic structures,

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.900
some of which have
strong sex differences,

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.520
some of which don't.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.590
Seeing some ways in
which neurotransmitters

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.980
in the whole world of dopamine
complicates things enormously,

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:07.820
marching through there.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.220
Where we had then gotten
to was asking, OK, so

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.270
what sort of bits of information
in the environment, what

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.570
sort of ethological
releasing stimuli

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.210
can trigger the nervous
system to do its thing?

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:21.860
And you've got the drill by now.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.540
So what we had done
was look at a couple

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.890
of different sensory
systems, and we had just

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.900
started to wallow in
the world of pheromones,

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.900
of pheromonal communication.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.630
What we ended with was number
one, the hormone dependency

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.440
of generating sexually
meaningful pheromones,

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.860
that business being
that males have to have

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.110
sufficient testosterone.

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.430
Females have to have
ovaries on board

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.190
to be producing pheromones
that carry sexual meaning.

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.110
What is the reason for that?

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.950
The fact that a whole lot
of the actual chemicals that

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.540
constitute sexually meaningful
pheromones are made out

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.280
of some sex hormone
breakdown products

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.900
and the sheer bizarrity but
eventual wonderful clarity

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.340
of what's up with perfumes.

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.509
Then transitioning
at the very end

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.640
to the business about how your
endocrine status has a lot

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.820
to do with your perception of
pheromones from the other sex,

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.840
that women who are
ovariectomized to low estrogen

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.330
levels have trouble being
able to differentiate

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.780
the smell of males and
females, men and women.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.230
And estrogen replacement
takes care of that.

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.150
The exact same thing when you
take away testosterone for men,

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.810
and what we were just about to
get to before we had to stop

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.180
was one additional
thing, which is

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.610
one's opinion about
the pheromones

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.130
that you were smelling.

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.830
And this goes back
to a literature,

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.180
a really interesting
one showing that

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.440
not only are women
better at differentiating

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.260
between the smell
of men and women--

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.790
gonadally intact men and women.

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.310
Not only are they
better at doing

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.460
that around the
point of ovulation,

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.950
but their preference
for the smell of males

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.020
gets more dramatic around
the time of ovulation.

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.490
Meanwhile, over at the
male end of things,

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:14.340
something rather
similar in terms of what

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.610
you make of the pheromones.

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:21.210
And this was a famous classic
study in which women volunteers

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:23.840
had their armpits swabbed
at different points

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.730
in their menstrual cycle and
put into little sealed jars,

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.530
and all sorts of male
volunteers sniffing them

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.880
and rating their pleasantness.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.420
And what you found
was on the average,

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.220
the odorants were rated in
the unpleasant direction,

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.270
but they were rated as least
unpleasant around the time

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:44.750
that women are ovulating.

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.960
And I think once we get
past the world of armpit

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:51.060
smells in little
glass jars, one can

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.460
get into the more ethologically
relevant world of men prefer

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:57.840
pheromones derived from
women around the time

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.290
when women are ovulating.

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.450
Once again, a
testosterone-dependent

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.030
phenomenon.

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.520
What we now begin
to look at are some

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:10.560
of the physiological effects of
sexual pheromones between sexes

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.740
within sexes.

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:14.790
One example you heard about
in the very first lecture,

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.730
which is that whole business,
that Wellesley effect

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:20.680
the ability of females of all
sorts of different species,

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.180
including college
freshman human females,

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.980
to synchronize each
other's cycles,

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:29.770
this being done with pheromones,
intersexual perception

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.040
of pheromones, so
the Wellesley effect.

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.220
What's also shown in a
number of rodent species

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.020
is the pheromones, the
smell of an adult female,

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:44.380
will delay the onset of
puberty of younger females.

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.220
And how might one frame that?

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.960
That is utterly a gene
competition sort of strategy

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:50.510
there.

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:52.740
This is reproductive
competition.

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.890
If you arrest the development
of the other females around you,

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:00.290
you are going to leave
more copies, et cetera.

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:03.290
Meanwhile, a
literature of intramale

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:05.730
physiological
effects-- what happens

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:08.360
to the physiology of
males in various species

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.340
when smelling the
pheromones of other males?

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.670
What you see, first
off, is it depends

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:17.470
on who the other guy you're
smelling, the dominance rank.

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:21.050
In lots of rodent species and
some primate species as well,

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.860
males are able to
differentiate between smells

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.416
of very high ranking males
and very low ranking ones,

00:05:26.416 --> 00:05:27.290
and what do you know?

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:29.750
They're not all that upset
about the low ranking ones.

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.020
What do you see in terms of
the physiological effects

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:34.900
in the number of
species when males

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.610
are smelling the pheromones
of big, healthy, strapping,

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.420
androgenic other males?

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:44.310
In some cases, it drives down
their testosterone levels.

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:47.660
They're totally
physiologically intimidated,

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:50.440
this being some great
competitive strategy

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:52.650
for males who could pump
out just the right kind

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:54.300
of suppressive pheromones.

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.430
In other species,
though, what you

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:59.610
see is a sudden burst
of sperm production,

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:01.140
and what's that about?

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:03.410
Another version of
the same logic-- this

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:05.240
is a counter-strategy.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:09.160
If males have come up, evolved
the means in various rodent

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:13.390
species to generate pheromones
that will drive down

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:16.370
testosterone levels in
opponents, what males also

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:19.770
want to have evolve with some
mechanism of when smelling

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:22.370
those sorts of pheromones
to try to counter that

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:25.740
by increasing sperm production.

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:30.030
What we have here is a
co-evolutionary arms race.

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:34.549
Terms of interactions of
pheromones between the sexes,

00:06:34.549 --> 00:06:36.340
and what I've been
doing here is describing

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:38.530
all this without
making use of this,

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:40.910
so what you see
is physiologically

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:43.740
when the female is
the pheromone donor,

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:46.580
and the other recipient is
a female in terms of, say,

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:49.960
puberty, decreasing
puberty onset,

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:53.420
and what we just saw with
male is donor versus male

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:56.830
is in some ways suppressing
some endpoint's testosterone,

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:59.820
in some ways increasing
sperm production.

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:02.220
What you see in lots
of rodent species,

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:05.990
when you're looking at
between genders, when males

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:08.660
are the source of
pheromones among rodents,

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:14.030
it accelerates puberty
onset in the females.

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:17.360
And when you've got
females as the donors,

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:21.090
it increases testosterone
level and sperm production

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:23.550
in the males of lots
of different species.

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:26.160
So all this makes
wonderful, wonderful, sort

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:29.560
of sociobiological sense in
terms of how this should work.

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:31.910
Elaborations on this, of course.

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:35.240
What you also see is
not only puberty onset

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:36.580
and being regulated.

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:38.970
You also see in all
sorts of species

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:43.780
where you can induce
ovulation by sensory stimuli.

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:47.770
What you see is the
smell of a female

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:52.030
will decrease the likelihood
of induced ovulation.

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:55.200
Female-- the smell of
a male will increase

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:56.490
the likelihood of ovulation.

00:07:56.490 --> 00:07:58.890
All sorts of species
that do not have

00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:02.250
automatic rhythms of
ovulation cycles of that way,

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:04.060
but rather they are induced.

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:07.510
And one classic example
of that are pigs.

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:10.760
Pigs are inducible ovulators,
if you've always wondered

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:12.330
whether that's the case or not.

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:15.820
And you can go and
recreationally buy

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:18.140
a variant of pig pheromone.

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:20.900
This is known as Boar
Mate, and no doubt,

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:23.076
that's not only patent
pended, but somewhere out

00:08:23.076 --> 00:08:24.450
in the Midwest,
there's all sorts

00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:27.010
of TV jingles about Boar Mate.

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:34.370
And Boar Mate is an ovulation
inducer in female boars

00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:37.929
and involving a same
male-derived pheromone,

00:08:37.929 --> 00:08:41.350
which are found in truffles,
truffles which somehow

00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:45.480
have stumbled on the means to
induce female pigs to ovulate.

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:49.060
And no doubt, that's explaining
some very interesting

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:53.330
interspecies interactions,
so that being another realm.

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:56.020
Inducible all
physiological changes--

00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:59.160
in this case, one classic
demonstration of it.

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:02.650
In this case,
probably pheromones

00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:06.690
of female causing an indirect
measure of testosterone levels

00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:07.540
in a male.

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:10.030
This is a classic
paper, and you will

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:12.600
note that I didn't
say females and males.

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:14.660
Saying a female and a male.

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:18.370
This was a classic paper in
nature some 30 years ago or so,

00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:22.030
which was written by the very
famous and well-known doctor

00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:23.200
Anonymous.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:26.040
The author's name was
not published there.

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:30.050
And this was a researcher
who did research

00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:33.830
in an unspecified hemisphere
with an unspecified species,

00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:37.410
but involved long stretches of
being at a research facility

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:40.480
completely on his own in
isolation from other humans,

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:42.820
and all sorts of people in
the business for decades

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:45.310
afterward have been speculating
on who the author is.

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:47.660
And it's generally understood.

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:50.610
And what this person noted
was every now and then,

00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:53.550
he would pick up and
go to the city that

00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:56.970
was a three-hour
seaplane flight away

00:09:56.970 --> 00:09:59.200
or some such thing,
where among other things,

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:03.040
he had a highly significant
other with a great deal

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:06.336
of physical intimacy
and all that stuff

00:10:06.336 --> 00:10:08.400
from kind of the right
side of the chart.

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:11.110
And what he noticed
was what he perceived

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:13.650
to be an extraordinary
difference in what he

00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:18.940
was subjectively interpreting
as testosterone-driven mood

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:22.550
and level of energy and all of
that depending on where he was.

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:24.930
Not quite being the
type of field ethologist

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:27.350
that took blood from
himself, what he did instead

00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:30.590
was take an indirect assay
building on the well-known fact

00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:32.140
that testosterone
has something to do

00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:34.760
with the rate of beard growth.

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:37.610
And what he wound up
doing was very soon,

00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:40.680
having a razor there
every day, shaving,

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:43.990
and getting the little bits
of stubble, and weighing it.

00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:47.000
Weighing it is an indirect
assay of testosterone levels,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.330
and what was shown was
sit out there by himself

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:52.365
with whatever ungulates
he was obsessing over,

00:10:52.365 --> 00:10:53.990
and this sort of rate
of beard growth--

00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:57.270
go back to the rest of the
world, and it does this.

00:10:57.270 --> 00:10:59.760
And this square wave
going on like that,

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:03.810
this as a very-- and OK, what
are all the confounds here?

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:05.620
It's not clear if
it was pheromones.

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:07.490
Maybe it was actually
being in proximity

00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:09.770
to the newspaper
in the town that he

00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:11.240
returned to now and then.

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:12.950
Maybe there was a
confound of whatever

00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:15.690
aftershave he was using
that was doing something

00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:16.700
rather to his testes.

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:18.660
Nonetheless,
generally interpreted

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:21.510
as this being a really
interesting, indirect,

00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:24.920
and equal-- was one
example of induction

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:27.880
of physiological
changes in human males

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:30.600
by pheromones from females.

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:33.450
So if you ever meet Dr.
Anonymous, who interestingly,

00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:35.850
has been publishing
papers for about 300 years

00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:39.310
or so every now and then,
congratulate that individual

00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:41.280
on the research.

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:44.600
So pheromonal stuff--
now elaborations of it,

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:47.230
which you should be able
to derive all on your own

00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:49.710
from some of our
principles by now, which

00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:54.780
is, what if for example,
you are a female donor

00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:57.200
and female recipient,
and the whole logic

00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:00.720
here being decrease the
likelihood of ovulation?

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.620
Delay the onset of puberty.

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:06.490
What if these are siblings,
if these are two sisters?

00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:08.670
And you were off and
running with that one.

00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:10.830
It will not work as effectively.

00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:12.940
Easy kin selection argument.

00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:15.450
So all sorts of
aspects of relatedness,

00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:18.160
you will not have your
testosterone levels driven up

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:21.520
if you are a hamster, and you
were smelling your sister,

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:25.870
all that sort of thing that
makes perfect sense by now.

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:30.350
Now switching over-- one last
piece of business, though.

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:33.590
In terms of the pheromonal
attractiveness stuff,

00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:38.150
a handful of studies showing
that among homosexual men, what

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:42.770
you have is it's the smell of
men who are preferred to women,

00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:45.020
and it's when men have
higher testosterone

00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:48.500
levels that they are preferred.

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:52.670
And what we've got there
is an exact same physiology

00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:56.300
in a somewhat going in the
opposite direction, flipping

00:12:56.300 --> 00:13:00.230
of things that sure argues for
some interesting biological

00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:01.220
underpinnings.

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:07.800
One final thing-- women not only
prefer the smell of men when

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:09.880
around the time that
they are ovulating.

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:13.420
Their noses selectively
become more sensitive to such

00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:17.560
smells, and estrogen has
all sorts of receptors

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:19.900
on olfactory neurons.

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:21.680
So that makes sense.

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:24.370
Leaping over to other
sensory systems--

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:26.650
gustatory stimuli--
this is not one

00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:29.200
of the more exciting outposts,
unless you are something

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:32.360
like a giraffe, in which case
you take part in what is called

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:37.990
flehmening, a good old Germanic
ethological term, which is you

00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:40.730
want all sorts of interesting
reproductive information

00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:43.170
on somebody else,
and you just don't

00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:45.700
have the time to sniff
the air for pheromones.

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:48.580
So what you do is you go over
and lick the individual's

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:51.740
private parts, and suddenly,
you know oh so much

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:53.310
about their personal lives.

00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:56.160
In this case, gustatory
information being passed.

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.130
We've already heard
about examples

00:13:58.130 --> 00:14:02.050
of auditory priming,
inducible ovulation

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:06.990
in various moose-like species
in the wilds of Minnesota,

00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:10.670
where what the stags have
these roaring fixed action

00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:15.840
patterns, which will induce all
sorts of ovulatory responses

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:17.530
in females around.

00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:19.270
So this is another domain.

00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:21.440
Remember also that
interesting factoid

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:23.560
when this was
mentioned previously

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:26.460
that in human
females, voices get

00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:29.690
a little bit higher around
the time of ovulation

00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:31.530
and in a way that is detectable.

00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:34.810
Something important in terms
of all this pheromonal stuff

00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:36.870
in humans, what
has been shown over

00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:41.650
and over and over again is these
are all subliminal processes as

00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:45.680
in the humans are not
consciously aware of wow,

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:49.580
this one smells more like my
gonadally intact second cousin

00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:53.250
who was adopted away to Bolivia
for awhile when I was a kid.

00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:55.880
There is not the consciousness,
but nonetheless, you

00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:57.830
force people to
make these choices,

00:14:57.830 --> 00:15:00.840
and implicitly, you get
insight into these same sort

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:02.560
of influences.

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:06.920
But, of course, by the
time you get to humans,

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:09.880
and you talk about sensory
releasers and all of that,

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:14.080
you get, of course, the point
endlessly emphasized by Cosmo

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:17.820
and God knows where else that
ultimately, the most erogenous

00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:21.570
organ in humans is the
brain, thought as a releaser,

00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:24.910
thought as a more powerful
humans are not a particularly

00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:26.560
olfactory species.

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:29.110
We are not a particularly
great auditory one,

00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:30.410
et cetera, et cetera.

00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:33.780
An awful lot of these
sexual priming in humans

00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:36.840
coming by way of
thought bypassing

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:39.670
this whole ethological world.

00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:43.600
More environmental factors,
acute environmental factors

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:46.840
that can affect all of
this, and what you've got

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:49.350
is a very reliable
way to drive down

00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:52.100
libido is to make an
organism terrified.

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:56.180
Fear as suppressive of
reproductive behavior.

00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:59.840
What you also have is
extreme rage doing the same.

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:02.810
Stress in general--
stress is interesting,

00:16:02.810 --> 00:16:05.380
because what you get is
a dichotomous outcome,

00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:07.040
chronic stress.

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:09.550
So now we're not talking
about an acute stressor,

00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:11.460
but all the way
back, chronic stress

00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:15.190
is extremely suppressive
of reproductive physiology

00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:17.290
and behavior, which
you will be finding out

00:16:17.290 --> 00:16:20.010
when you read the relevant
chapter in the zebra's book.

00:16:20.010 --> 00:16:23.820
But what you see as short term,
there's a lot more variability,

00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:25.740
particularly among males.

00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:28.550
What you see is a
lot of variability

00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:34.210
as to whether short term stress
stimulates arousal or inhibits

00:16:34.210 --> 00:16:34.960
it.

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:37.360
And people have
pointed out all sorts

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:40.010
of horrific bits
of evidence showing

00:16:40.010 --> 00:16:43.120
in circumstances of
extreme arousal and stress,

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:47.250
say, during warfare, where
that produces all sorts

00:16:47.250 --> 00:16:50.040
of violent sexual behavior.

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:53.400
No shortage of horrible
historical precedents

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:54.550
for those.

00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:57.320
So a difference between
chronic stress versus acute

00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:59.860
stress-- more
effects around here.

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:05.440
One final interesting bit of
releasing stimulus, stimuli,

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:08.359
whatever a bit of a
stimulus is, and one

00:17:08.359 --> 00:17:10.930
that transcends a
particular sensory system

00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:13.619
is something called
the Coolidge effect.

00:17:13.619 --> 00:17:15.819
And the Coolidge effect
probably accounts

00:17:15.819 --> 00:17:19.359
for like 49% of the
misery encapsulated

00:17:19.359 --> 00:17:22.130
in human literature and
movies and all of that.

00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:24.800
What is the Coolidge
effect in species

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:26.609
after species after species?

00:17:26.609 --> 00:17:30.070
You take an individual,
who is sexually sated,

00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:32.270
which is to say that,
for example, you've

00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:35.160
got some male rodent who's been
mating with the female rodent

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:38.630
there, and has gotten to the
point where he has had enough,

00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:41.270
enough on some
physiological level

00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:44.760
or some deeply emotional
what matters to me in my life

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:46.300
rodential sort of level.

00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:48.830
But in any case,
the male is sated,

00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:51.430
has stopped having
sex with a female.

00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:53.190
And what the Coolidge
effect is about

00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:56.950
is he put in a different
female, and things

00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:58.610
start all over again.

00:17:58.610 --> 00:18:03.444
Variety as wildly stimulating
of sexual arousal,

00:18:03.444 --> 00:18:07.220
and the Coolidge effect sure
works in humans and accounts

00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:08.580
for all sorts of misery.

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:10.460
Coolidge, by the way,
was not the scientist

00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:12.530
who first described
it, but Coolidge

00:18:12.530 --> 00:18:15.730
refers to Calvin Coolidge,
and as far as I know,

00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:18.020
this is the only
anecdote ever to occur

00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:20.760
about the guy, something
where he and his wife

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:23.000
were being shown
some chicken farm,

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.090
and there were
breeding roosters.

00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:30.740
And when they would get sick
of breeding with this pen,

00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:32.120
they would stick a new one in.

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:35.610
And Mrs. Coolidge made
some sarcastic remark,

00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:38.210
and he made one back,
and before you knew it,

00:18:38.210 --> 00:18:39.630
it was the Great Depression.

00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:43.600
So I actually have no
memory of what they said,

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:46.020
but in terms of
wittiness, you get

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:48.890
what you can when you
have Calvin Coolidge, so.

00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:49.470
OK.

00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:50.970
We hurtle on.

00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:54.770
We hurtle on here, now beginning
to look at an entire missing

00:18:54.770 --> 00:18:56.650
category here in my rush.

00:18:56.650 --> 00:18:58.960
Now we have what's
going on with hormones,

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:01.160
longer term hormonal stuff?

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:04.790
Not the hormone levels
that you have influenced

00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:09.100
as a result of sexual behavior,
not the hormone levels just

00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:11.880
right around the time
of all this neurobiology

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:16.100
happening, but now beginning
to talk about hormone levels

00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:20.360
like over the last 28
days or so in a female.

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:22.670
And what one
immediately barrels into

00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:27.080
is this issue of how much
is sexual behavior in women

00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:30.310
a function of where
you are in your cycle?

00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:32.030
What's the reason
even to suspect

00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:36.740
that the entire world of other
species that will have females

00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:39.430
coming into estrus,
coming into heat,

00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:41.650
having elevated
estrogen levels only

00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:45.390
at very demarcated times of
the year, and what you see

00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:48.690
is in lots of species,
a large number of them,

00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:52.870
in fact-- what you see is you
only get reproductive behavior,

00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:56.430
you only get sexual behavior
in females around the time

00:19:56.430 --> 00:19:57.820
that they are ovulating.

00:19:57.820 --> 00:20:02.900
You only get active female
proceptive seeking of sex

00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:04.530
around those times.

00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:06.930
By the time you get
to non-human primates,

00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:09.610
it depends on the species
you're looking at.

00:20:09.610 --> 00:20:13.040
But in general, it's not quite
as tight of a relationship.

00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:19.230
So if you had some
rodent across a year,

00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:21.500
this was all the
points of ovulation.

00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:24.120
Your pattern of sexual
behavior of a female

00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:25.990
would look like this.

00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:28.530
Likelihood of mating
with a male by the time

00:20:28.530 --> 00:20:31.580
you get to non-human
primates in most species,

00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:32.730
it looks more like that.

00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:35.970
It's not quite as dramatic, and
thus, of course, the question

00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:39.950
becomes, where do
humans fit in on this?

00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:44.040
And a classic study, extremely
influential in the early '70s

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:48.290
was the first to look at this,
which was females, humans,

00:20:48.290 --> 00:20:51.570
women reporting their
levels of sexual activity,

00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:54.110
as well as the
likelihood of orgasm

00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:58.740
per sexual bout, if
that's the right word,

00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:01.440
and where they
were in the cycle.

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:03.220
So this is what you
wound up seeing,

00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:07.680
and this by any measure,
likelihood of having sex,

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:10.660
whatever, the curve looked
something like this.

00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:19.290
And what they reported
was a big increase

00:21:19.290 --> 00:21:24.170
around the time of day 14 and
a secondary increase around day

00:21:24.170 --> 00:21:25.140
28.

00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:26.590
Not as large of
one, and when you

00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:28.610
looked at the
likelihood of orgasm,

00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:31.470
it was basically doing
the same exact thing.

00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:35.930
Day 14-- that's just a somewhat
less restricted version

00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:37.620
of the exact same phenomenon.

00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:40.650
Never down to zero,
but nonetheless,

00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:43.700
this is another version of
this exact same phenomenon--

00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:48.360
libido sexual proceptivity
increasing in women,

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:51.840
in human females around
the time of ovulation.

00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:56.510
But no other species shows
this one going on here, so

00:21:56.510 --> 00:21:57.480
what's up with that?

00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:00.070
Any speculation why you
have the secondary increase

00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:00.986
around day 28?

00:22:06.610 --> 00:22:07.110
Come on.

00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:11.830
Somebody's got to--
yes, you're right.

00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:13.420
That's exactly what they found.

00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:15.570
That's exactly what they
found, and good for you

00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:17.500
feeling comfortable
speaking up in class

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:18.800
all in unison like that.

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:19.300
OK.

00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:23.140
What that tends to be
is that women are more

00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:26.270
relaxed about fear of
pregnancy around the time

00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:30.010
of their period, and, thus,
sexual behavior increases

00:22:30.010 --> 00:22:31.430
somewhat around that point.

00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:34.200
But the thing that everybody
most importantly came away with

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:37.900
was just like every
other mammal out there

00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:41.470
that has regular cycling
or only seasonal ones,

00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:45.360
high estrogen is when you
get the most sexual behavior.

00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:48.200
Instead of high estrogen
is the only time

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:49.650
you get sexual behavior.

00:22:49.650 --> 00:22:52.510
Instead, you simply get
the most around then.

00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:54.830
In the years since,
lots of people

00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:57.000
have done versions
on this study,

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.390
and it is frequently difficult
to replicate this phenomenon

00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:04.820
in terms of a change in
levels of sexual activity

00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:07.510
in women around the
time of ovulation.

00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:09.900
What has remained very
clear in the literature

00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:13.770
though is that sexual arousal
increases around the time

00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:15.030
of ovulation in women.

00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:18.250
Very reliable effect.

00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:21.830
And what that is
interpreted as is behavior

00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:23.940
here may not be
telling you anywhere

00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:28.450
near as much as motivation,
arousal, proceptivity

00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:31.150
at that time, and that's
a more pure measure

00:23:31.150 --> 00:23:33.100
of what's going on
physiologically there

00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:34.940
or what's going
on in the brains.

00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:38.520
Fitting with that is a
very interesting literature

00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:41.830
suggesting that women act
a little bit differently

00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:44.520
in terms of proceptive
sexual signaling

00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:46.460
around the time of ovulation.

00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:51.070
Studies showing, for example,
that women as assessed

00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:54.210
by both women and men,
women on the average

00:23:54.210 --> 00:23:56.980
wear more provocative
clothing around the time

00:23:56.980 --> 00:23:58.440
that they are ovulating.

00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:01.710
Yes, people would go and study
things like this for a living.

00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:06.750
These were not big effects,
but the all-time bizarre study

00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:08.410
I've ever heard
of in this domain

00:24:08.410 --> 00:24:11.330
was actually published with
a straight face by this guy,

00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:14.380
and he's an evolutionary
psychologist, University

00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:16.720
of New Mexico, a guy
named Jeffrey Miller, who

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:18.240
reported the following.

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:21.150
And you know what he
was spending his time

00:24:21.150 --> 00:24:23.990
doing, which he
reported was that

00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:29.015
around the time of ovulation,
lap dancers get larger tips.

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:34.740
OK.

00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:39.960
That has since been
replicated in E. coli

00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:44.710
and in various yeast
species, and you know,

00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:47.840
I'm not going to try to unpack
that one in any sort of way.

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:50.110
But nonetheless,
this was reported

00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:53.260
and shows you just how wonderful
it could be to be a scientist.

00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:55.820
Can you imagine
that money was being

00:24:55.820 --> 00:24:58.190
spent on that-- your
research dollars-- instead

00:24:58.190 --> 00:25:02.240
of strafing people in Kandahar
province or something?

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:05.360
So we have a peak there,
this general issue

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:09.520
of what does hormonal
cyclicity, in a time scale

00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:10.680
of weeks to months.

00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:13.830
What does that do to sexual
behavior in various species?

00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:17.180
What does that do to sexual
arousal proceptivity?

00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:19.870
What are some of the
building blocks of that?

00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:22.430
Estrogen-- as
estrogen levels go up,

00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:25.370
estrogen increases
the expression

00:25:25.370 --> 00:25:29.250
of receptors for progesterone.

00:25:29.250 --> 00:25:32.510
So you can immediately
begin to piece that apart

00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:36.190
in at least two different
ways, first one being estrogen,

00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:39.130
thus increasing the
sensitivity in the brain.

00:25:39.130 --> 00:25:40.240
This is a brain effect.

00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:42.020
Sensitivity to
progesterone, which

00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:46.660
has something to do with the
rewarding aspects of sex.

00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:50.130
You can also translate that
into molecular biology.

00:25:50.130 --> 00:25:52.870
Estrogen, being a
steroid hormone,

00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:56.660
is going to bind to its receptor
and do the whole transcription

00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:58.920
factor, translocation
sort of thing,

00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:01.650
telling you that
upstream of the gene

00:26:01.650 --> 00:26:05.230
for the progesterone
receptor is a promoter that's

00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:08.370
responsive to estrogen
and estrogen receptors.

00:26:08.370 --> 00:26:11.030
You know how this
one works by now.

00:26:11.030 --> 00:26:14.340
More pieces of it--
estrogen when rising here,

00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:18.090
also increases the
synthesis of oxytocin.

00:26:18.090 --> 00:26:20.860
Back to all that
social bonding stuff,

00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:24.490
and what that suggests-- I don't
know if it has been studied,

00:26:24.490 --> 00:26:29.210
but that women will feel
more affiliative with someone

00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:32.170
they've had sex with if
around the time of ovulation

00:26:32.170 --> 00:26:33.260
than at other points.

00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:35.650
That is certainly
the case with a vole,

00:26:35.650 --> 00:26:38.360
but that is certainly
the case, because they

00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:42.830
don't mate the rest of the time,
and because male voles suddenly

00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:45.960
are expressive around there
in terms of their feelings.

00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:49.760
OK So more building
blocks of it.

00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:52.340
Estrogen is not only having
effects in the brain,

00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:54.470
but it's also having
effects throughout the body

00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:58.040
at those times in terms
of lowering the threshold

00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:00.730
of certain tactile receptors.

00:27:00.730 --> 00:27:02.070
What does that mean?

00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:04.010
That means around
the time that women

00:27:04.010 --> 00:27:06.610
are ovulating,
thanks to estrogen,

00:27:06.610 --> 00:27:08.830
they are more
sensitive to touch.

00:27:08.830 --> 00:27:12.380
And I'm sure this has been
studied in consenting hamsters,

00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:15.050
but my bet is that more
sensitive to tactile

00:27:15.050 --> 00:27:18.240
stimulation in some parts
of the body over others.

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:21.990
What estrogen also is
doing, as we just heard,

00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:23.715
is working on the
olfactory system

00:27:23.715 --> 00:27:27.800
and lowering thresholds for
detecting the smell of males.

00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:30.940
So we've got all sorts
of ways within the brain

00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:34.890
and in the periphery to
bias towards more arousal

00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:35.680
at that time.

00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:38.050
Wonderful evolutionary biology.

00:27:38.050 --> 00:27:39.630
No problem at all.

00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:42.110
One additional piece
of the female story,

00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:45.370
which is the effects over the
course of this kind of time

00:27:45.370 --> 00:27:48.890
span-- weeks to months to
years or so-- the effects

00:27:48.890 --> 00:27:52.180
of those androgens,
those male sex hormones

00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:53.960
that females are releasing.

00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:55.720
And what you see
there is that plays

00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:59.700
a role in proceptivity,
increasing sexual arousal,

00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:02.070
sexual motivation.

00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:05.610
Meanwhile, on the other side
of the road, we've got males,

00:28:05.610 --> 00:28:08.960
and what does testosterone--
testosterone over

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:11.280
this time span-- what
does it have to do

00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:13.830
with sexual behavior in males?

00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:16.860
Well, on first pass,
it sure looks like it

00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:19.170
has a lot to do with it.

00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:20.970
What sort of evidence?

00:28:20.970 --> 00:28:23.890
Initially, correlative evidence.

00:28:23.890 --> 00:28:28.410
Well, the time of year
in various species

00:28:28.410 --> 00:28:31.320
where males do their
mating is the time of year

00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:34.140
when testosterone
levels are elevated.

00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:36.790
Over the life span,
testosterone levels

00:28:36.790 --> 00:28:39.530
go up around puberty
and from about age

00:28:39.530 --> 00:28:44.040
30 on, very gently cascade
down into alarming senescence,

00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:47.170
and what you see there is
a similar profile in terms

00:28:47.170 --> 00:28:48.660
of sexual behavior.

00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:50.410
That does not tell us much.

00:28:50.410 --> 00:28:51.970
These are correlations.

00:28:51.970 --> 00:28:55.250
Furthermore, correlative
studies in humans, a handful,

00:28:55.250 --> 00:28:58.240
showing more sexually
active men tend

00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:00.400
to have higher
testosterone levels,

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:02.500
and for what it's worth,
a number of studies

00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:05.980
have documented a dramatic
drop in testosterone levels

00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:10.390
in men right around the time
that they become fathers.

00:29:10.390 --> 00:29:10.890
OK.

00:29:10.890 --> 00:29:12.110
So figure that one out.

00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:15.470
Also an increase in vasopressin
levels at that time.

00:29:15.470 --> 00:29:18.660
You know how to interpret
this one by now.

00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:21.880
So we've got testosterone
and higher levels

00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:25.040
of male sexual behavior
going hand in hand.

00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:28.000
Are we looking at
any causality here?

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.870
First off, we already know
about one piece of causality,

00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:35.980
which was the other day, sexual
behavior in men, in males,

00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:38.110
increases testosterone levels.

00:29:38.110 --> 00:29:41.080
So that's one reason why
they may go hand in hand.

00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:42.790
In that scenario,
testosterone has

00:29:42.790 --> 00:29:47.270
nothing to do with increasing
the likelihood of the behavior.

00:29:47.270 --> 00:29:49.320
So does testosterone
actually have

00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:52.700
a causal role in
increasing the likelihood

00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:54.660
of male sexual behavior?

00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:57.050
And the answer is yes.

00:29:57.050 --> 00:29:58.210
And how do you show it?

00:29:58.210 --> 00:30:00.950
With the most simple classic
way of doing something

00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:03.780
in an endocrine study,
which is get rid

00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:05.710
of the guy's testosterone.

00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:08.730
And you castrate the
male, your rodent male,

00:30:08.730 --> 00:30:10.780
your non-human
primate male, and what

00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:16.080
you see is there is a big drop
in levels of sexual behavior.

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:20.640
And this could range from male
lever pressing to get access

00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:23.560
to a female to
courtship displays

00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:27.170
to extent of pomading
of hair or something

00:30:27.170 --> 00:30:30.180
in the right neighborhoods,
and whatever the measure is,

00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:33.390
this is when normal testosterone
levels are on board.

00:30:33.390 --> 00:30:39.030
And this is after castration,
a very, very dramatic drop.

00:30:39.030 --> 00:30:43.200
Now to fulfill the second
ironclad requirement

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:46.050
in endocrinology, the last
thing you need to do now

00:30:46.050 --> 00:30:50.340
is after the
subtraction experiment,

00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:52.310
to do a replacement one.

00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:55.180
Artificially give
back the normal levels

00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:58.430
to the castrated individual,
and levels of sexual behavior

00:30:58.430 --> 00:30:59.800
go back to there.

00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:00.521
Whoa.

00:31:00.521 --> 00:31:01.020
OK.

00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:05.180
That proves that we have a
causal relationship here.

00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:06.970
Not so fast.

00:31:06.970 --> 00:31:11.830
First thing to note, which
is 0% testosterone and sexual

00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:13.860
behavior goes way, way down.

00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:15.610
It doesn't go to zero.

00:31:15.610 --> 00:31:18.190
In every species
looked at, starting

00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:21.420
with the embarrassing sexual
behavior of everyone's pet dogs

00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:24.750
when they were six years old,
even after being neutered, what

00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:28.680
you see is there's a level
of residual sexual behavior--

00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:32.230
rodents, dogs, primates,
including humans.

00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:34.140
This is a critical point.

00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:37.480
How much residual
sexual behavior

00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:39.630
is there after castration?

00:31:39.630 --> 00:31:43.740
The more sexual experience
before castration,

00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:47.650
the more there is going
to be retained afterward.

00:31:47.650 --> 00:31:52.380
In other words, on a certain
like totally artificial level,

00:31:52.380 --> 00:31:54.170
this amount of
sexual behavior is

00:31:54.170 --> 00:31:56.150
being driven by testosterone.

00:31:56.150 --> 00:31:58.650
This amount, which
persists here,

00:31:58.650 --> 00:32:00.910
is being driven by
social experience.

00:32:00.910 --> 00:32:03.480
It's got nothing to
do with the hormones.

00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:05.520
Yes, this is ridiculous
dichotomizing

00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:08.500
into this, but the fact
that it doesn't go to zero,

00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:10.700
and the fact that the
more sexual experience

00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:14.240
pre-castration, the more
residual behavior, this

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:16.740
is a vote for just
how much of a role

00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:21.210
social experience, social
conditioning plays.

00:32:21.210 --> 00:32:23.650
Next thing that takes
away from the yes,

00:32:23.650 --> 00:32:25.630
it's all caused
by testosterone--

00:32:25.630 --> 00:32:28.270
now you do an
elaboration on the study.

00:32:28.270 --> 00:32:31.870
You castrate a male,
and now instead

00:32:31.870 --> 00:32:35.040
of replacing with
100% of normal levels,

00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:38.870
you give 10% of
normal levels, or you

00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:41.580
give 200% of normal levels.

00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:43.060
And what do you wind up seeing?

00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:47.070
If testosterone plays a
strictly causative role, even

00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:50.040
in this range, you are
going to get something--

00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:52.050
this is going to
be lower than 100%,

00:32:52.050 --> 00:32:53.530
and this is going to be higher.

00:32:53.530 --> 00:32:56.310
That's not what you see.

00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:59.310
Instead, it is
something like that.

00:32:59.310 --> 00:33:01.770
You get roughly the
same reinstatement

00:33:01.770 --> 00:33:07.300
of sexual behavior when you
return testosterone levels

00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:09.890
over anything
roughly approximating

00:33:09.890 --> 00:33:12.490
the normal physiological range.

00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:14.340
What does that tell you?

00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:18.080
The brain circuits we learned
about the other day involved

00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:22.000
in sexual motivation-- it
requires testosterone around

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.610
to work fully, not
entirely, but to work fully.

00:33:25.610 --> 00:33:29.300
But those brain
regions are not really

00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:33.290
all that concerned with the
exact level of testosterone.

00:33:33.290 --> 00:33:37.640
Rough approximation of normal,
rough approximation of normal

00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:39.600
has the exact same effect.

00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:42.220
If you were seeing
a tight relationship

00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:45.920
in a male between the
amount of sexual behavior

00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:48.030
and testosterone
levels, it's not

00:33:48.030 --> 00:33:51.540
because every little smidgen
bit of more testosterone

00:33:51.540 --> 00:33:54.270
is going to drive
more sexual behavior.

00:33:54.270 --> 00:33:57.490
It's because every little
additional smidgen of behavior

00:33:57.490 --> 00:34:00.500
is going to drive higher
testosterone levels.

00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:03.240
So we've got this really
important observation.

00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:07.110
Yes, testosterone is needed
in species after species,

00:34:07.110 --> 00:34:11.290
including humans, for the
normal range of sexual behavior.

00:34:11.290 --> 00:34:15.699
Just as importantly, castration
never drops it down to zero.

00:34:15.699 --> 00:34:18.570
The more social experience,
that whole song and dance,

00:34:18.570 --> 00:34:21.880
and very importantly
as well, the system

00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:24.960
is not sensitive to
little differences

00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:26.580
in testosterone levels.

00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:29.530
Stating that a different
way, if some guy has

00:34:29.530 --> 00:34:32.330
one and 1/2 percent
more testosterone

00:34:32.330 --> 00:34:34.860
on board than the guy
sitting next to him

00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:37.940
or than he had last week,
is that going to mean he

00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:41.270
is going to be more sexually
motivated, more aroused?

00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:42.670
No, not at all.

00:34:42.670 --> 00:34:46.620
Within the normal range, the
system doesn't distinguish it.

00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:49.870
The relevant brain regions
are sensitive to testosterone

00:34:49.870 --> 00:34:54.090
and require it, but do not care
a whole lot about the levels.

00:34:54.090 --> 00:34:57.240
One exception, which is
if you instead of, say,

00:34:57.240 --> 00:35:02.210
200%, push testosterone
levels like 1000%,

00:35:02.210 --> 00:35:07.270
tenfold higher than normal,
this is supraphysiological,

00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:09.670
which means it's out of
the normal range, which

00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:12.810
means no bodies normally
generate those sorts of levels.

00:35:12.810 --> 00:35:15.910
Put it up in that range,
and you will get an increase

00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:18.820
in sexual behavior
and sexual arousal.

00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:20.650
When do you see this?

00:35:20.650 --> 00:35:24.300
The idiots who go and
abuse anabolic steroids

00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:27.400
for their weight lifting or
whatever, people doing that

00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:29.920
are not pushing up their
testosterone levels

00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:34.140
into the higher range of what
human bodies can generate.

00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:37.280
They are pushing it way
above the normal range.

00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:40.850
In that range, you
do see an increase

00:35:40.850 --> 00:35:43.600
in sexual proceptivity.

00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:48.450
In a week or so, what we will
see is the exact same story.

00:35:48.450 --> 00:35:51.170
It will be the exact
same chart here when

00:35:51.170 --> 00:35:53.330
asking the question,
what does testosterone

00:35:53.330 --> 00:35:55.030
have to do with aggression?

00:35:55.030 --> 00:35:58.230
And what you'll see is the
exact same conclusions.

00:35:58.230 --> 00:36:00.400
What are we beginning
to see here?

00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:05.040
That testosterone is not playing
a strictly causative role.

00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:07.140
It is playing one
of the words that

00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:10.420
should be becoming repetitive
here and clearly really

00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:11.140
important.

00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:15.120
Testosterone is playing
a modulatory role.

00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:18.730
What testosterone
does is sensitize you

00:36:18.730 --> 00:36:24.320
towards stimuli that are
evocative of sexual arousal.

00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:27.340
It lowers the
threshold, and that

00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:29.410
could be shown in
all sorts of studies,

00:36:29.410 --> 00:36:33.670
but where it's most clear
cut is in this case.

00:36:33.670 --> 00:36:36.730
Does testosterone cause
this sexual behavior?

00:36:36.730 --> 00:36:40.690
No, but when it is on
board, it facilitates it.

00:36:40.690 --> 00:36:42.270
It modulates it.

00:36:42.270 --> 00:36:44.570
Theme again and again and again.

00:36:44.570 --> 00:36:48.400
And that, obviously, has tons to
do with individual differences.

00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:52.720
One last hormone to mention in
this realm of hormone levels

00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:55.000
over the last couple of
weeks, months, seasons,

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.420
or so-- the hormone melatonin.

00:36:57.420 --> 00:36:59.640
And I think that's the
only time melatonin is

00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:01.090
going to be mentioned in class.

00:37:01.090 --> 00:37:04.800
Melatonin has something to do
with telling the body what time

00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:06.036
of year it is.

00:37:06.036 --> 00:37:10.400
It is responsive to the amount
of light you are exposed to.

00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:12.140
What is melatonin about?

00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:15.510
It is one of the driving
forces on seasonal mating.

00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:19.500
Those species where you
suddenly get on one afternoon

00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:22.650
each year, all the wildebeests
ovulate the same afternoon

00:37:22.650 --> 00:37:25.030
kind of thing-- it
is almost certainly

00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:28.700
a whole pathway in the brain
sensitive to the amount

00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:32.440
of light and the amount of
light per day over recent weeks,

00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:34.640
which by way of
melatonin, triggers

00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:36.850
the onset of the mating season.

00:37:36.850 --> 00:37:39.320
Do humans have a
seasonal mating pattern?

00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:42.420
There's a smidgen
of evidence for it.

00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:45.760
If we've got it, it is
a very, very weak echo

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:49.800
of what you see in
some other species.

00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:53.350
Now we shift over to getting
really way back then.

00:37:53.350 --> 00:37:55.530
Instead of over
your last 28 days

00:37:55.530 --> 00:37:58.290
or over the last three
seasons, now beginning to

00:37:58.290 --> 00:38:01.160
look at perinatal factors.

00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:03.330
Perinatal-- before birth.

00:38:03.330 --> 00:38:05.120
Prenatal-- after birth.

00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:08.030
Postnatal-- very
early development.

00:38:08.030 --> 00:38:11.720
First off, focusing
on early environment,

00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:14.030
environmental factors
having something

00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:16.030
to do with adult
sexual behavior.

00:38:16.030 --> 00:38:18.480
What we can translate
that into is

00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:21.440
ways in which early environment
affects every single one

00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:22.940
of these subsequent ones.

00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:25.080
What does early
environment childhood

00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:28.250
have to do with shaping
of sexual behavior?

00:38:28.250 --> 00:38:32.210
A theme that's also going
to come out in every topic

00:38:32.210 --> 00:38:35.040
we're going to hear of
after this, buzz words that

00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:37.750
should be beginning to be
keeping you awake at night--

00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:41.870
modulatory, contingent,
if then, all that stuff.

00:38:41.870 --> 00:38:43.320
Here is another one.

00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:45.940
Here's another concept
that comes through.

00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:50.870
The evidence shows that there
is very little about early life

00:38:50.870 --> 00:38:55.010
experience, which
influences the quality,

00:38:55.010 --> 00:38:59.400
the way in which an organism
goes about having sex.

00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:01.110
What's another
way of stating it?

00:39:01.110 --> 00:39:04.950
This is a pretty set in stone
bunch of fixed action patterns.

00:39:04.950 --> 00:39:09.720
Early experience is not about
learning how to be sexual.

00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:11.920
Early experience
is about learning

00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:15.810
the appropriate social
contexts for being so.

00:39:15.810 --> 00:39:19.040
And that is shown in
species after species.

00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:21.310
That is what
experience is about.

00:39:21.310 --> 00:39:23.970
Not how to do it,
but when to do it

00:39:23.970 --> 00:39:26.140
and who you should
not in your right mind

00:39:26.140 --> 00:39:29.750
try to do something proceptive
to and things of that sort.

00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:32.069
This is what early
experience is about.

00:39:32.069 --> 00:39:33.610
And what we're going
to see in a week

00:39:33.610 --> 00:39:36.860
is the exact same
boring paragraph.

00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:40.770
Early experience does not teach
organisms how to be aggressive.

00:39:40.770 --> 00:39:43.780
It teaches organisms
the appropriate context

00:39:43.780 --> 00:39:45.910
for being aggressive.

00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:48.930
So what's the sort of evidence
for these early effects?

00:39:48.930 --> 00:39:51.210
One example, the
whole literature

00:39:51.210 --> 00:39:53.790
that emerged that is covered
somewhat in the zebra

00:39:53.790 --> 00:39:57.080
book in another domain, but this
whole literature that emerged

00:39:57.080 --> 00:40:01.500
in the 1950s, work looking
at captive primates, what

00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:04.130
are the consequences
of growing up

00:40:04.130 --> 00:40:06.830
in a certain degree
of social isolation?

00:40:06.830 --> 00:40:09.940
What happens to behavior--
and eventually, people

00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:12.070
studying behavior
and physiology-- what

00:40:12.070 --> 00:40:16.740
happens to behavior in adulthood
if you are a young rhesus

00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:20.880
monkey, who grows up only
with peers and no mother,

00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:23.940
or grows up only with
a mother and no peers,

00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:26.110
or grows up with
Mother being present

00:40:26.110 --> 00:40:29.860
only intermittently, or at
the most extremes, growing up

00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:32.500
with neither mother nor
peers or any other member

00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:33.939
of your species around?

00:40:33.939 --> 00:40:35.730
You will see in the
book a whole discussion

00:40:35.730 --> 00:40:38.060
of the ethics of these
studies, but what

00:40:38.060 --> 00:40:40.520
does your early
social environment

00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:42.960
have to do with things
like sexual behavior?

00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:44.840
And what you see
coming out the end

00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:47.490
is when you looked at
these adult primates,

00:40:47.490 --> 00:40:49.770
since replicated
over and over, they

00:40:49.770 --> 00:40:53.130
go about the sexual behavior
the plain old way that everybody

00:40:53.130 --> 00:40:56.290
else does, but they do
it in totally socially

00:40:56.290 --> 00:40:58.070
inappropriate context.

00:40:58.070 --> 00:41:00.220
And thus, you have
these males who

00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:02.870
were raised in some degree
of isolation early on,

00:41:02.870 --> 00:41:05.330
growing up and carrying
out perfectly normal

00:41:05.330 --> 00:41:09.280
sexual fixed action patterns
on the towel in the room,

00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:13.620
on the bowl of food, on the
who knows what wrong context.

00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:16.920
You have trying to do things
with animals you should not

00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:19.790
go anywhere near in
terms of social dominance

00:41:19.790 --> 00:41:22.260
and such in appropriate context.

00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:26.220
Early experience shaping
not how but when,

00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:29.630
what the if-then clauses are.

00:41:29.630 --> 00:41:34.200
More issues of early experience
shaping adult sexual behavior,

00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:36.290
arousal, proceptivity,
et cetera-- we

00:41:36.290 --> 00:41:38.780
already heard one example
of this with humans.

00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:41.120
That's the whole
kibbutz literature.

00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:43.730
That was that whole
business that if you

00:41:43.730 --> 00:41:48.710
spend lots of intimate time
with somebody before age six,

00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:52.330
what you will do is in some
subliminal imprinting way,

00:41:52.330 --> 00:41:55.100
decide forever after
this individual does not

00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:56.820
feel like a potential mate.

00:41:56.820 --> 00:41:58.960
This individual
feels like a sibling.

00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:02.630
That was the example in the
recognizing relative lecture

00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:04.650
of showing that
hooray, we are such

00:42:04.650 --> 00:42:07.030
a cognitively
sophisticated species.

00:42:07.030 --> 00:42:11.110
We can figure out who's
somebody's fourth cousin three

00:42:11.110 --> 00:42:14.000
steps removed by
thinking, and that's

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:17.240
how we make our mating
decisions, showing instead

00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:20.160
in those studies, there is
this non-conscious level.

00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:24.080
One of the rules that humans
have is lots of exposure

00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:25.910
intimately to somebody
early on in life,

00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:28.710
and you are not going
to be very likely to get

00:42:28.710 --> 00:42:31.640
that proceptive behavior
stuff going on later,

00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:35.210
part of turning them
into a pseudo kin because

00:42:35.210 --> 00:42:37.250
of that early exposure.

00:42:37.250 --> 00:42:39.680
One additional domain
I will touch on here

00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:41.490
in terms of early
experience, which

00:42:41.490 --> 00:42:43.500
is, what does early
experience have

00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:45.990
to do with sexual orientation?

00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:49.180
And depending on which decade
you are asking this question,

00:42:49.180 --> 00:42:51.890
the answer would
range from everything

00:42:51.890 --> 00:42:54.010
to virtually nothing.

00:42:54.010 --> 00:42:58.250
Going back to the virtually
everything time, which

00:42:58.250 --> 00:43:01.560
was dominating sort of the first
half of the 20th century, how

00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:04.130
people thought about the
subject, what you had

00:43:04.130 --> 00:43:08.680
were two broad models for what
sort of early environments

00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:12.980
increase the likelihood of
boys becoming gay as adults.

00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:14.390
And these were the two models.

00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:19.190
The first one was the absence
of a father figure model,

00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:22.210
and this was one
straight out of monkeys

00:43:22.210 --> 00:43:24.500
learning who they should
try to pelvic thrust

00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:25.830
with or some such thing.

00:43:25.830 --> 00:43:30.030
This was the argument that
what do father figures provide?

00:43:30.030 --> 00:43:34.500
Training for appropriate context
for proceptive sexual behavior,

00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:37.940
growing up absent a
father, father figure,

00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:40.950
increasing the
likelihood of being gay.

00:43:40.950 --> 00:43:45.040
The other model was having
this totally pain in the neck

00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:48.480
neurotic screwed up
mother, who, as basically

00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:51.960
said between the lines, makes
you crazy when you grow up,

00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:56.810
and thus you have circa 1950,
psychiatrically certifiable

00:43:56.810 --> 00:44:00.470
disorder of having a
different sexual orientation.

00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:02.980
Obviously, where I'm
going to head right now

00:44:02.980 --> 00:44:06.270
is there has not been a
slightest shred of evidence

00:44:06.270 --> 00:44:09.420
over the years either for
the missing father figure

00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:13.630
model of sexual orientation or
the neurotic mothering style

00:44:13.630 --> 00:44:14.670
model.

00:44:14.670 --> 00:44:16.090
Complete nonsense.

00:44:16.090 --> 00:44:19.940
Nonetheless, dominating thinking
about what was going on there.

00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:20.500
OK.

00:44:20.500 --> 00:44:22.550
So what we are now
ready to shift to

00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:26.230
is what's going on with hormones
around this time period.

00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:31.180
Let's take our five-minute
break, and then we'll resume.

00:44:31.180 --> 00:44:34.760
Looking at what perinatal
hormone levels have

00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:37.080
to do with adult
sexual behavior,

00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:39.030
and you already know the answer.

00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:40.980
You know it in
your hearts by now,

00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:44.800
which is, well, it depends on
what species you're looking at.

00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:47.600
And what we will see is a
very similar thing to the rule

00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:50.720
there, which is in
lots of species,

00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:55.410
rodent species, prenatal or
perinatal hormonal environment

00:44:55.410 --> 00:44:59.160
has everything to do with
adult sexual behavior.

00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:00.900
And by the time
we get to humans,

00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:05.170
what we'll see is maybe kind of
sort of more research needed.

00:45:05.170 --> 00:45:08.060
What we begin with
here, implicit in that,

00:45:08.060 --> 00:45:11.280
is a dichotomy that runs
through all of endocrinology

00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:13.140
when thinking about behavior.

00:45:13.140 --> 00:45:16.340
The effects of hormones
back when you were little,

00:45:16.340 --> 00:45:20.430
jargon in the field, an
organizational effect

00:45:20.430 --> 00:45:21.750
of the hormone.

00:45:21.750 --> 00:45:24.200
And what that is
about is explicitly

00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:26.950
is what are hormones
doing at a time in terms

00:45:26.950 --> 00:45:30.640
of organizing what kind of
brain you're developing there.

00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:33.970
Effects of hormones,
instead, in this range or so,

00:45:33.970 --> 00:45:39.010
what you are talking about is
an activational hormonal effect.

00:45:39.010 --> 00:45:41.700
So this is a very sort
of consistent dichotomy

00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:44.890
that people in the business
use, early, early hormonal

00:45:44.890 --> 00:45:47.460
environments having
organizational effects

00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:49.900
on the nervous system,
hormones forever

00:45:49.900 --> 00:45:52.090
after having
activational effects.

00:45:52.090 --> 00:45:54.780
So what you see is
in rodent species

00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:58.020
that perinatal
hormone exposure has

00:45:58.020 --> 00:46:01.330
massive organizational
effects that dramatically

00:46:01.330 --> 00:46:03.830
influence sexual behavior.

00:46:03.830 --> 00:46:08.290
What you also see is it's not
so dramatic and clear cut.

00:46:08.290 --> 00:46:11.050
A whole literature
initially suggesting that,

00:46:11.050 --> 00:46:14.220
for example, male
rodents, if they are not

00:46:14.220 --> 00:46:16.680
exposed to testosterone,
perinatally,

00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:20.390
will have a different male
rodent sexual orientation later

00:46:20.390 --> 00:46:22.570
on, a dichotomous outcome.

00:46:22.570 --> 00:46:24.800
What a huge literature
now shows is

00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:28.770
something that is evident to
every sort of human sexologist

00:46:28.770 --> 00:46:33.040
for centuries, which is it's
not a dichotomous function.

00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:37.320
It is on a continuum in
terms of sexual orientation,

00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:41.630
and 300 different species
have been documented by now

00:46:41.630 --> 00:46:46.040
to have both heterosexual
and homosexual behavior

00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:49.310
at different times in
naturalistic settings.

00:46:49.310 --> 00:46:53.760
So perinatal hormones
having organizing effects

00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:56.350
on adult sexual
orientation-- what you see

00:46:56.350 --> 00:47:00.000
is these are not all or
none properties at all.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:01.310
What else?

00:47:01.310 --> 00:47:02.040
OK.

00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:05.890
What you see specifically
in non-human primates

00:47:05.890 --> 00:47:08.380
is perinatal period.

00:47:08.380 --> 00:47:13.330
Expose a female monkey fetus
to high testosterone levels,

00:47:13.330 --> 00:47:17.750
and what you will do is
masculinize the brain.

00:47:17.750 --> 00:47:21.620
Masculinize the brain, having,
thus, an organizational effect.

00:47:21.620 --> 00:47:24.600
What does masculinization
then manifest itself

00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:26.440
as in adulthood?

00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:31.000
If nothing else is different,
it has no effects at all.

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:35.990
On the other hand, if you
inject a female monkey who

00:47:35.990 --> 00:47:40.320
is masculinized perinatally, if
you inject her with androgens,

00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:44.790
with testosterone, you get a
wild burst of male fixed action

00:47:44.790 --> 00:47:45.980
patterns.

00:47:45.980 --> 00:47:49.120
In other words, you've
got an if-then clause.

00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:54.536
If and only if there was
prenatal masculinization,

00:47:54.536 --> 00:47:59.280
then testosterone will have
an acute activational effect

00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:02.660
on sexual behavior.

00:48:02.660 --> 00:48:04.623
Translating this.

00:48:15.541 --> 00:48:16.040
OK.

00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:18.640
So in the absence in a
normal female monkey,

00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:21.800
in the absence of prenatal
androgens or adult androgen

00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:24.930
levels, this is the amount
of male fixed action

00:48:24.930 --> 00:48:26.480
pattern sexual behavior.

00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:32.270
Now prenatal androgenization--
normal low action levels

00:48:32.270 --> 00:48:34.530
in adulthood.

00:48:34.530 --> 00:48:35.980
Same low levels.

00:48:35.980 --> 00:48:40.460
Now no prenatal androgenization,
and exposure to androgens

00:48:40.460 --> 00:48:42.460
in adulthood-- same low levels.

00:48:42.460 --> 00:48:45.980
Prenatal exposure and
acute activational effects,

00:48:45.980 --> 00:48:49.850
and suddenly, you get high rates
of male typical fixed action

00:48:49.850 --> 00:48:50.630
patterns.

00:48:50.630 --> 00:48:55.330
So what we've got here is
a contingent organizational

00:48:55.330 --> 00:48:55.870
effect.

00:48:55.870 --> 00:48:59.270
Yet again, one of our
if-then clauses, this one

00:48:59.270 --> 00:49:03.770
not being an if this
physiology is going on only

00:49:03.770 --> 00:49:08.310
in this social environment, then
if this early life endocrine

00:49:08.310 --> 00:49:12.810
environment occurs coupled with
this acute adult one, then.

00:49:12.810 --> 00:49:14.401
Yeah, question.

00:49:14.401 --> 00:49:14.900
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:22.770
That is a great question,
and as you're about to see,

00:49:22.770 --> 00:49:25.540
the answer is so
insanely complicated, you

00:49:25.540 --> 00:49:28.310
are going to regret having
asked that question for days.

00:49:28.310 --> 00:49:31.342
But you are going to
find out about it anyway.

00:49:31.342 --> 00:49:33.300
Apropos of that, I just
forgot a great question

00:49:33.300 --> 00:49:35.510
during the break, which
is, OK, when you've

00:49:35.510 --> 00:49:39.280
got those weightlifter
folks, they're

00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:42.540
abusing their steroids,
their anabolic steroids,

00:49:42.540 --> 00:49:45.370
their testosterone-derived
drugs, when you push things up

00:49:45.370 --> 00:49:48.190
into the
supraphysiological range,

00:49:48.190 --> 00:49:50.690
higher than the body
normally ever comes up with,

00:49:50.690 --> 00:49:53.690
do you see a phenomenon
from last Wednesday?

00:49:53.690 --> 00:49:56.570
Does the body down
regulate the number

00:49:56.570 --> 00:49:58.470
of testosterone receptors?

00:49:58.470 --> 00:50:02.200
And you see exactly the case,
but you could never down

00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:04.930
regulate them low
enough to compensate

00:50:04.930 --> 00:50:07.820
for the huge screaming
testosterone signal.

00:50:07.820 --> 00:50:13.240
It is a partially successful
compensatory response.

00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:16.140
What have you got
in terms of humans,

00:50:16.140 --> 00:50:20.060
in terms of perinatal
androgenization of females?

00:50:20.060 --> 00:50:23.490
And people used to know
exactly the answer to it.

00:50:23.490 --> 00:50:27.320
First off, when do you get
human females as fetuses

00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:29.810
and as predominately in
humans prenatal, rather than

00:50:29.810 --> 00:50:31.120
postnatal effects?

00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:34.490
It depends on how fast,
how much of development

00:50:34.490 --> 00:50:36.860
occurs before birth,
but in humans,

00:50:36.860 --> 00:50:40.150
when are circumstances
where female fetuses will

00:50:40.150 --> 00:50:41.890
get heavily androgenized?

00:50:41.890 --> 00:50:44.480
Historically, two circumstances.

00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:48.000
One is in the case
of a disease where

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:50.220
there is something wrong
with the adrenal glands,

00:50:50.220 --> 00:50:53.190
and they pump out
tons of testosterone.

00:50:53.190 --> 00:50:55.649
You remember, if I
actually did say this,

00:50:55.649 --> 00:50:57.690
and if I didn't, I hope
you're not remembering it

00:50:57.690 --> 00:51:00.520
hallucinatorily,
but you'll remember

00:51:00.520 --> 00:51:04.700
that the adrenal glands make a
certain amount of testosterone,

00:51:04.700 --> 00:51:07.580
and in females, it
pumps out maybe 5%

00:51:07.580 --> 00:51:08.880
the levels that males do.

00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:13.350
When you have this disease of
an overactive adrenal system,

00:51:13.350 --> 00:51:16.890
you pump out way too high
of levels of testosterone,

00:51:16.890 --> 00:51:21.930
a disease called congenital
adrenal hyperplasia.

00:51:21.930 --> 00:51:26.300
Hyperplasia, the
number of cells-- OK,

00:51:26.300 --> 00:51:28.110
come up with a limerick
about that one.

00:51:28.110 --> 00:51:28.970
I dare you.

00:51:28.970 --> 00:51:30.610
Is it possible to
come up with a haiku?

00:51:30.610 --> 00:51:33.935
How many syllables are there in
congenital adrenal hyperplasia?

00:51:33.935 --> 00:51:36.270
Well, it depends if we're
talking about rodents or not.

00:51:36.270 --> 00:51:38.470
So congenital
adrenal hyperplasia,

00:51:38.470 --> 00:51:42.530
a genetic and inborn error
of metabolism in the adrenal

00:51:42.530 --> 00:51:45.850
glands, and you pump out
huge amounts of androgen.

00:51:45.850 --> 00:51:49.390
So suddenly, there is a world
of the occasional girl, who

00:51:49.390 --> 00:51:53.250
was born suffering from
this disorder or the mother

00:51:53.250 --> 00:51:55.470
suffering from it during
pregnancy, who has

00:51:55.470 --> 00:51:58.030
been prenatally androgenized.

00:51:58.030 --> 00:52:00.600
The other population,
thanks to a drug that

00:52:00.600 --> 00:52:04.070
was very popular in the
1950s, a drug that decreased

00:52:04.070 --> 00:52:07.410
the likelihood of miscarriage
that was very heavily used

00:52:07.410 --> 00:52:11.980
at points around then, a drug
called diethylstilbestrol, DES.

00:52:11.980 --> 00:52:15.740
And in a subset of
women, their biochemistry

00:52:15.740 --> 00:52:20.210
was such that a lot of the DES
was converted to androgens.

00:52:20.210 --> 00:52:25.040
So you had kids, who were
prenatally androgenized, girls,

00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:27.700
either because of this
congenital adrenal hyperplasia

00:52:27.700 --> 00:52:30.360
or because of DES exposure.

00:52:30.360 --> 00:52:33.450
So then the question
immediately becomes, OK,

00:52:33.450 --> 00:52:35.740
so what are they like afterward?

00:52:35.740 --> 00:52:39.110
And this prompted the
great, large, massive set

00:52:39.110 --> 00:52:42.780
of studies on the CAH, the
congenital adrenal hyperplasia,

00:52:42.780 --> 00:52:45.170
on the CAH girls
as they grow up,

00:52:45.170 --> 00:52:48.020
and you knew exactly what
the expectation was straight

00:52:48.020 --> 00:52:50.600
out of primates here,
non-human primates, which

00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:53.850
was this was going to
have masculinizing effects

00:52:53.850 --> 00:52:55.790
on their behavior.

00:52:55.790 --> 00:52:58.630
And what was shown
was in adulthood,

00:52:58.630 --> 00:53:00.460
there were all sorts
of differences.

00:53:00.460 --> 00:53:01.660
No, not just in adulthood.

00:53:01.660 --> 00:53:03.410
Starting around
adolescence, there

00:53:03.410 --> 00:53:06.760
were all sorts of differences
in the behaviors of these girls,

00:53:06.760 --> 00:53:09.980
and as we'll see next week,
a whole cluster of them

00:53:09.980 --> 00:53:13.040
were thought to fall into the
realm of aggressive behavior.

00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:15.850
But what we're seeing
here was eventually,

00:53:15.850 --> 00:53:19.400
a higher likelihood
of becoming a lesbian

00:53:19.400 --> 00:53:21.110
in terms of sexual orientation.

00:53:21.110 --> 00:53:21.970
Whoa.

00:53:21.970 --> 00:53:24.480
What we've just shown
is prenatal androgens,

00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:27.210
and you produce a
lesbian later on.

00:53:27.210 --> 00:53:30.090
That's just-- there's a little
problem with these studies,

00:53:30.090 --> 00:53:32.040
a slight confound,
and one that's

00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:33.670
going to be very
pertinent next week

00:53:33.670 --> 00:53:36.320
as well when talking about
the aggression stuff.

00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:39.770
The confound being if you
were prenatally androgenized,

00:53:39.770 --> 00:53:43.380
you would get born with
kind of weirdo genitals,

00:53:43.380 --> 00:53:46.210
and you would have sort
of intersexual genitals

00:53:46.210 --> 00:53:47.580
in all sorts of ways.

00:53:47.580 --> 00:53:49.840
And all of these
girls typically had

00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:52.300
to have gone through
a dozen rounds

00:53:52.300 --> 00:53:54.810
of reconstructive
plastic surgery

00:53:54.810 --> 00:53:56.910
over the first
decade of your life.

00:53:56.910 --> 00:53:59.950
These were not girls where the
only thing different about them

00:53:59.950 --> 00:54:02.530
was what sort of hormones
their brains were marinating

00:54:02.530 --> 00:54:04.270
in back when they were fetuses.

00:54:04.270 --> 00:54:08.460
These are girls who grow up with
this really interesting part

00:54:08.460 --> 00:54:10.320
of the body that
all sorts of people

00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:13.300
seem kind of creeped out about,
but doctors are endlessly

00:54:13.300 --> 00:54:16.490
examining, and all sorts
of painful surgeries.

00:54:16.490 --> 00:54:18.760
And this literature
was completely

00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:20.800
confounded by the
fact that there

00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:25.890
was all this masculinization
of genitalia and a whole world

00:54:25.890 --> 00:54:30.030
of surgeries, often confusion
about gender assignment

00:54:30.030 --> 00:54:31.260
early on in life.

00:54:31.260 --> 00:54:35.280
Things were not merely a
change in the hormone levels.

00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:38.100
So it remains
relatively unclear.

00:54:38.100 --> 00:54:40.650
There is by now, at this
point, weak evidence

00:54:40.650 --> 00:54:43.260
of prenatal
androgenization increasing

00:54:43.260 --> 00:54:47.400
the likelihood of a woman
being gay as an adult.

00:54:47.400 --> 00:54:50.550
I'm seeing here in my notes
I have the words Indonesia,

00:54:50.550 --> 00:54:53.140
tomboy, and Hobson Jobson.

00:54:53.140 --> 00:54:55.050
And I haven't a clue
what that's about.

00:54:55.050 --> 00:54:58.350
So we will just skip over that.

00:54:58.350 --> 00:54:59.780
OK.

00:54:59.780 --> 00:55:02.770
What we begin to see
here is another feature

00:55:02.770 --> 00:55:04.290
of early experience.

00:55:04.290 --> 00:55:08.340
What does-- where were we--
prenatal endocrine environment

00:55:08.340 --> 00:55:11.760
have to do with
sexual identification?

00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:14.790
Which is different than who
you are sexually attracted,

00:55:14.790 --> 00:55:17.550
but rather what sex you
feel yourself to be.

00:55:17.550 --> 00:55:21.660
And what we heard the other day
with the transsexualism example

00:55:21.660 --> 00:55:26.590
is you could have gender being
dictated by your chromosomes

00:55:26.590 --> 00:55:31.450
and which organ, which
types of gonads you have

00:55:31.450 --> 00:55:33.840
and hormones and all of
that, but that is not

00:55:33.840 --> 00:55:36.860
enough to determine that there
are clearly other things that

00:55:36.860 --> 00:55:40.070
can happen that could produce
a very, very different gender

00:55:40.070 --> 00:55:41.680
identity.

00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:45.400
What also was seen from that
literature of individuals

00:55:45.400 --> 00:55:49.180
who were born intersexual where
they have sexually ambiguous,

00:55:49.180 --> 00:55:54.070
gender ambiguous genitalia
is it is far from clear

00:55:54.070 --> 00:55:56.570
which decision to
make, whether that

00:55:56.570 --> 00:55:59.010
was made circa
1950s by the surgeon

00:55:59.010 --> 00:56:00.930
with no consultation
with the parents,

00:56:00.930 --> 00:56:04.410
or, fortunately, these days,
a very different scenario

00:56:04.410 --> 00:56:07.960
in terms of how successful
the assignment is

00:56:07.960 --> 00:56:10.150
by the individuals
in the outside world.

00:56:10.150 --> 00:56:14.010
What's going on in terms
of sexual identity inside?

00:56:14.010 --> 00:56:18.360
Now what this begins to bring
up is the most miserable,

00:56:18.360 --> 00:56:21.540
irritating, confusing
thing about the effects

00:56:21.540 --> 00:56:23.900
of steroid hormones
in the brain, which is

00:56:23.900 --> 00:56:25.290
where your question came from.

00:56:25.290 --> 00:56:27.750
And this is where you're all
going to start to regret this,

00:56:27.750 --> 00:56:31.990
but it actually is necessary
in terms of an important point.

00:56:31.990 --> 00:56:35.600
So you've got testosterone,
and what does testosterone do?

00:56:35.600 --> 00:56:41.130
We know already it binds
to testosterone receptors,

00:56:41.130 --> 00:56:44.080
testosterone receptor, and
does its steroid hormone

00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:46.060
transcription factor deal.

00:56:46.060 --> 00:56:50.680
Throughout the 1970s, there
was an astonishing amount

00:56:50.680 --> 00:56:54.720
of confusing irritative research
done showing the two following

00:56:54.720 --> 00:56:56.160
things.

00:56:56.160 --> 00:56:58.820
In some parts of the
body, testosterone

00:56:58.820 --> 00:57:01.620
has its effect as testosterone.

00:57:01.620 --> 00:57:04.030
It binds to the
testosterone receptor.

00:57:04.030 --> 00:57:08.480
In some parts of the body,
there is biochemical conversion

00:57:08.480 --> 00:57:10.830
of testosterone to something
called dihydrotestosterone.

00:57:13.290 --> 00:57:13.790
OK.

00:57:13.790 --> 00:57:14.846
It's not testosterone.

00:57:14.846 --> 00:57:16.470
It's a little bit
different chemically.

00:57:16.470 --> 00:57:18.700
It binds to the same
testosterone receptors.

00:57:18.700 --> 00:57:20.520
It works a little
bit differently.

00:57:20.520 --> 00:57:22.370
OK, we can live with that.

00:57:22.370 --> 00:57:25.150
The thing that had people
jumping off buildings

00:57:25.150 --> 00:57:28.070
was the discovery at
the time that some

00:57:28.070 --> 00:57:32.490
of testosterone's actions are
due to it being biochemically

00:57:32.490 --> 00:57:36.470
converted to estrogen,
which then binds

00:57:36.470 --> 00:57:41.401
to estrogen receptors and
causes male typical behaviors.

00:57:41.401 --> 00:57:41.900
OK.

00:57:41.900 --> 00:57:44.446
It's at this point that about
half the people in the field

00:57:44.446 --> 00:57:45.820
quit and went to
business school,

00:57:45.820 --> 00:57:49.710
because this was so confusing
and impossible and all of that.

00:57:49.710 --> 00:57:53.280
This consumed years
of labor of people

00:57:53.280 --> 00:57:54.810
trying to sort this one out.

00:57:54.810 --> 00:57:56.810
It goes as follows.

00:57:56.810 --> 00:58:00.430
Once testosterone
enters a target cell,

00:58:00.430 --> 00:58:02.760
if this is the scenario
that's going to happen,

00:58:02.760 --> 00:58:05.010
it's inside the cell.

00:58:05.010 --> 00:58:09.930
The testosterone is turned
to estrogen. In other words,

00:58:09.930 --> 00:58:13.110
this weirdo phenomenon has
no effect on circulating

00:58:13.110 --> 00:58:14.180
testosterone levels.

00:58:14.180 --> 00:58:17.790
It's only in target cells
that have the enzyme that

00:58:17.790 --> 00:58:19.040
could do that conversion.

00:58:19.040 --> 00:58:19.540
OK.

00:58:19.540 --> 00:58:22.010
So it's an intracellular
phenomenon.

00:58:22.010 --> 00:58:25.260
If this is leaving you
totally in the dust,

00:58:25.260 --> 00:58:28.460
don't worry about it, except for
a small point coming in awhile.

00:58:28.460 --> 00:58:30.470
But if you want to devote
the rest of your life

00:58:30.470 --> 00:58:32.074
to figuring this
out in more detail,

00:58:32.074 --> 00:58:33.490
there is something
wrong with you.

00:58:33.490 --> 00:58:36.490
But what you've
got here is normal

00:58:36.490 --> 00:58:39.000
circulating levels,
but different effects

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:40.010
throughout the body.

00:58:40.010 --> 00:58:43.890
In general, what is found is
the effects of testosterone

00:58:43.890 --> 00:58:48.960
in the brain involve this
turning into estrogen,

00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:51.620
as symbolized meaninglessly
by that asterisk.

00:58:51.620 --> 00:58:56.230
Throughout the genitals
or throughout the body,

00:58:56.230 --> 00:58:59.820
and secondary sexual
areas of skin and such,

00:58:59.820 --> 00:59:02.850
testosterone exerts its
effects by being turned

00:59:02.850 --> 00:59:04.670
into dihydrotestosterone.

00:59:04.670 --> 00:59:07.190
And whatever parts are
left over at that point,

00:59:07.190 --> 00:59:09.980
testosterone just does
its regular old thing.

00:59:09.980 --> 00:59:13.960
So this is incredibly
confusing how this can be.

00:59:13.960 --> 00:59:16.690
Immediately, or not so
immediately, two things

00:59:16.690 --> 00:59:17.700
should come to mind.

00:59:17.700 --> 00:59:22.280
OK, so prenatal
testosterone levels

00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:24.650
are going about
their normal prenatal

00:59:24.650 --> 00:59:28.520
organizational masculinization
effects, and part of it

00:59:28.520 --> 00:59:30.520
is on how the brain organizes.

00:59:30.520 --> 00:59:36.150
So what we just saw was prenatal
neurobiological masculinization

00:59:36.150 --> 00:59:39.270
requires testosterone
to be working

00:59:39.270 --> 00:59:43.260
like estrogen in the brain.

00:59:43.260 --> 00:59:47.730
Why don't all the female
fetuses then get androgenized?

00:59:47.730 --> 00:59:50.930
Since they're not generating
estrogen right on site there

00:59:50.930 --> 00:59:53.100
within the cell, but
they're getting estrogen

00:59:53.100 --> 00:59:55.860
through some other route
as their fetal ovaries

00:59:55.860 --> 00:59:56.650
start to work.

00:59:56.650 --> 01:00:00.220
Why isn't mom and her
estrogen androgenizing

01:00:00.220 --> 01:00:02.230
every single fetus out there?

01:00:02.230 --> 01:00:04.970
How is it possible
to ever get a female?

01:00:04.970 --> 01:00:07.590
And the answer to
that is there is

01:00:07.590 --> 01:00:11.370
a protein, which occurs
during pregnancy,

01:00:11.370 --> 01:00:14.050
that occurs in the circulation.

01:00:14.050 --> 01:00:18.240
And what it does is
it binds estrogen,

01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:20.040
and it takes it out of action.

01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:22.476
It leads to estrogen
being degraded.

01:00:22.476 --> 01:00:27.440
In other words, estrogen in
the bloodstream of a fetus

01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:30.970
never has an effect on
any cells in the body.

01:00:30.970 --> 01:00:33.800
Estrogen, whether derived from
the female fetus beginning

01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:37.820
to get her ovaries going there,
or from mom's circulation,

01:00:37.820 --> 01:00:40.120
the estrogen has no effect.

01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:42.710
And in other words,
the only fetuses

01:00:42.710 --> 01:00:45.980
that ever have estrogen
inside their neurons

01:00:45.980 --> 01:00:49.080
are fetuses that are male,
where the estrogen came

01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:51.160
from testosterone.

01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:53.720
So you have to
have this protein,

01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:56.270
and it's something
called alpha fetoprotein.

01:00:56.270 --> 01:00:57.990
It only occurs in fetal life.

01:00:57.990 --> 01:00:59.540
This winds up
being the solution.

01:00:59.540 --> 01:01:02.250
What is implicit
in that, you do not

01:01:02.250 --> 01:01:07.350
get the organizational
feminizing effects of hormones

01:01:07.350 --> 01:01:10.730
prenatally because of
estrogen, because you've just

01:01:10.730 --> 01:01:12.030
guaranteed that doesn't happen.

01:01:12.030 --> 01:01:14.380
You're getting androgenizing
effects that way.

01:01:14.380 --> 01:01:17.100
You don't get prenatal
feminizing effects

01:01:17.100 --> 01:01:20.920
from estrogen. Where does the
brain feminization come from?

01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:23.650
The irritating
answer back when was

01:01:23.650 --> 01:01:26.260
this was always-- sort
of the same phrase

01:01:26.260 --> 01:01:30.760
was always used that the female
brain is a default brain.

01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:37.240
You have to actively in a
muscular excited chopping down

01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:39.290
the trees and clearing
the prairie sort of way,

01:01:39.290 --> 01:01:41.470
you have to actively
do something hormonal

01:01:41.470 --> 01:01:43.110
to masculinize a brain.

01:01:43.110 --> 01:01:45.960
And in the absence of that,
you just kind of wind up

01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:47.840
with one of them female brains.

01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:51.290
What's clear now is this default
model was not really the case.

01:01:51.290 --> 01:01:53.970
It's other hormones that
are doing that there.

01:01:53.970 --> 01:01:54.470
OK.

01:01:54.470 --> 01:01:57.380
So this totally confusing,
irritating thing

01:01:57.380 --> 01:02:01.060
that everybody had to assimilate
at the time of testosterone

01:02:01.060 --> 01:02:04.340
having different effects,
having been converted

01:02:04.340 --> 01:02:06.900
to different messengers in
different parts of the body,

01:02:06.900 --> 01:02:12.440
and that having to produce this
whole complex Rube Goldberg

01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:15.980
sort of solution as to
how to ever get a female.

01:02:15.980 --> 01:02:19.150
Now one additional
interesting implication--

01:02:19.150 --> 01:02:23.170
back to, you remember the other
week, remember-- actually,

01:02:23.170 --> 01:02:27.090
did I talk about it, or
was it two years ago?

01:02:27.090 --> 01:02:27.950
Jeez.

01:02:27.950 --> 01:02:28.610
OK.

01:02:28.610 --> 01:02:32.020
I think I mentioned
testicular feminized males.

01:02:32.020 --> 01:02:32.620
Yes.

01:02:32.620 --> 01:02:32.930
Good.

01:02:32.930 --> 01:02:33.429
OK.

01:02:33.429 --> 01:02:35.530
Thank you for the grounding.

01:02:35.530 --> 01:02:37.400
You remember when
those folks were about.

01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:40.650
This was someone who was
phenotypically a girl

01:02:40.650 --> 01:02:43.430
and would not hit
puberty, would not

01:02:43.430 --> 01:02:48.190
start menstruating until
every other kid in her grade

01:02:48.190 --> 01:02:50.220
had, and it still
hasn't happened,

01:02:50.220 --> 01:02:51.230
still hasn't happened.

01:02:51.230 --> 01:02:53.510
And you take her to the
doctor, and what is discovered

01:02:53.510 --> 01:02:55.260
is that she is not female.

01:02:55.260 --> 01:02:57.860
She is a testicular
feminized male,

01:02:57.860 --> 01:02:59.740
and we went through
exactly what the building

01:02:59.740 --> 01:03:01.110
blocks were of that.

01:03:01.110 --> 01:03:04.150
The individual is
chromosomally male,

01:03:04.150 --> 01:03:07.610
has testes, undescended
testes, is producing

01:03:07.610 --> 01:03:08.990
tons and tons of testosterone.

01:03:08.990 --> 01:03:11.000
What was the problem there?

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:12.970
We knew already it
was the mutation

01:03:12.970 --> 01:03:15.980
in the testosterone receptor.

01:03:15.980 --> 01:03:19.510
So if testosterone
is not able to send

01:03:19.510 --> 01:03:22.020
a signal through the
testosterone receptor,

01:03:22.020 --> 01:03:26.050
you don't get a male
phenotype, and you

01:03:26.050 --> 01:03:30.000
get an individual whose
sexual identity is female,

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.450
because these are
people who are girls

01:03:32.450 --> 01:03:34.460
and grow up to
become women, women

01:03:34.460 --> 01:03:36.090
who simply can't reproduce.

01:03:36.090 --> 01:03:41.140
But otherwise, the sexual
identification is female.

01:03:41.140 --> 01:03:43.090
This should be
really puzzling now,

01:03:43.090 --> 01:03:45.560
because what we've
just seen is if you

01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:48.950
have this mutation in the
testosterone receptor,

01:03:48.950 --> 01:03:52.130
you're not going to get
any signaling mediated

01:03:52.130 --> 01:03:54.170
by testosterone.

01:03:54.170 --> 01:03:56.850
You're not going to get
any signaling mediated

01:03:56.850 --> 01:03:59.160
by dihydrotestosterone.

01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:01.740
But you're going to
get perfectly normal

01:04:01.740 --> 01:04:04.280
masculinization of
the brain by way

01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:07.070
of estrogen. In
other words, people

01:04:07.070 --> 01:04:09.950
who were testicular
feminized males, who

01:04:09.950 --> 01:04:12.280
in terms of their
sex identification,

01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:14.810
have been female from
day one and will be

01:04:14.810 --> 01:04:18.590
for their entire lives,
nonetheless, prenatally

01:04:18.590 --> 01:04:21.690
they had masculinization
organizational effects

01:04:21.690 --> 01:04:22.630
on the brain.

01:04:22.630 --> 01:04:24.220
What does that tell you?

01:04:24.220 --> 01:04:27.260
All of this great hormone
stuff, in some cases,

01:04:27.260 --> 01:04:32.510
doesn't hold a candle to social
sex identity assignment, which

01:04:32.510 --> 01:04:34.850
is when you have
somebody growing up

01:04:34.850 --> 01:04:39.080
with a certain gender's
genitals, and all of you

01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:41.210
treat that individual as a girl.

01:04:41.210 --> 01:04:43.890
It turns out virtually
100% of the time,

01:04:43.890 --> 01:04:47.480
it doesn't matter that you
still had this pathway working

01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:48.440
prenatally.

01:04:48.440 --> 01:04:53.710
All the social cueing produces
a female sexual identity.

01:04:53.710 --> 01:04:57.130
So we've just gotten a big,
big vote here for this.

01:04:57.130 --> 01:04:59.990
It's doing all sorts of
exciting endocrine stuff there,

01:04:59.990 --> 01:05:02.990
which nonetheless,
may not hold a candle

01:05:02.990 --> 01:05:07.030
to some social environmental
factors at this end.

01:05:07.030 --> 01:05:07.660
OK.

01:05:07.660 --> 01:05:11.359
What else do we have here?

01:05:11.359 --> 01:05:12.900
Something I don't
want to talk about.

01:05:12.900 --> 01:05:13.410
OK.

01:05:13.410 --> 01:05:18.650
So hurtling on, now we are ready
to move back another box here,

01:05:18.650 --> 01:05:20.450
which is genetics.

01:05:20.450 --> 01:05:24.030
What does the genetic makeup
up of an individual, not of

01:05:24.030 --> 01:05:26.570
a population or
species, what do genes

01:05:26.570 --> 01:05:29.050
have to do with sexual behavior?

01:05:29.050 --> 01:05:33.050
And the answer is lots of
things, starting with the fact

01:05:33.050 --> 01:05:37.880
that genes determine which
gonads you make as a fetus.

01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:40.900
And thus, that determines
which sex hormones

01:05:40.900 --> 01:05:42.810
you were secreting,
and thus, that

01:05:42.810 --> 01:05:45.580
determines what sort of
genitals you wind up with

01:05:45.580 --> 01:05:49.460
and secondary sexual stuff, and
off you go running with that.

01:05:49.460 --> 01:05:53.100
And we've seen that nonetheless,
that can be blunted by,

01:05:53.100 --> 01:05:56.380
depending on the environment,
the testicular feminized

01:05:56.380 --> 01:05:58.760
male pathway here showing that.

01:05:58.760 --> 01:06:04.070
So genes play a role in terms
of just sheer sex determination.

01:06:04.070 --> 01:06:08.610
What is known about genes
and sexual orientation?

01:06:08.610 --> 01:06:10.740
This has been studied
a lot, because this

01:06:10.740 --> 01:06:13.210
is one of those
irresistible subjects

01:06:13.210 --> 01:06:15.380
that, ooh, people just
can't get enough of.

01:06:15.380 --> 01:06:16.590
What's up with that?

01:06:16.590 --> 01:06:18.340
What does the literature show?

01:06:18.340 --> 01:06:22.930
A certain degree of heritability
of sexual orientation, and you

01:06:22.930 --> 01:06:25.640
should be able to leap up right
now and say exactly what that

01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:26.870
means and doesn't mean.

01:06:26.870 --> 01:06:28.620
Here's the sort of evidence.

01:06:28.620 --> 01:06:31.500
Twin studies, twin
studies-- when

01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:34.710
you look at monozygotic
twins, identical twins,

01:06:34.710 --> 01:06:38.560
there's approximately
50% concordance

01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:41.060
of sexual orientation.

01:06:41.060 --> 01:06:43.650
Translated into the terms
that people are usually

01:06:43.650 --> 01:06:46.610
focusing on in those
studies, which is to say,

01:06:46.610 --> 01:06:49.060
if somebody is gay,
their identical twins

01:06:49.060 --> 01:06:52.310
has a 50% chance of being gay.

01:06:52.310 --> 01:06:56.760
Dizygotic twins, non-identical
twins-- what is the number?

01:06:56.760 --> 01:07:00.380
Instead it's 22% covariance.

01:07:00.380 --> 01:07:02.990
What's the number
with other siblings?

01:07:02.990 --> 01:07:05.310
9% covariance.

01:07:05.310 --> 01:07:06.640
So what do we see here?

01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:09.030
We see a suggestion
that the more genes you

01:07:09.030 --> 01:07:12.330
have in common with somebody,
but also the more prenatal

01:07:12.330 --> 01:07:15.630
environment you had with
your non-identical twin, all

01:07:15.630 --> 01:07:17.850
of that stuff, the greater
the likelihood of sharing

01:07:17.850 --> 01:07:19.660
a trait of sexual orientation.

01:07:19.660 --> 01:07:23.380
And you can be off and running
right now about the limitations

01:07:23.380 --> 01:07:27.260
of that interpretation,
because obviously, this

01:07:27.260 --> 01:07:29.560
suggests genetic
effects, and it also

01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:33.210
suggests the whole world of
identical twins being treated

01:07:33.210 --> 01:07:36.440
differently than
non-identical ones.

01:07:36.440 --> 01:07:39.240
One additional piece
in that story, and this

01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:43.110
was another one of those front
page stories in Time, Newsweek,

01:07:43.110 --> 01:07:45.070
et cetera, and this
came a couple of years

01:07:45.070 --> 01:07:49.410
after Simon Levey's finding of
that sexually dimorphic nucleus

01:07:49.410 --> 01:07:51.100
in the brain, that
whole deal there.

01:07:51.100 --> 01:07:55.060
And this was the reporting
of the first genetic markers

01:07:55.060 --> 01:07:57.450
for sexual orientation.

01:07:57.450 --> 01:07:59.680
And this was reported
by a geneticist

01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:01.310
at National Institute
of Health, a guy

01:08:01.310 --> 01:08:05.610
named Dean Hamer, who was a
very well-respected geneticist.

01:08:05.610 --> 01:08:11.020
And what he reported was that
he was finding genetic markers

01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:13.410
for sexual orientation.

01:08:13.410 --> 01:08:16.660
In other words, certain
gene locations that

01:08:16.660 --> 01:08:21.069
were more likely to be shared
between gay siblings, where

01:08:21.069 --> 01:08:25.189
both were gay, than
between partially

01:08:25.189 --> 01:08:29.193
gay siblings or non-gay siblings
or however that one runs.

01:08:29.193 --> 01:08:30.720
You know that one by now.

01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:33.334
Beginning to find genetic
markers going with this.

01:08:33.334 --> 01:08:37.149
This was really interesting,
and no surprise--

01:08:37.149 --> 01:08:39.630
what the newspapers were
screaming about within days

01:08:39.630 --> 01:08:41.210
was scientists
announced today they

01:08:41.210 --> 01:08:45.870
have discovered the gay gene.

01:08:45.870 --> 01:08:46.600
Great.

01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:50.040
Maybe we shouldn't let people
learn any science out there.

01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:53.520
So scientists have
discovered the gay gene.

01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:55.840
It goes to all the newspapers
and Reader's Digest,

01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:58.609
and if I recall at the
time, Ronald Reagan as well,

01:08:58.609 --> 01:09:01.099
but he was completely
demented at that point,

01:09:01.099 --> 01:09:02.390
so I won't hold it against him.

01:09:02.390 --> 01:09:04.660
But the people at Newsweek
should have known better.

01:09:04.660 --> 01:09:08.180
So we have cover stories
about the gay gene.

01:09:08.180 --> 01:09:10.880
Obviously, you can rip
this to shreds right now.

01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:13.160
Number one, this was not a gene.

01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:14.770
This was a genetic marker.

01:09:14.770 --> 01:09:18.319
You remember the other
week, the difference there.

01:09:18.319 --> 01:09:23.490
Number two, there was
no consistency in this.

01:09:23.490 --> 01:09:25.085
What do I mean by this?

01:09:25.085 --> 01:09:28.649
This pair of
identical twins would

01:09:28.649 --> 01:09:32.859
tend to share a certain genetic
marker, which was predictive

01:09:32.859 --> 01:09:34.560
of sexual orientation.

01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:39.609
And the next pair over, it
wasn't the same area of genes

01:09:39.609 --> 01:09:41.370
that showed that covariance.

01:09:41.370 --> 01:09:43.149
It would be a completely
different area

01:09:43.149 --> 01:09:44.439
that they had in common.

01:09:44.439 --> 01:09:47.020
In another pair, a
completely different area,

01:09:47.020 --> 01:09:52.189
you got this genetic covariance
in various twin pairs,

01:09:52.189 --> 01:09:55.500
but it wasn't the same gene
marker in all those cases.

01:09:55.500 --> 01:09:57.260
All of them were
different, which

01:09:57.260 --> 01:10:00.250
makes zero sense in
terms of the genetics.

01:10:00.250 --> 01:10:03.370
The biggest problem with it
is that since then, all sorts

01:10:03.370 --> 01:10:05.320
of people have tried to
replicate the finding,

01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:07.110
and it has never
been replicated.

01:10:07.110 --> 01:10:10.610
Nonetheless, Hamer became
quite famous for this.

01:10:10.610 --> 01:10:13.340
He is gay, and he used this
sort of politically some

01:10:13.340 --> 01:10:16.550
of the same ways that Simon
Levey did with his study, which

01:10:16.550 --> 01:10:18.370
is, don't tell me about choice.

01:10:18.370 --> 01:10:21.220
Don't tell me about my
neurotic mother anymore.

01:10:21.220 --> 01:10:25.300
We are looking at a very hard
wired biological trait-- what

01:10:25.300 --> 01:10:27.050
sexual orientation you have.

01:10:27.050 --> 01:10:29.450
Levey's finding I have
found quite convincing

01:10:29.450 --> 01:10:31.010
in terms of replications.

01:10:31.010 --> 01:10:34.910
Hamer's-- nobody else has
replicated any actual genetics

01:10:34.910 --> 01:10:36.010
that he reported.

01:10:36.010 --> 01:10:37.910
Makes no sense at all.

01:10:37.910 --> 01:10:41.730
So great limitations in
what you could make of this.

01:10:41.730 --> 01:10:42.390
OK.

01:10:42.390 --> 01:10:46.040
This allows us to make our
great final leap to the left

01:10:46.040 --> 01:10:47.640
with this thing,
this logic that's

01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:49.950
going to run through
everything we talk about,

01:10:49.950 --> 01:10:52.850
which is the second you're
talking about genes,

01:10:52.850 --> 01:10:57.600
you are implicitly talking
about the evolutionary history

01:10:57.600 --> 01:10:59.910
that brought about the
existence of those genes.

01:10:59.910 --> 01:11:03.480
And that you're also talking
about the proteins made

01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:06.750
by those genes and early
environment changing

01:11:06.750 --> 01:11:10.430
the epigenetic state of
transcribing those genes.

01:11:10.430 --> 01:11:12.320
Yes, yes, that whole
song and dance now.

01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:16.960
So now we have to transition to,
what does evolutionary biology

01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:19.330
tell us about sexual behavior?

01:11:19.330 --> 01:11:22.290
So the first thing that it tells
us is absolutely obvious, which

01:11:22.290 --> 01:11:26.520
is organisms have sex for
the good of the species.

01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:27.900
So that one's out of the way.

01:11:27.900 --> 01:11:31.630
So now we go to what is
much more logically in terms

01:11:31.630 --> 01:11:34.180
of contemporary, evolutionary
thinking-- contemporary

01:11:34.180 --> 01:11:37.450
starting circa 1965 or
so-- the whole notion

01:11:37.450 --> 01:11:40.200
of maximizing the number of
copies of your own genes,

01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:44.230
all of that translated into
sort of the economic terms

01:11:44.230 --> 01:11:45.950
of [INAUDIBLE] copies of genes.

01:11:45.950 --> 01:11:49.090
What that basically
states is sexual behavior

01:11:49.090 --> 01:11:51.660
is about reproduction.

01:11:51.660 --> 01:11:54.640
And people who would
study phenomena

01:11:54.640 --> 01:11:57.050
like these in various
rodent species

01:11:57.050 --> 01:12:00.400
or wildebeest ovulating the
same afternoon, all of that,

01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:04.850
would say, yes, indeed, you
only have sexual behavior

01:12:04.850 --> 01:12:10.230
when it's around the time when
females are ovulating and yes.

01:12:10.230 --> 01:12:12.800
Reproductive behavior
is about reproduction.

01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:14.970
It's about passing
on copies of genes.

01:12:14.970 --> 01:12:19.200
What soon began to fall apart
was not only making sense of us

01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:23.360
with our having non-reproductive
sex all sorts of times,

01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:25.980
was the discovery that we're
not the only species that

01:12:25.980 --> 01:12:26.760
does that.

01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:30.010
And far and away
the flagship species

01:12:30.010 --> 01:12:34.700
as a sort of emblem of
that are bonobo chimps,

01:12:34.700 --> 01:12:38.130
who are, according to almost
all primatologists out there,

01:12:38.130 --> 01:12:40.413
the coolest primate
species there is.

01:12:40.413 --> 01:12:40.913
OK.

01:12:40.913 --> 01:12:42.620
Bonobo chimps-- they
were historically

01:12:42.620 --> 01:12:46.850
known as pygmy chimps, which is
to say that when people first

01:12:46.850 --> 01:12:49.220
discovered them in
terms of scientists,

01:12:49.220 --> 01:12:51.200
they were viewed as,
well, these are chimps,

01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:54.284
but they're just kind of
weirdo atrophied chimps, which

01:12:54.284 --> 01:12:55.700
I don't quite know
how you come up

01:12:55.700 --> 01:12:58.170
with a pygmy atrophied
chimp, but that was the view.

01:12:58.170 --> 01:13:00.680
And not very interesting--
what eventually became clear

01:13:00.680 --> 01:13:03.780
is they are a separate
species of chimp,

01:13:03.780 --> 01:13:06.610
and bonobo chimps
are utterly different

01:13:06.610 --> 01:13:10.510
from your standard issue
Jane Goodall chimps.

01:13:10.510 --> 01:13:14.010
Again, Jane Goodall chimps,
we have a tournament species

01:13:14.010 --> 01:13:17.140
with extreme high levels
of male aggression.

01:13:17.140 --> 01:13:19.260
As we will hear
about next week, you

01:13:19.260 --> 01:13:21.620
have chimps who are
building weapons.

01:13:21.620 --> 01:13:23.630
You have chimps
that form something

01:13:23.630 --> 01:13:26.880
resembling organized
warfare, and meanwhile,

01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:29.840
over, as it turned out, on
the other side of the Congo,

01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:31.930
which is where the
main division occurs,

01:13:31.930 --> 01:13:35.490
you only find bonobos in
one area of the Congo basin,

01:13:35.490 --> 01:13:38.220
and they clearly have been
reproductively isolated

01:13:38.220 --> 01:13:40.400
from all the rest of
the chimps heading there

01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:43.850
east all the way to the Indian
Ocean by way of the Congo.

01:13:43.850 --> 01:13:45.830
There, go on the other
side of the river.

01:13:45.830 --> 01:13:50.530
You've got the bonobos, and
bonobos are totally different.

01:13:50.530 --> 01:13:56.170
Bonobos, unlike chimps, have
virtually no sexual dimorphism,

01:13:56.170 --> 01:13:58.250
so you're off and
running with that one.

01:13:58.250 --> 01:14:00.380
We know exactly what that means.

01:14:00.380 --> 01:14:05.970
Bonobo chimps have female
dominance rather than male.

01:14:05.970 --> 01:14:09.558
All bonobo chimps play the
guitar and sing soulfully.

01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:13.560
What else?

01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:16.740
And we have astonishing
amounts of sex.

01:14:16.740 --> 01:14:17.600
Wait a second.

01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:19.380
We just went off the rails here.

01:14:19.380 --> 01:14:21.960
A species with low degrees
of aggression, because they

01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:24.080
have virtually no aggression
whatsoever, species

01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:27.970
with low degree of aggression
and with no sexual dimorphism

01:14:27.970 --> 01:14:29.760
in body size-- what
we're looking at

01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:32.790
is a pair bonding species,
a monogamous species.

01:14:32.790 --> 01:14:36.110
Bonobos are not a
monogamous species.

01:14:36.110 --> 01:14:40.590
Bonobos make-- I don't know
who-- look like a pair bonding

01:14:40.590 --> 01:14:41.820
species by comparison.

01:14:41.820 --> 01:14:46.050
Bonobos are the most sexually
promiscuous species on Earth.

01:14:46.050 --> 01:14:49.300
Bonobos have astonishing
amounts of sex

01:14:49.300 --> 01:14:52.390
with every other type of
bonobo they could run into.

01:14:52.390 --> 01:14:54.750
They have sex in
order to reproduce.

01:14:54.750 --> 01:14:57.360
They have sex in order
to decrease tensions.

01:14:57.360 --> 01:14:59.010
They have sex in
order to celebrate

01:14:59.010 --> 01:15:00.610
having decreased tensions.

01:15:00.610 --> 01:15:03.290
They have sex, because it's an
even numbered day of the month,

01:15:03.290 --> 01:15:04.420
because this is odd.

01:15:04.420 --> 01:15:07.250
Every variety, and
the vast majority

01:15:07.250 --> 01:15:10.490
of it being non-reproductive,
non-reproductive

01:15:10.490 --> 01:15:14.280
because it's not at a time
when anybody's ovulating,

01:15:14.280 --> 01:15:16.400
or because it's with
someone of the same sex,

01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:19.190
or it involves sexual behavior,
which traditionally does not

01:15:19.190 --> 01:15:21.760
result in eggs getting
fertilized and all sorts

01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:24.162
of variants that
people only dream about

01:15:24.162 --> 01:15:25.620
from buying books
and trying to get

01:15:25.620 --> 01:15:27.120
lessons and this sort of thing.

01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:29.320
And you have, perhaps,
having something

01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:32.520
to do with that astonishingly
limber spinal columns,

01:15:32.520 --> 01:15:34.830
but what you've got is a
totally different picture.

01:15:34.830 --> 01:15:35.760
Wait a second.

01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:38.540
They are very low
aggression, and they

01:15:38.540 --> 01:15:41.110
have no sexual dimorphism,
but they're as far

01:15:41.110 --> 01:15:43.010
from pair bonding
as you can get.

01:15:43.010 --> 01:15:46.080
And instead, you have a highly
promiscuous social system,

01:15:46.080 --> 01:15:47.810
female-dominated,
and they're all

01:15:47.810 --> 01:15:50.490
just so cool and wonderful
you can't believe it.

01:15:50.490 --> 01:15:53.120
And every time people go
to primatology meetings,

01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:56.740
if you study some dumb old
stupid species like a baboon,

01:15:56.740 --> 01:15:58.580
you spend the whole
time basically feeling

01:15:58.580 --> 01:16:00.320
like you're some sort
of immature jerk,

01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:02.390
because you're not
hanging out with bonobos.

01:16:02.390 --> 01:16:05.460
They are the kings of
primatologists these days,

01:16:05.460 --> 01:16:06.830
the people who study bonobos.

01:16:06.830 --> 01:16:10.600
As the soundbite goes,
chimpanzees are from Mars.

01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:13.540
Bonobos are from Venus.

01:16:13.540 --> 01:16:14.110
OK.

01:16:14.110 --> 01:16:17.040
So that's what the t-shirts
say from the bonobo people

01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:18.460
at the conferences there.

01:16:18.460 --> 01:16:19.810
Totally different system.

01:16:19.810 --> 01:16:22.960
So what we already see is
violating our simple rules

01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:25.220
of what predicts a
tournament species

01:16:25.220 --> 01:16:26.850
and what predicts
a pair bonding one.

01:16:26.850 --> 01:16:29.979
What's most striking
here is [INAUDIBLE]

01:16:29.979 --> 01:16:31.520
reproductive behavior
is reproduction

01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:32.970
for passing on
copies of the genes,

01:16:32.970 --> 01:16:34.020
not for the good of the species.

01:16:34.020 --> 01:16:36.145
But we know individual
selection could [INAUDIBLE].

01:16:36.145 --> 01:16:39.430
And here's these guys having
sex with 14 other bonobos

01:16:39.430 --> 01:16:42.140
while they're all upside
down or who knows what,

01:16:42.140 --> 01:16:46.700
and it's not just for passing
on numbers of copies of genes.

01:16:46.700 --> 01:16:49.240
Huge, huge exception there.

01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:52.050
And huge exception in
lots of other species.

01:16:52.050 --> 01:16:54.180
And the ecologist
Joan Roughgarden

01:16:54.180 --> 01:16:56.110
here in the biology
department has

01:16:56.110 --> 01:16:59.860
made an argument there is far
more non-reproductive sex that

01:16:59.860 --> 01:17:01.770
goes on in lots of
different species,

01:17:01.770 --> 01:17:05.470
weakening the classic
Darwinian concept from three,

01:17:05.470 --> 01:17:07.870
four weeks ago of
sexual selection

01:17:07.870 --> 01:17:10.380
being a very important
driving force.

01:17:10.380 --> 01:17:12.992
What sex is very heavily
about is one gender choosing

01:17:12.992 --> 01:17:14.700
who are going to mate
with the other one,

01:17:14.700 --> 01:17:17.200
and it's all driven by
that of seeing instead

01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:19.390
if the world of
bonobos, there's not

01:17:19.390 --> 01:17:23.670
a whole lot of evolutionary
drive being built around sex

01:17:23.670 --> 01:17:25.460
equals reproduction.

01:17:25.460 --> 01:17:27.890
So bonobos are
really interesting.

01:17:27.890 --> 01:17:30.030
What's the sex there about?

01:17:30.030 --> 01:17:31.880
One of the common themes
that comes through

01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:35.140
is it's about promoting
group cohesion,

01:17:35.140 --> 01:17:38.360
and one of the things that
people emphasize or focus on

01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:42.120
with bonobos is you look at all
sorts of other primate species,

01:17:42.120 --> 01:17:44.870
and what do they do when
they're upset about something?

01:17:44.870 --> 01:17:45.942
They groom each other.

01:17:45.942 --> 01:17:47.400
What do they do
when they're happy?

01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:48.090
They groom.

01:17:48.090 --> 01:17:49.860
What do they do--
social grooming,

01:17:49.860 --> 01:17:54.440
as termed the social glue, the
social lubricant of a society.

01:17:54.440 --> 01:17:56.210
You get a troop of
baboons that have just

01:17:56.210 --> 01:17:58.710
gotten a bad scare from
a lion, and as soon

01:17:58.710 --> 01:18:00.950
as the coast is clear,
everybody comes down

01:18:00.950 --> 01:18:03.500
and spends the next 30
minutes grooming each other.

01:18:03.500 --> 01:18:06.680
And sexual behavior
in bonobos appears

01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:09.020
to be serving a
very similar role--

01:18:09.020 --> 01:18:13.010
all about social cohesion
as well as decreasing

01:18:13.010 --> 01:18:15.470
individual tensions,
reconciliation,

01:18:15.470 --> 01:18:17.490
things of that sort.

01:18:17.490 --> 01:18:21.540
Now this flies on the face of a
dominant theory that was around

01:18:21.540 --> 01:18:23.570
in the last century,
the first part of it,

01:18:23.570 --> 01:18:26.040
and this was due to one
of the grand poobahs

01:18:26.040 --> 01:18:29.840
in this field, a guy, this
Brit named Solly Zuckerman.

01:18:29.840 --> 01:18:33.200
Solly Zuckerman, who eventually
became Sir Solly Zuckerman,

01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:35.290
which probably didn't
help him in society at all

01:18:35.290 --> 01:18:38.400
still despite that,
but old Zuckerman there

01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:42.110
was, for his time, the
embarrassed Wynne Edwards.

01:18:42.110 --> 01:18:43.860
He was the Lamarck
of the earliest

01:18:43.860 --> 01:18:45.290
part of the 20th century.

01:18:45.290 --> 01:18:47.240
The people who will
only be remembered

01:18:47.240 --> 01:18:49.850
for coming up with
Lamarckianism, old Lamarck

01:18:49.850 --> 01:18:52.710
or coming up with something
as idiotic as group selection.

01:18:52.710 --> 01:18:55.450
What Zuckerman came
up with was the notion

01:18:55.450 --> 01:19:00.690
that sexual behavior is purely
for promoting group cohesion

01:19:00.690 --> 01:19:02.890
and for decreasing violence.

01:19:02.890 --> 01:19:06.080
And all you need to do is go
to half the movies out there

01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:08.160
or study half the
species on Earth,

01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:11.890
and what you will see is
sexual behavior or inability of

01:19:11.890 --> 01:19:15.030
or unrequited or
whatever vanquished

01:19:15.030 --> 01:19:19.130
is the cause of the majority
of aggression in organisms

01:19:19.130 --> 01:19:22.670
out there in various
mammals, and that argues

01:19:22.670 --> 01:19:24.600
very strongly against it.

01:19:24.600 --> 01:19:28.020
So what you see in most species
that have been studied--

01:19:28.020 --> 01:19:31.280
it's a strong argument
against the Zuckerman stance.

01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:34.590
Nonetheless, you see in
some species like bonobos

01:19:34.590 --> 01:19:37.290
and Roughgarden's
argument, lots more species

01:19:37.290 --> 01:19:39.020
than people traditionally
would think,

01:19:39.020 --> 01:19:42.830
where instead you see sexual
behavior often serving

01:19:42.830 --> 01:19:47.800
a non-reproductive group
cohesion sort of role.

01:19:47.800 --> 01:19:51.620
What else does evolution have to
tell us about sexual behavior?

01:19:51.620 --> 01:19:53.930
One critical issue and
one that was touched

01:19:53.930 --> 01:19:56.510
on the first couple of
lectures is, what does it

01:19:56.510 --> 01:19:58.560
cost you to reproduce?

01:19:58.560 --> 01:20:02.740
And there we get the
hugely important asymmetry,

01:20:02.740 --> 01:20:06.620
which is sperm don't cost
a whole lot, whereas eggs

01:20:06.620 --> 01:20:10.620
and pregnancy and postnatal
care and all of that

01:20:10.620 --> 01:20:12.000
is hugely expensive.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.200
What is that the
driving force on

01:20:14.200 --> 01:20:16.770
according to all the
sociobiological thinking?

01:20:16.770 --> 01:20:19.420
The fact that in species
after species after species,

01:20:19.420 --> 01:20:22.000
females are more
selective about who

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.700
they will mate with than
males, and it's usually

01:20:24.700 --> 01:20:27.870
the case the males are not
selective in the slightest.

01:20:27.870 --> 01:20:29.690
And what you've
got instead is just

01:20:29.690 --> 01:20:32.550
a couple of sperm that accost
you, and that's not a big deal.

01:20:32.550 --> 01:20:36.790
Increased female selectivity,
higher levels of it than males,

01:20:36.790 --> 01:20:39.840
argument being that it is
all about the differential

01:20:39.840 --> 01:20:42.410
costs of pregnancy.

01:20:42.410 --> 01:20:45.070
What we also saw was
not of pregnancy,

01:20:45.070 --> 01:20:47.540
but of reproduction
and raising of kids.

01:20:47.540 --> 01:20:49.420
What we saw was the
interesting realm

01:20:49.420 --> 01:20:51.500
where you got the
exception to that, which

01:20:51.500 --> 01:20:53.670
were the pair bonding species.

01:20:53.670 --> 01:20:56.560
The marmosets, for example,
and what we saw back

01:20:56.560 --> 01:21:00.910
when was the male does as
much child care as the female

01:21:00.910 --> 01:21:03.650
does, and the
females always twin.

01:21:03.650 --> 01:21:06.030
So around the time
that the kids are born,

01:21:06.030 --> 01:21:08.890
the female has put in far
more of the investment.

01:21:08.890 --> 01:21:10.790
She's gone through
the pregnancy in terms

01:21:10.790 --> 01:21:12.320
of caloric expenditure.

01:21:12.320 --> 01:21:15.770
The males do, if anything,
more of the child rearing

01:21:15.770 --> 01:21:18.090
in terms of carrying the
kid around when foraging,

01:21:18.090 --> 01:21:21.220
all sorts of costly stuff
like that, and eventually,

01:21:21.220 --> 01:21:27.630
what you see is the
curves don't do that.

01:21:27.630 --> 01:21:29.640
But at some point,
the cumulative amount

01:21:29.640 --> 01:21:31.830
of calories that the
male has expended

01:21:31.830 --> 01:21:33.450
is greater than the female.

01:21:33.450 --> 01:21:36.240
That's when you see
that cuckoldry business.

01:21:36.240 --> 01:21:38.510
That's where females
will potentially

01:21:38.510 --> 01:21:42.120
pick up and abandon, and because
the male has made the greater

01:21:42.120 --> 01:21:45.430
investment at that point, that
is seen very frequently in bird

01:21:45.430 --> 01:21:47.250
species with pair bonding.

01:21:47.250 --> 01:21:49.850
So we've got here an
exception to the argument

01:21:49.850 --> 01:21:53.230
that the cost of reproduction
and child raising

01:21:53.230 --> 01:21:55.490
is always greater for females
and, thus, will always

01:21:55.490 --> 01:21:58.530
produce greater female
pickiness for mates

01:21:58.530 --> 01:21:59.850
than you find in males.

01:21:59.850 --> 01:22:03.840
Nonetheless, you see
that an awful lot.

01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:05.170
What else do you see?

01:22:05.170 --> 01:22:07.590
A whole world not only
of female pickiness,

01:22:07.590 --> 01:22:10.000
but a whole world
of male attempts

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.940
to control female
reproductive behavior.

01:22:12.940 --> 01:22:16.100
And this found in species
after species after species

01:22:16.100 --> 01:22:18.420
an obvious interpretation
there in terms

01:22:18.420 --> 01:22:21.370
of male-male
competition decreasing

01:22:21.370 --> 01:22:24.550
the ability of females to
mate with someone else.

01:22:24.550 --> 01:22:27.570
And that ranges
from primates who

01:22:27.570 --> 01:22:31.230
are in consortships, where
the male will do what is often

01:22:31.230 --> 01:22:33.910
termed mate guarding,
which is he tries

01:22:33.910 --> 01:22:36.390
to keep the female from
going near any other guy

01:22:36.390 --> 01:22:38.720
to all sorts of
other stuff as well.

01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:41.030
And you certainly see
this in the human realm.

01:22:41.030 --> 01:22:44.610
What are two cultural inventions
humans have come up with

01:22:44.610 --> 01:22:48.970
to decrease the likelihood--
by men-- to decrease

01:22:48.970 --> 01:22:51.580
the likelihood of women
being sexually active

01:22:51.580 --> 01:22:53.520
outside that relationship?

01:22:53.520 --> 01:22:55.770
The first one is
clitoridectomies,

01:22:55.770 --> 01:22:59.120
and something else that serves
a very similar function, which

01:22:59.120 --> 01:23:02.350
is inventions of things
like chastity belts.

01:23:02.350 --> 01:23:03.950
What's up with that?

01:23:03.950 --> 01:23:06.230
What you find are
cultural inventions

01:23:06.230 --> 01:23:10.490
like those in groups that tend
to have occupations where males

01:23:10.490 --> 01:23:12.560
disappear for long periods.

01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:14.980
For example, nomadic
pastoralists,

01:23:14.980 --> 01:23:16.800
where depending on
the time of year,

01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:19.800
you pick up with your camels
or your cows or whatever,

01:23:19.800 --> 01:23:22.150
and you, the guy, are going
to spend the next three

01:23:22.150 --> 01:23:24.930
weeks at the grazing area
that's a good five miles

01:23:24.930 --> 01:23:25.890
west of there.

01:23:25.890 --> 01:23:29.150
And what this is about--
the argument culturally

01:23:29.150 --> 01:23:32.640
for the clitoridectomies is
it decreases female pleasure,

01:23:32.640 --> 01:23:35.990
decreases the likelihood of
her having sex with someone

01:23:35.990 --> 01:23:37.430
else when you were elsewhere.

01:23:37.430 --> 01:23:39.940
What were chastity
belts about when

01:23:39.940 --> 01:23:43.100
the guy picked up and decided to
spend the next six years trying

01:23:43.100 --> 01:23:45.780
to liberate Jerusalem
from the Ottomans

01:23:45.780 --> 01:23:47.640
or whatever off in the Crusades?

01:23:47.640 --> 01:23:51.280
And just so you don't have any
ideas over the next half decade

01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:54.500
while I go die from the plague
somewhere in Eastern Europe,

01:23:54.500 --> 01:23:58.090
that's when those were,
again, a model of cultures

01:23:58.090 --> 01:24:00.040
where there were
extended periods

01:24:00.040 --> 01:24:02.950
of men being away from women.

01:24:02.950 --> 01:24:06.450
You have very often
elaborate cultural inventions

01:24:06.450 --> 01:24:10.030
for men trying to control the
reproductive access of women.

01:24:10.030 --> 01:24:13.030
What that also winds
up doing is explaining

01:24:13.030 --> 01:24:15.740
what was thought to
be the dominant models

01:24:15.740 --> 01:24:18.670
of reproductive success
and reproductive choice

01:24:18.670 --> 01:24:20.370
in all sorts of other species.

01:24:20.370 --> 01:24:22.190
And seen, for
example, in something

01:24:22.190 --> 01:24:26.080
like baboons, what you had
was termed the linear access

01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:27.990
model of reproduction.

01:24:27.990 --> 01:24:29.770
It goes as follows.

01:24:29.770 --> 01:24:31.850
You have a social
group-- for example,

01:24:31.850 --> 01:24:33.410
a baboon social
group-- and there

01:24:33.410 --> 01:24:37.440
is only one female who is in
estrus, only one female who

01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:38.440
is ovulating.

01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:40.210
Who winds up mating with her?

01:24:40.210 --> 01:24:42.580
The alpha male in the troop.

01:24:42.580 --> 01:24:45.920
Now instead, there's two
females who were ovulating.

01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:47.780
Who gets the two females?

01:24:47.780 --> 01:24:49.860
Numbers one and two
in the hierarchy.

01:24:49.860 --> 01:24:53.130
Three females-- numbers one,
two, and three get the female.

01:24:53.130 --> 01:24:56.810
And implicit in that is the
activeness implied in the word

01:24:56.810 --> 01:24:59.250
"get," the passive
lack of choice

01:24:59.250 --> 01:25:00.520
at the female end of things.

01:25:00.520 --> 01:25:03.680
This was the linear access
model in which male dominance

01:25:03.680 --> 01:25:07.780
rank was entirely predictive
of male reproductive success.

01:25:07.780 --> 01:25:10.460
So that's what people
thought lots about then.

01:25:10.460 --> 01:25:13.140
That was the original thinking
about the relationship

01:25:13.140 --> 01:25:16.000
between male dominance rank
and reproductive success.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:20.020
As we will see shortly,
it's not quite so clear.

01:25:20.020 --> 01:25:24.210
Lots of other species, where
you see males attempting

01:25:24.210 --> 01:25:26.130
in the evolutionary
sense, attempting

01:25:26.130 --> 01:25:28.840
to limit female access
to other males--

01:25:28.840 --> 01:25:32.210
this is the whole world
of copulatory plugs.

01:25:32.210 --> 01:25:36.940
Lots of dog canine related
species, where a semen plug is

01:25:36.940 --> 01:25:39.280
left there in the vagina
of the female, which

01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:43.720
soon hardens into a
plug like nothing else

01:25:43.720 --> 01:25:44.920
is happening there.

01:25:44.920 --> 01:25:46.220
You see that.

01:25:46.220 --> 01:25:47.610
There are other cases.

01:25:47.610 --> 01:25:51.780
There are fly species where
the males penis is barbed,

01:25:51.780 --> 01:25:59.261
and ooh, I heard a--
I'm not drawing that.

01:25:59.261 --> 01:26:01.370
What are you thinking?

01:26:01.370 --> 01:26:03.570
Where it's barbed and
where the barbs, in fact,

01:26:03.570 --> 01:26:07.820
go in the opposite direction,
point back at the male.

01:26:07.820 --> 01:26:11.930
Once you get the penis in there,
and it's not coming out again.

01:26:11.930 --> 01:26:15.200
It's like one of
those-- you put your--

01:26:15.200 --> 01:26:17.160
[LAUGHTER]

01:26:17.160 --> 01:26:19.390
Well, it's actually
not like one of those,

01:26:19.390 --> 01:26:20.710
but you get the point.

01:26:20.710 --> 01:26:22.110
And what's that about?

01:26:22.110 --> 01:26:24.800
The male leaves
his penis in there,

01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:27.220
which he manages to
do without afterward,

01:26:27.220 --> 01:26:29.050
because they can make new ones.

01:26:29.050 --> 01:26:31.590
And this is a very different
world you've got here.

01:26:31.590 --> 01:26:34.750
Then you've got the whole world
we've already heard about about

01:26:34.750 --> 01:26:39.490
sperm competition, of sperm from
one male in various fly species

01:26:39.490 --> 01:26:43.100
containing toxins that will
kill the sperm of another male.

01:26:43.100 --> 01:26:45.720
Then there's a whole
interesting world

01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:50.260
that goes on, which is when
males mate with a female,

01:26:50.260 --> 01:26:52.730
they do something
biochemically, which

01:26:52.730 --> 01:26:55.320
decreases the sexual
attractiveness

01:26:55.320 --> 01:26:57.470
of the female
subsequent to that.

01:26:57.470 --> 01:27:00.330
In a number of fly
species, males with mating

01:27:00.330 --> 01:27:03.920
release a chemical, which
decreases mating pheromone

01:27:03.920 --> 01:27:05.440
production in the female.

01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:08.650
And suddenly, nobody else
is interested in her,

01:27:08.650 --> 01:27:11.180
or there are other
flies species where

01:27:11.180 --> 01:27:14.950
males release a chemical, which
decreases sexual proceptivity

01:27:14.950 --> 01:27:15.980
in the female.

01:27:15.980 --> 01:27:19.550
Viciously clever ways
for males to control

01:27:19.550 --> 01:27:22.580
female reproductive
behavior after they've left.

01:27:22.580 --> 01:27:25.660
Male-male competitive
strategies.

01:27:25.660 --> 01:27:28.000
So what do you see at
the female end of things?

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:31.380
No surprise, you see
female counterstrategies.

01:27:31.380 --> 01:27:34.450
One brilliant one
that evolved in humans

01:27:34.450 --> 01:27:39.480
is this relatively unique human
phenomenon of hidden ovulation.

01:27:39.480 --> 01:27:42.380
Yes, all that pheromone
stuff and smelling people's

01:27:42.380 --> 01:27:45.280
armpits and things that don't
happen much in the real world,

01:27:45.280 --> 01:27:48.510
but what you see for the most
part is that humans are not

01:27:48.510 --> 01:27:51.400
terribly aware of where
somebody is in their cycle.

01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:54.560
Humans have invented
hidden ovulation.

01:27:54.560 --> 01:27:56.380
What's that meant to do?

01:27:56.380 --> 01:27:59.410
Decrease paternity certainty.

01:27:59.410 --> 01:28:02.250
And one argument is
that's a good mechanism

01:28:02.250 --> 01:28:05.590
for decreasing the likelihood
of competitive infanticide.

01:28:05.590 --> 01:28:08.420
The other is it
decreases male attempt

01:28:08.420 --> 01:28:10.620
to control female
sexual behavior,

01:28:10.620 --> 01:28:14.060
because it's less clear when
you need to be doing that.

01:28:14.060 --> 01:28:15.640
So counterstrategies.

01:28:15.640 --> 01:28:19.560
More examples-- this is argued
that in some species that

01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:22.310
have non-reproductive sex
throughout the cycle, that

01:28:22.310 --> 01:28:26.160
is a female counterstrategy
to, again, fool the male when

01:28:26.160 --> 01:28:29.730
ovulation is actually occurring,
increasing the likelihood that

01:28:29.730 --> 01:28:32.680
at such times, she can
get somebody else's genes.

01:28:32.680 --> 01:28:36.300
Other strategies-- we've already
heard about one-- [INAUDIBLE]

01:28:36.300 --> 01:28:38.430
in the competitive
infanticide one, which

01:28:38.430 --> 01:28:42.820
is that whole world of females
that can fake being in estrus,

01:28:42.820 --> 01:28:45.590
that go through pseudo
estrus, all of this

01:28:45.590 --> 01:28:49.390
meant to be ways of keeping
males a little bit less certain

01:28:49.390 --> 01:28:53.320
of when they should be trying
to control female sexual access,

01:28:53.320 --> 01:28:56.800
and thus, she has more
choice in the matter.

01:28:56.800 --> 01:29:00.820
What that brings
us to is thus-- oh,

01:29:00.820 --> 01:29:02.730
that's something
interesting that I left out.

01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:07.450
Eh, it's not that interesting.

01:29:07.450 --> 01:29:08.580
OK.

01:29:08.580 --> 01:29:10.870
So back to male-male
competition.

01:29:10.870 --> 01:29:13.920
This was first looking at
male in lots of species,

01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:17.010
male attempts to regulate
female sexual behavior,

01:29:17.010 --> 01:29:18.680
female counterstrategies.

01:29:18.680 --> 01:29:20.780
What's up with
male-male competition

01:29:20.780 --> 01:29:23.000
in terms of evolution
and sexual behavior?

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:26.190
Most obvious one being
is male-male competition

01:29:26.190 --> 01:29:29.130
for reproductive access
and the standard old models

01:29:29.130 --> 01:29:32.170
being that linear access model--
one female winds up with number

01:29:32.170 --> 01:29:34.300
one male, two, and so on.

01:29:34.300 --> 01:29:36.470
What that thus
begins to explain is

01:29:36.470 --> 01:29:39.620
when you look at all
social species out there,

01:29:39.620 --> 01:29:42.660
the leading cause of aggression
is male-male aggression

01:29:42.660 --> 01:29:44.540
built around female access.

01:29:44.540 --> 01:29:46.320
And as we'll see
by next week, that

01:29:46.320 --> 01:29:50.060
is the case as well for every
human culture ever looked at.

01:29:50.060 --> 01:29:53.400
You also see, of course,
the sperm competition.

01:29:53.400 --> 01:29:55.580
And once again, we have
one of those issues

01:29:55.580 --> 01:29:59.330
with humans, which is where do
we fit on the spectrum there?

01:29:59.330 --> 01:30:02.360
If you have a
monogamous species,

01:30:02.360 --> 01:30:06.010
males tend to produce only
small amounts of sperm

01:30:06.010 --> 01:30:07.840
and tend to have small testes.

01:30:07.840 --> 01:30:09.800
When you have
polygamous species,

01:30:09.800 --> 01:30:12.790
males want to pump out
insane amounts of sperm

01:30:12.790 --> 01:30:15.890
to increase the likelihood of
outcompeting some other guy's

01:30:15.890 --> 01:30:17.790
sperm if it shows
up on the scene

01:30:17.790 --> 01:30:22.270
or for making a sperm plug, and
what you wind up getting there

01:30:22.270 --> 01:30:24.670
in those species
are large testes.

01:30:24.670 --> 01:30:26.220
So you look at the
various primates,

01:30:26.220 --> 01:30:29.700
and chimps have gigantic
testicles per body size.

01:30:29.700 --> 01:30:30.822
Gorillas do not.

01:30:30.822 --> 01:30:32.530
Gorillas that have a
very different world

01:30:32.530 --> 01:30:34.900
of male-male com--
what about humans?

01:30:34.900 --> 01:30:37.190
Once again, the
same exact thing.

01:30:37.190 --> 01:30:39.480
We are about halfway in between.

01:30:39.480 --> 01:30:41.650
When compared to
other primates, we

01:30:41.650 --> 01:30:44.340
are intermediate between a
tournament species and a pair

01:30:44.340 --> 01:30:47.210
bonding species in
yet another domain.

01:30:47.210 --> 01:30:50.120
We've been hearing about
this again and again.

01:30:50.120 --> 01:30:52.080
Something really
interesting that has

01:30:52.080 --> 01:30:56.770
been shown in humans, which is--
no, I'm not going to tell that.

01:30:56.770 --> 01:30:58.160
That's too hard to explain.

01:30:58.160 --> 01:30:59.220
But it was great.

01:30:59.220 --> 01:31:03.120
You would really wish-- so
now what we have is also

01:31:03.120 --> 01:31:07.610
looking at evolutionary aspects
of female choice in there,

01:31:07.610 --> 01:31:11.660
and in what cases do you get
female-female competition?

01:31:11.660 --> 01:31:14.200
First off, the answer
was obvious in terms

01:31:14.200 --> 01:31:16.980
of looking at traditional
tournament species, which

01:31:16.980 --> 01:31:19.610
is that females have no choice
who they are mating with.

01:31:19.610 --> 01:31:21.550
It's linear access models.

01:31:21.550 --> 01:31:24.160
One female winds up with
the alpha male, two females

01:31:24.160 --> 01:31:26.870
and so on, and this
was the dominant model

01:31:26.870 --> 01:31:30.320
in all of primatology
starting in the '60s.

01:31:30.320 --> 01:31:33.240
And then by around
1980 or so, it

01:31:33.240 --> 01:31:34.960
was recognized that,
in fact, there's

01:31:34.960 --> 01:31:37.810
virtually no evidence
for strict linear access

01:31:37.810 --> 01:31:42.690
models of the main determinant
of who a female mates with is

01:31:42.690 --> 01:31:45.860
who's the winner of male-male
competitive interactions.

01:31:45.860 --> 01:31:48.840
People discovered at the
time that, in fact, there

01:31:48.840 --> 01:31:53.111
was this strange, strange
violation of all these models,

01:31:53.111 --> 01:31:55.610
because it turned out the models
were not based on behavior.

01:31:55.610 --> 01:31:58.220
And this generally was
discovered around that time,

01:31:58.220 --> 01:32:00.420
because that was around
the time that the majority

01:32:00.420 --> 01:32:02.530
of primatologists on
earth suddenly became

01:32:02.530 --> 01:32:05.940
female and started looking
at the female end of things

01:32:05.940 --> 01:32:09.550
and discovered that this
linear access stuff is not,

01:32:09.550 --> 01:32:11.200
in fact, what occurs.

01:32:11.200 --> 01:32:15.630
And out of that came a
completely shocking concept

01:32:15.630 --> 01:32:19.520
that ran through primatology
like a bolt of lightning--

01:32:19.520 --> 01:32:22.300
the notion that there was--
this is the technical term--

01:32:22.300 --> 01:32:25.520
some degree of female choice.

01:32:25.520 --> 01:32:27.470
Oh, whoa.

01:32:27.470 --> 01:32:31.880
That's kind of bizarre,
where females have something

01:32:31.880 --> 01:32:33.220
to do with who they mate with.

01:32:33.220 --> 01:32:35.800
And there's been a whole
world of primatology studies

01:32:35.800 --> 01:32:39.140
since then showing what
female choice is about.

01:32:39.140 --> 01:32:41.700
First off, how
does female choice

01:32:41.700 --> 01:32:44.920
occur in a typical
tournament species?

01:32:44.920 --> 01:32:46.190
You've got this problem.

01:32:46.190 --> 01:32:49.710
With primates, for example,
you wind up with a pair bond,

01:32:49.710 --> 01:32:53.380
with a consortship between a
male and an ovulating female,

01:32:53.380 --> 01:32:55.330
and because it's a
tournament species,

01:32:55.330 --> 01:32:57.850
the male is twice
the size or has

01:32:57.850 --> 01:33:01.570
big huge canines or whatever
stuff he's got there.

01:33:01.570 --> 01:33:04.080
He is physically able
to dominate the female

01:33:04.080 --> 01:33:05.190
quite readily.

01:33:05.190 --> 01:33:08.830
You do not see female choice
in those cases being exerted

01:33:08.830 --> 01:33:10.590
by the female
beating up on the guy

01:33:10.590 --> 01:33:13.050
and her getting to go mate
with who she's interested in.

01:33:13.050 --> 01:33:16.290
What you see is much
more clever behavior

01:33:16.290 --> 01:33:17.900
on the part of the female.

01:33:17.900 --> 01:33:21.120
She will, for example,
exhaust the guy.

01:33:21.120 --> 01:33:23.670
Every time he sits down
to feed, the female

01:33:23.670 --> 01:33:25.060
gets up and starts walking.

01:33:25.060 --> 01:33:28.449
And he has to jump up and
pile together the picnic

01:33:28.449 --> 01:33:29.490
and go running after her.

01:33:29.490 --> 01:33:32.180
Every time he tries to take
a nap, she goes walking.

01:33:32.180 --> 01:33:35.420
Or what you find with baboons
is the most clever thing

01:33:35.420 --> 01:33:39.480
that females do is they go
walk and leave the male right

01:33:39.480 --> 01:33:42.410
in front of his
worst rival, or then

01:33:42.410 --> 01:33:44.480
they'll do it again
and again and again

01:33:44.480 --> 01:33:47.040
and get the guy totally
harried out and crazed,

01:33:47.040 --> 01:33:49.850
and at some point, those
two males will have a fight.

01:33:49.850 --> 01:33:52.750
And what then happens is
she runs off to the bushes

01:33:52.750 --> 01:33:54.430
and has what is
technically called

01:33:54.430 --> 01:33:58.555
a stolen copulation with the guy
she's actually interested in.

01:34:01.060 --> 01:34:04.060
Maybe it's not so bad
to be a female baboon.

01:34:04.060 --> 01:34:06.510
So now what this
brings us to insofar

01:34:06.510 --> 01:34:10.140
as this alternative female
strategy is available,

01:34:10.140 --> 01:34:13.380
we now come to this
absolutely critical question,

01:34:13.380 --> 01:34:15.590
one that is run through
the ages, which is,

01:34:15.590 --> 01:34:18.300
what do female baboons want?

01:34:18.300 --> 01:34:19.850
Who do they want to mate with?

01:34:19.850 --> 01:34:23.260
And people are not
positive, but there

01:34:23.260 --> 01:34:25.690
is some suggestion in the data.

01:34:25.690 --> 01:34:27.500
It needs to be replicated more.

01:34:27.500 --> 01:34:30.360
There is this trend, but
there's this suggestion

01:34:30.360 --> 01:34:34.420
that female baboons like to
mate with male baboons, who

01:34:34.420 --> 01:34:36.680
are nice to them.

01:34:36.680 --> 01:34:38.130
No, are they sure?

01:34:38.130 --> 01:34:38.900
Are they certain?

01:34:38.900 --> 01:34:41.180
Have they done their
statistics right?

01:34:41.180 --> 01:34:45.480
They go, and they mate with
guys who groom them a lot,

01:34:45.480 --> 01:34:47.430
guys who play with
their infants,

01:34:47.430 --> 01:34:50.060
guys who, when they're in a
bad mood, don't beat up on them

01:34:50.060 --> 01:34:51.570
but beat up on somebody else.

01:34:51.570 --> 01:34:54.200
This counts as a prince
of the male baboon.

01:34:54.200 --> 01:34:56.170
This is someone you
take home to meet mom.

01:34:56.170 --> 01:34:59.280
When he's in a bad mood, he
pummels someone else, not me.

01:34:59.280 --> 01:35:02.040
This is someone you
want to mate with.

01:35:02.040 --> 01:35:05.710
And in the mid 1980s, excellent
primatologist Barbara Smuts

01:35:05.710 --> 01:35:07.550
of University of
Michigan came up

01:35:07.550 --> 01:35:10.130
with the very jargony
scientific term

01:35:10.130 --> 01:35:11.900
that all sorts of
non-human primates

01:35:11.900 --> 01:35:14.110
have intersexual friendships.

01:35:14.110 --> 01:35:17.240
And that's not an
anthropomorphic term.

01:35:17.240 --> 01:35:19.050
What it was though
was people sort

01:35:19.050 --> 01:35:21.840
of snickering at it in
that the initial notion was

01:35:21.840 --> 01:35:23.720
that these were just friends.

01:35:23.720 --> 01:35:26.290
These were platonic
monkey relationships.

01:35:26.290 --> 01:35:27.930
They were not
about reproduction,

01:35:27.930 --> 01:35:30.880
and it was not until people
got good enough and enough data

01:35:30.880 --> 01:35:33.640
to start picking up on all
those stolen copulations

01:35:33.640 --> 01:35:35.860
to see that the
females were picking up

01:35:35.860 --> 01:35:38.907
and mating with their nice
guy-- oh, we're just friends.

01:35:38.907 --> 01:35:40.990
I could never see him--
whoa, and they're suddenly

01:35:40.990 --> 01:35:42.140
in the bushes with him.

01:35:42.140 --> 01:35:46.067
And it suddenly turned from the,
yeah, nice guys finish last.

01:35:46.067 --> 01:35:48.400
OK, they do lots of grooming,
but let's count the number

01:35:48.400 --> 01:35:50.800
of copies of genes,
to becoming apparent

01:35:50.800 --> 01:35:55.540
that the being a nice guy was a
viable alternative reproductive

01:35:55.540 --> 01:35:59.390
strategy as long as there was
this thing of female choice.

01:35:59.390 --> 01:36:01.770
And what the paternity
studies began to show

01:36:01.770 --> 01:36:05.970
was that was a very viable
alternative strategy, in part,

01:36:05.970 --> 01:36:07.950
because you're not
mating anywhere near as

01:36:07.950 --> 01:36:11.300
much if you were a low
ranking affiliative male.

01:36:11.300 --> 01:36:14.320
With a female, you're not
mating anywhere near as much

01:36:14.320 --> 01:36:17.860
as the high ranking males,
but you're not burning out.

01:36:17.860 --> 01:36:19.030
You're not getting injured.

01:36:19.030 --> 01:36:20.970
You're not having the
male-male fighting.

01:36:20.970 --> 01:36:24.900
You live a lot longer,
and this keeps happening.

01:36:24.900 --> 01:36:27.260
There's a problem,
though, which is

01:36:27.260 --> 01:36:30.410
suppose you are a
female baboon, and you

01:36:30.410 --> 01:36:32.284
want to mate with
this nice guy, and one

01:36:32.284 --> 01:36:33.700
of the things that
he's nice about

01:36:33.700 --> 01:36:35.340
is he's nice to
your kid, who's now

01:36:35.340 --> 01:36:37.380
about three or four years old.

01:36:37.380 --> 01:36:39.137
And there's a very
good chance that where

01:36:39.137 --> 01:36:41.000
that affiliative
relationship started

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.640
with him got jump started was
the fact that he was the most

01:36:43.640 --> 01:36:47.170
likely father of that kid
and has developed somewhat

01:36:47.170 --> 01:36:48.972
of an affiliative
relationship with the kid

01:36:48.972 --> 01:36:50.930
and hangs out with them
and hangs out with you.

01:36:50.930 --> 01:36:52.490
And so you've
established this is

01:36:52.490 --> 01:36:54.270
a nice guy I want to mate with.

01:36:54.270 --> 01:36:56.660
But there's a problem,
which was if he

01:36:56.660 --> 01:36:58.410
was the likely
father of your now

01:36:58.410 --> 01:37:00.900
three, four-year-old
offspring, the odds

01:37:00.900 --> 01:37:02.830
are that three,
four years ago, he

01:37:02.830 --> 01:37:05.440
was a pretty high ranking male.

01:37:05.440 --> 01:37:07.750
And what that means now
three, four years later

01:37:07.750 --> 01:37:11.890
is he's likely to be some
aging guy over the hill, whose

01:37:11.890 --> 01:37:13.600
rank has been dropping.

01:37:13.600 --> 01:37:15.690
In other words,
not someone who is

01:37:15.690 --> 01:37:18.640
going to be very effective
at male-male competition,

01:37:18.640 --> 01:37:21.920
and you get this
horrible sort of tension

01:37:21.920 --> 01:37:25.140
there going on between the
male-male competitive world

01:37:25.140 --> 01:37:28.204
generates some Arnold
Schwarzenegger jerk,

01:37:28.204 --> 01:37:30.620
who's the one who's supposed
to be where she wants to mate

01:37:30.620 --> 01:37:32.650
with Alan Alda or whoever.

01:37:32.650 --> 01:37:35.080
And what you have
then is he's not

01:37:35.080 --> 01:37:37.210
up to the male-male
competitive stuff,

01:37:37.210 --> 01:37:38.940
because he's some aging guy.

01:37:38.940 --> 01:37:43.410
And you instead have the
world of stolen copulations.

01:37:43.410 --> 01:37:44.790
So isn't that great?

01:37:44.790 --> 01:37:45.990
Isn't that heartwarming?

01:37:45.990 --> 01:37:49.850
A whole world of what are now
called alternative strategies.

01:37:49.850 --> 01:37:52.780
If you're some scheming
male baboon wanting

01:37:52.780 --> 01:37:55.000
to pass on as many
copies of your genes,

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.560
you may decide the
really manipulative thing

01:37:57.560 --> 01:37:59.990
to do is to be
nice to some female

01:37:59.990 --> 01:38:02.780
and groom her more
than she grooms

01:38:02.780 --> 01:38:05.780
you, which is a very rare
thing for a male baboon to do.

01:38:05.780 --> 01:38:10.250
So great alternative
strategies, very heartwarming.

01:38:10.250 --> 01:38:12.910
Not so heartwarming,
because there

01:38:12.910 --> 01:38:17.370
are other alternative strategies
available in some species,

01:38:17.370 --> 01:38:21.010
alternatives where male
sexual behavior is not

01:38:21.010 --> 01:38:24.130
the outcome of explicit
male-male competition,

01:38:24.130 --> 01:38:26.680
but instead takes an
alternative strategy.

01:38:26.680 --> 01:38:30.940
And you see one example
of this in orangutans.

01:38:30.940 --> 01:38:33.460
Orangutans, great
apes, and they've

01:38:33.460 --> 01:38:36.710
got a very interesting bizarre
social system, but what

01:38:36.710 --> 01:38:39.920
you have is your basic,
nonetheless, sort of familiar

01:38:39.920 --> 01:38:43.870
picture of male-male competition
with a large percentage

01:38:43.870 --> 01:38:45.680
of orangutan male
aggressions built

01:38:45.680 --> 01:38:47.780
around the reproductive
access to females,

01:38:47.780 --> 01:38:50.730
and you've got a whole
world of very peripheralized

01:38:50.730 --> 01:38:53.499
low ranking males
who never mate.

01:38:53.499 --> 01:38:55.040
And there's an
interesting physiology

01:38:55.040 --> 01:38:56.420
that goes along with it.

01:38:56.420 --> 01:38:59.090
That was the picture that
everybody used to have,

01:38:59.090 --> 01:39:02.980
and then in the 1970s, pioneer
researcher in this, Birute

01:39:02.980 --> 01:39:06.310
Galdikas, who has studied
orangs for decades

01:39:06.310 --> 01:39:09.110
out there in Indonesia,
she noted something

01:39:09.110 --> 01:39:12.550
really disturbing,
which is low ranking,

01:39:12.550 --> 01:39:16.290
non-reproductive male orangs
have an alternative mating

01:39:16.290 --> 01:39:17.110
strategy.

01:39:17.110 --> 01:39:18.220
What do they do?

01:39:18.220 --> 01:39:21.880
They rape females, and this
was the first introduction

01:39:21.880 --> 01:39:24.610
of that term into
zoology, and that is not

01:39:24.610 --> 01:39:26.050
an anthropomorphism.

01:39:26.050 --> 01:39:30.270
If defined as a violent
process of mating

01:39:30.270 --> 01:39:32.450
with a female against
her will, this

01:39:32.450 --> 01:39:34.540
is what goes on in orangutans.

01:39:34.540 --> 01:39:36.960
A certain percentage
of reproduction

01:39:36.960 --> 01:39:40.190
is low ranking guys who
have no direct access

01:39:40.190 --> 01:39:43.110
to females as a result of
male-male interactions.

01:39:43.110 --> 01:39:45.580
This is not the nice
guy alternative,

01:39:45.580 --> 01:39:47.730
so there is precedent
for this also.

01:39:47.730 --> 01:39:50.790
And this is by now very
well-documented behavior

01:39:50.790 --> 01:39:52.820
among orangutans.

01:39:52.820 --> 01:39:54.680
Then if you want to
call it with something

01:39:54.680 --> 01:39:57.390
very subtle and clever,
there's apparently

01:39:57.390 --> 01:39:59.720
this whole world
of fish species,

01:39:59.720 --> 01:40:02.840
where low ranking males
can pretend to be a female

01:40:02.840 --> 01:40:06.090
and take on female coloration
and pretend to be just

01:40:06.090 --> 01:40:08.342
friends and someone they
can pour their heart out to,

01:40:08.342 --> 01:40:10.175
and then suddenly one
day they have a penis,

01:40:10.175 --> 01:40:11.790
and where'd that come from?

01:40:11.790 --> 01:40:13.871
And everything
suddenly changes there.

01:40:13.871 --> 01:40:14.370
OK.

01:40:14.370 --> 01:40:17.170
So we have the very
strict boring models.

01:40:17.170 --> 01:40:19.630
Females invest more
calories than males,

01:40:19.630 --> 01:40:21.600
and, thus, they are
much more picky.

01:40:21.600 --> 01:40:24.050
Males mate with females
entirely as a function

01:40:24.050 --> 01:40:26.190
of male-male competition,
and thus, evolution

01:40:26.190 --> 01:40:29.720
is driven by male
aggression and all of that.

01:40:29.720 --> 01:40:32.070
Let me just see as
people are clearly

01:40:32.070 --> 01:40:33.548
about to run out the door.

01:40:36.340 --> 01:40:39.750

Stanford University.

00:00:07.791 --> 00:00:08.290
--started.

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.900
See some exam-related
announcements.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.190
First off, there are the
statistics, mean and median,

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:21.739
which, in terms of
numbers and what

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:23.280
they mean-- what
they mean in my book

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.130
is that people are doing
a good job in here.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.990
So, good going.

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.830
Also having done an amazing
job are the TAs, who, other

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.500
than coming to
class here, have not

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.470
been allowed out of
the conference room

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:37.680
since you left your
exams with them.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.080
They have screamed with the
repetitiveness of grading

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.510
the same question 550 times.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.940
And they worked really hard
to get this back to you

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.420
guys in time for
decisions about pass,

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.090
no credit-- that sort of thing.

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:57.192
So these guys did yet
another amazing job.

00:00:57.192 --> 00:00:58.160
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERS]

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.128
Yay, TAs.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:03.800
Let's see.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.100
The other thing is, the
exams will be outside,

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.340
at the end of class.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.900
A to M is upstairs, and
the rest of those letters

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.010
are downstairs.

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.886
So start figuring
out which you are.

00:01:17.886 --> 00:01:21.360
The TAs will be flinging boxes
of exams around out there, so

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.520
go get yours afterward.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.720
Again, people did a good job.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.700
OK, picking up on our by now
sickeningly familiar time

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.450
core strategy thing, here,
we left off on Friday,

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.700
way to the left, in our very
last area of sexual behavior

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.490
and the logic there is--
ooh, somewhere along the way

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.710
we mentioned genes,
or we mentioned

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.730
a hormone, or a receptor,
or whatever, and thus

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:49.290
were immediately talking
about the evolution thereof,

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.300
all the way back.

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.550
What does natural
selection theory

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.620
tell us about the evolution
of sexual behavior?

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.410
And what we've been
doing is bouncing

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.100
between the two genders,
in terms of strategies,

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.680
starting off with
the basic asymmetry

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:08.639
of caloric expenditure on sperm
versus an egg plus a pregnancy,

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:11.360
plus, in most species,
raising the offspring.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.780
All of that giving rise
to the famed promiscuity

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.450
on the part of males-- the
lower levels of pickiness.

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.960
What we saw was the role
of male-male competition

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.080
and making sense
of behaviors that

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.550
are involved in passing
on more copies of genes.

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.670
We have also seen all
sorts of male strategies

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.900
for decreasing the reproductive
success of competitors

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.950
and, in the same
process, decreasing

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.880
that of females for the future.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.280
And female counterstrategies
in a lot of those cases.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.190
What we also then
transitioned to

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.840
was what female choice
was about, even in species

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.440
that were tournament species.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.440
And what we transition
to now is looking

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.040
at aspects of
female-female competition,

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.060
in terms of sexual reproduction.

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.500
What you see is--
predominantly in species

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.230
that are pair-bonding,
that are monogamous--

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.860
what you see is the
potential for a great deal

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.460
of female-female competition
for access to males.

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:11.180
That ironic turn
of events where,

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:12.830
if the whole system
works-- where

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.670
you give birth and
the guy who believes

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.806
he's the father is going to
be taken care of the kids,

00:03:17.806 --> 00:03:21.900
and what you want is
someone who is good at that,

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.290
is confident at that, can act
maternal in a convincing way,

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.340
and thus is subject to a
whole lot of competition

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:29.840
on the part of females.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.020
And thus what you get
is selection pressures

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.260
in those species-- New World
monkeys, for example-- a lot

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.420
of bird species--
selection pressures.

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.490
Where, if anything,
it's the females

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:43.930
who wind up being more
aggressive than the males.

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.690
The females who tend
to have the larger body

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.060
size, who have the
more pronounced

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.160
secondary sexual
characteristics.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.530
What's that about?

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:57.280
It's females competing with
females for males to pick them,

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.930
exactly the opposite scenario
as in most of the species

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.950
we've been hearing about.

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:03.860
OK.

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.760
What this then brings us to
is the next great question,

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.820
which already I've
had a lot of people

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.880
ask me during breaks-- all
the way back way there,

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.910
in terms of making
sense of the evolution

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.519
of this type of sexual
behavior and that type

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.470
and the other type, in terms of
passing on copies of your genes

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.178
and you and your
relatives-- all of that.

00:04:22.178 --> 00:04:25.810
Which brings you, inevitably,
to the question of, well, what

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.000
about the evolution
of homosexuality?

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.100
Because this has
always been the puzzle

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.350
in the book of zoologist,
evolutionary biologist,

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.270
et cetera, trying
to make sense of all

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.440
of this in the
context of adaptation

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.430
and passing on copies of
genes, especially when you

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.010
see how widespread this
is in lots and lots

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:47.390
and lots of other species.

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:48.800
What's up with that?

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.260
Because, up until
relatively recent times,

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.870
across virtually every
culture out there,

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.620
gay men had a much fewer
number of copies of genes,

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.980
on the average, that
they were passing on.

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:03.890
How could this trait
to be so universal?

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:08.580
And best estimates are 5% to
20% rate in every human culture

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:09.670
ever looked at.

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:11.610
So what's the
selection for that?

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.520
Or why hasn't that
been selected against?

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.220
Basically, there's
been three theories

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:18.700
that have floated around.

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:22.660
And all of them are predicated
on one very simple fact that

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.830
still is not all
that factual, which

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:28.290
is that there is a
genetic component to one's

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:29.790
sexual orientation.

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:32.480
And we already heard all
sorts of bits of evidence

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.840
about prenatal endocrine
environment that

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.550
argues in other directions.

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:40.020
We have already heard that there
have been those studies which

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:43.940
find covariance of
sexual orientation

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.700
in identical twins
versus nonidentical--

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:49.460
finding a genetic marker,
but one that nobody else

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:50.730
is able to replicate.

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:53.460
So everything now is
predicated on the notion

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.310
that, well, genes have at
least a little bit of something

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:57.730
to do with it.

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:00.170
So, three theories that
have floated around,

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:04.780
first one being the
heterozygotic-vigor argument.

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:06.470
Lots of folks will
recognize that

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:08.080
from other realms of genetics.

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.420
That's the deal where you
can have certain traits which

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:16.810
can be in the homozygotic form
or in the heterozygotic form.

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:18.900
And people who are
new to this, go back

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:22.420
and check your notes from
the Mendel genetics catch-up

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:23.170
sections.

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:26.300
And what you see is,
with lots of diseases

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.820
you get an extreme version
is indeed a disease

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:33.830
and a partial version
is, in fact, adaptive.

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:37.540
And the classic example
that always gets trotted out

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:41.390
is sickle-cell anemia--
full-blown homozygotic version,

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:46.350
horrible hematological disorder;
partial, heterozygotic version,

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:51.100
resistance to malaria and a
gazillion diseases out there.

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:52.610
And what's done
is metaphorically

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:56.610
running the same argument of
saying, whatever gene genes are

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:59.870
relevant, maybe the
homozygotic form

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:03.770
is the one that produces a
behavioral phenotype which

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:06.150
decreases reproductive success.

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:08.500
But there's some
heterozygotic form

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:14.010
which has some huge advantage
and enough of one to outweigh

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:16.830
the one-fourth of the
relatives who wind up

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:18.700
with the homozygotic version.

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:22.510
So that's one model, for which
there is very little evidence.

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:23.840
Next one.

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:29.720
Next one is a gender-dependent
genetic argument, as follows.

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:31.040
It is a trait.

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.840
It is a genetically
influenced trait

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:36.790
which, when expressed
in one gender,

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:40.870
is maladaptive and decreases
reproductive success.

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:43.210
But when it is expressed
in the other gender,

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:47.130
it is highly adaptive and
increases reproductive success.

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:50.650
And you can immediately run
your numbers argument there

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:54.440
that, as long as the benefits
for the other kind of sibling

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:57.600
or gender is larger
than the detriment here,

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:59.530
this is going to
be selected for.

00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:00.850
What would that look like?

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:02.880
Where is the evidence for that?

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:07.210
What one would predict is that
you would see, for gay men,

00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:10.230
that their sisters have
a higher-than-average

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:11.710
reproductive rate.

00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:14.900
And that is absolutely
there in the literature.

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:17.440
So the people who push
for this view would say,

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:21.180
aha, there is some sort
of trait which, in a male,

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:25.240
increases the likelihood,
manifesting as homosexuality

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:28.260
in a female, as some
route by which there is

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.210
increased reproductive success.

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:34.080
The third model is the
"helper at the nest" model,

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:38.890
which is that the individual
who traditionally is not

00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:40.710
passing on copies
of their own genes

00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:42.919
directly-- instead,
what they're doing

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:46.790
is expending resources on
helping their siblings.

00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:49.820
OK, so that kind of sounds
like the second model, also.

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:51.110
What's the difference?

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:55.080
The second model says
that sisters of gay men

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.420
should have increased
reproductive rates.

00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:59.700
What the third model--
the "helping at the nest"

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:03.300
model-- suggests is,
both sisters and brothers

00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:05.530
should have increased
reproductive rates.

00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:08.370
And that's actually
what's mostly been seen.

00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:12.520
So, support for this "helper
at the nest" kin-selection

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:13.890
kind of argument.

00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:14.570
OK.

00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:18.950
What else does one look
for in a mate, besides all

00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:20.960
of the stuff that males
are competing about

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:23.330
and females in
pair-bonding species?

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:25.180
What are some of the
characteristics that

00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:28.210
pop up over and over again,
when it's getting around

00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:32.690
to who looks good to you, if
you are a damselfly trying

00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:35.360
to pick out a mate, and in
all these other species?

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:37.930
One initial
characteristic, which

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:43.100
is the famed role of facial
symmetry in attractiveness.

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:46.340
This has an interesting
history, and this goes back

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:47.710
to the 19th century.

00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:51.460
And there was some
guy-- who was it?

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:52.830
It was Francis Galton.

00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:53.330
Was it?

00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:56.850
Maybe.

00:09:56.850 --> 00:09:58.850
And it was Francis
Galton, I think,

00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:01.420
who was having--
no, it couldn't be.

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:04.054
They didn't have-- forget that.

00:10:04.054 --> 00:10:04.970
Don't write that down.

00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:07.570
There was some guy in
the 19th century who

00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:14.150
was a famous criminologist and
was pushing a classic nonsense

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:17.840
theory of the time, which is
that there is a criminal face

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:22.260
and that people who are really
skilled police people could

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.200
to look at somebody's face
beforehand and immediately

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:27.640
predict that this is
someone who is going

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:29.600
to commit a criminal
act, inevitably,

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:32.150
at some-- all sorts of nonsense.

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:36.630
Genetic determinism and
racism and [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:39.160
biases of all sorts
running through there.

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:42.310
Complete nonsense-- yet one
of the dominant intellectual

00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:44.890
models in criminology
in the 19th century

00:10:44.890 --> 00:10:47.910
was that there are facial
characteristics that

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:50.720
are typical of criminals.

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:54.340
So this was this individual
who decided to come up

00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:57.810
with the archetypal face of
what a criminal looks like

00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:00.740
and managed to get photographs
of the faces of a whole bunch

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:04.140
of different criminals,
pulling them out of the jail

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:07.630
or whatever and taking a picture
with the newly invented camera.

00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:12.410
And, through some technique that
clearly was some proto Adobe

00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:14.920
Photoshop sort of
ancestor thing,

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:18.660
was able to overlap the
faces in order to come up

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:20.120
with a composite face.

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:23.430
And this composite face
was now going to tell you,

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:26.040
this is the most
criminal-looking face

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:28.150
that anybody has ever seen.

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:29.650
And that's not what happened.

00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:31.720
Instead, everybody
looked at that face

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:34.670
and said, hey, that guy's
kind of good-looking!

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:37.100
That guy is, in fact,
really good-looking.

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:40.400
And had just stumbled on
this interesting thing that,

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:45.180
when you average faces, when
you toss them all together,

00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:48.200
that when you merge
them, they look

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:50.190
more attractive
than the individuals

00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:54.270
that they came from-- when
you make composite pictures.

00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:59.960
And this has kept all sorts of
people happy doing experiments

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:03.320
where they do mixes and
matches of starting with 100

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:06.870
different pictures of people
and combine subsets of them

00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:09.420
and having people rating
attractiveness and stuff.

00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:12.360
And it's this absolutely
bizarre thing--

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:15.490
that the more faces that go
into a composite, the more,

00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:18.760
on the average, people perceive
them as being attractive,

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:21.700
amid incredibly
subtle differences

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:25.910
between a composite picture
of 50 faces versus 25,

00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:29.760
all of that, people are able to
pick up the differences-- not

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:31.490
necessarily consciously.

00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:33.530
So what is that about?

00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:38.254
And what became clear,
many decades later,

00:12:38.254 --> 00:12:39.670
is that what happens
when you make

00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:42.340
a lot of faces all
into one composite

00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:46.350
is you get a highly
symmetrical face.

00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:49.810
And this seems to be the
key thing that comes through

00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:51.720
in that realm of attractiveness.

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:55.580
Which is that, when you average
in a whole lot of faces,

00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:59.330
one of the things you average
is the averageness of the face.

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:01.250
And you get rid of asymmetries.

00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:06.620
And everyone knows that-- who
would you want to mate with?

00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:07.120
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:10.460
OK, so, thereby
proving the point.

00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:14.500
And what you've got is,
symmetry is apparently

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:16.720
a good, reliable
marker of health.

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:20.070
Wildly asymmetric
faces are typically

00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:23.820
the result of complications--
developmental ones-- health

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:24.780
sort of issues.

00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:28.630
So the general interpretation
is that symmetry is attractive

00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:31.790
because it is a
marker of health.

00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:34.760
And every single
article you will ever

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:36.987
read in sort of the
lay press-- or even

00:13:36.987 --> 00:13:38.570
in some of the science
journals, which

00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:40.070
should be above
this sort of thing--

00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:43.580
will have the picture of some
famously attractive somebody

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:45.340
or other, with
the face up there,

00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:47.950
and all the little caliper
markings, and showing

00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:51.760
the same sizes, and then
some poor schnook who's

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:56.170
chosen to be the asymmetric
face who's stuck up there.

00:13:56.170 --> 00:14:00.420
Did the Newsweek article wind
up being in the readings?

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:02.380
No, it wasn't-- yes.

00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:03.530
OK.

00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:05.670
Lyle Lovett-- is that
the face they had there

00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:08.630
that they were making vicious
fun of and pointing out

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:10.540
lip asymmetries and such?

00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:15.730
Something about the symmetry
seems to be a marker for health

00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:17.390
and is considered
more attractive.

00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:20.720
And people can pick up
astonishingly subtle

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:22.620
asymmetries in faces.

00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:26.240
Babies, at two
months of age, show--

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:28.680
when you are doing
morphed faces,

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:33.350
composite faces, where you
can very minorly adjust

00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:36.750
the degree of symmetry or
asymmetry in the face-- babies,

00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:39.030
at two months of
age, are already

00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:43.500
preferring to look at pictures
of more symmetrical faces.

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:46.730
You find this in lots of
other species, as well.

00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:50.040
When you look at
animals lever-pressing--

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:51.830
rats, for example,
getting access

00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:54.530
to other rats of
the opposite gender.

00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:57.380
And you will see there's
a bias for symmetry there.

00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:59.470
There is a bias in
nonhuman primates

00:14:59.470 --> 00:15:01.290
for more symmetrical faces.

00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:03.480
How's this for a
nutty study that

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:07.380
was published about five
years ago, in Nature?

00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:11.290
And this one reported that
people who had symmetrical

00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:15.200
faces were better dancers.

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:17.450
OK, let's work through that one.

00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:19.090
What was that one about?

00:15:19.090 --> 00:15:23.090
And they did-- it
was a bizarre study,

00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:26.050
but somehow, nonetheless,
it was irresistible.

00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:27.070
Here's what they showed.

00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:30.030
They filmed all sorts
of people dancing.

00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:32.380
And, no doubt, they
did perfect controls

00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:34.540
and they, like,
made sure everybody

00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:36.570
danced to the same
thing, which was,

00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:40.660
like-- oh, I don't
know-- something--

00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:43.390
a scientist rapping
to something or other.

00:15:43.390 --> 00:15:45.090
And people dancing away, there.

00:15:45.090 --> 00:15:47.729
And then they used
this amazing technique,

00:15:47.729 --> 00:15:49.520
which I didn't understand
in the slightest,

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:52.960
with some sort of
camera-capture technique

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:55.780
that would make everybody
dancing look like Gumby.

00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:59.080
So you took out all the
individual features-- anything

00:15:59.080 --> 00:15:59.600
at all.

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:01.600
And people would then
rate them on the dancing.

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:03.350
And it would turn
out that people

00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:06.320
who were rated by both
genders, of either gender,

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:08.630
as being a better
dancer, when you then

00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:10.860
went and checked out
their faces afterward,

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:14.950
with your slide rule, turned out
to have more symmetrical faces.

00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:15.790
Whoa!

00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:17.260
Isn't that bizarre?

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:21.020
My guess would be that this is
one of those indirect routes

00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:23.210
that we've already
seen some examples of.

00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:26.270
My guess would be,
more symmetrical faces

00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:29.660
are thus more attractive,
and thus such people

00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:33.090
are treated better and
are more confident in life

00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:36.142
and more extroverted and
more comfortable dancing

00:16:36.142 --> 00:16:37.600
when they knew that
they were going

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:39.230
to wind up looking like Gumby.

00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:42.520
So that is probably what
the indirect route is.

00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:46.630
But running through all of
this is this symmetry business.

00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:48.940
And it's there in
species after species.

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:53.210
And humans are amazing at
picking up subtleties at it.

00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:57.360
One additional finding in
the symmetry world-- women

00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:00.100
at the time that
they are ovulating

00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:05.246
have their faces become ever
so slightly more symmetrical.

00:17:05.246 --> 00:17:06.329
[COMMENTS AMONG  STUDENTS]

00:17:06.329 --> 00:17:09.310
OK, well, that's
going to get people

00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:12.270
all nutsy in the
coming weeks, no doubt,

00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:14.400
trying to figure out
what that's about.

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:17.040
I did not see a good explanation
as to what that was about,

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:19.770
but that has been observed
in the literature.

00:17:19.770 --> 00:17:21.920
So the first thing,
in terms of what

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:23.960
one looks for in
a mate, if you're

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:28.170
some basic social animal-- first
set of features, this business

00:17:28.170 --> 00:17:29.890
about symmetry.

00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:33.430
Next realm-- this whole
world of secondary sexual

00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:34.960
characteristics.

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:39.800
Why is it that female
peacocks like male peacocks

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:42.620
to look like male peacocks,
and all that sort of thing?

00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:44.180
What is that about?

00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:46.980
And people have been working
with this one for years.

00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:49.520
And there is a
zoologist named Zahavi

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:52.270
who has been very influential--
Israeli zoologist--

00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:55.700
who came up with what is called
the "handicap principle."

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:56.700
As follows.

00:17:56.700 --> 00:18:01.400
Why is it that secondary sexual
characteristics are appealing?

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:05.450
Characteristics that exaggerate
the difference in appearance

00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:06.470
by gender.

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:07.500
Why is that appealing?

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:11.570
Because, in effect, the bigger
and more garish and the more

00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:14.700
over-the-top your secondary
sexual characteristic is,

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:17.050
the more you were
communicating to the world,

00:18:17.050 --> 00:18:21.610
I have so much energy on
board, and I am so healthy,

00:18:21.610 --> 00:18:25.090
that I can afford to squander
massive numbers of calories

00:18:25.090 --> 00:18:28.410
on these asinine neon antlers
I'm walking around with.

00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:30.530
That it's an argument
there that this

00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:34.780
is a display of, in a sense,
conspicuous consumption--

00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:39.110
the ability to put energy into
these large secondary sexual

00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:39.990
characteristics.

00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:44.940
That these are markers of health
and of good immune systems.

00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:46.790
Lots of evidence for this.

00:18:46.790 --> 00:18:50.170
And this is, by now, a whole
field that people have studied.

00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:51.690
One version of it.

00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:55.151
These were studies done
with marsupial mice.

00:18:55.151 --> 00:18:56.650
And there was
something having to do

00:18:56.650 --> 00:18:59.280
with their marsupialesque
reproduction that

00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:01.770
made this the species
to do this with.

00:19:01.770 --> 00:19:06.760
But it was doing sperm
insemination of females.

00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:10.150
And what was done was
that they took the sperm

00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:13.850
from these male marsupial
mice, after measuring

00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:16.680
some secondary sexual
characteristics in them.

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:18.550
I believe that they
don't have antlers,

00:19:18.550 --> 00:19:20.740
but I don't remember what
the actual thing was.

00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:22.520
And what they were
able to do was

00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:25.410
to now have sperm from
males of differing

00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:29.340
degrees of exaggerated
secondary characteristics.

00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:32.410
And what they showed
was that the males who

00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:36.190
had the more dramatic secondary
characteristics-- their sperm

00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:38.050
were more fertile.

00:19:38.050 --> 00:19:42.030
So that was a first big vote
in this handicap principle

00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:45.810
that things like
secondary appearances,

00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:51.220
secondary sexual ones,
can be a marker for health

00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:53.320
and/or fertility.

00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:54.900
Now why should that be?

00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:58.870
What you essentially are seeing
there is, it is a display.

00:19:58.870 --> 00:20:00.390
It is a potlatch.

00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:02.430
It is a display
of how much energy

00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:05.650
you can afford to waste
and thus how much you

00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:07.020
must have on board.

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:10.650
It is a marker of health
and good immunity.

00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:13.250
This has been shown
in lots of studies.

00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:16.190
Along the lines
of, the same sort

00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:20.830
of signals that give rise to the
secondary sexual characteristic

00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:23.460
are markers of immune function.

00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:26.050
A well-functioning
immune system will

00:20:26.050 --> 00:20:29.150
be generating some
molecule which

00:20:29.150 --> 00:20:31.480
exaggerates facial coloration.

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:33.676
And that's the secondary
sexual characteristic--

00:20:33.676 --> 00:20:38.630
that there is an explicit
link between immune function,

00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:42.350
immune competence,
and these markers.

00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:43.230
Interesting.

00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:45.240
A study that just
came out recently,

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:48.660
looking at women from,
I believe it was,

00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:51.390
about 20 different
industrialized countries.

00:20:51.390 --> 00:20:55.250
And what was shown was
that, in general, women

00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:57.300
have a preference
for faces of men

00:20:57.300 --> 00:21:00.040
that have strong pronounced
secondary characteristics--

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:03.110
which is, big, jutting
jaw, high forehead,

00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:05.160
lots of muscle stuff going on.

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:09.380
And what they showed was that
the longer the life expectancy

00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:12.480
in the particular country,
the better the economy,

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:16.150
the better the quality of life,
the less women in that country

00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:19.710
had a bias towards
male-looking males.

00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:21.950
Which is extremely interesting.

00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:23.420
What's the comparison there?

00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:26.930
It was all those, like,
Scandinavian countries.

00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:28.740
Thank god for the
Scandinavian countries,

00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:32.370
because they always provide the
extreme of these distributions.

00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:34.250
So, in those
Scandinavian countries,

00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:36.920
like, there has not
been a guy who's been,

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:38.970
like, selected for a date
because of the height

00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:41.710
of his forehead, in centuries.

00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:45.380
Whereas what they showed was,
in a lot of other cultures--

00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:48.360
which were the ones who were
most extreme on the list,

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:50.720
I am not remembering,
which is not very helpful.

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:52.900
But a very different
sort of end of things.

00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:56.040
And there, much stronger
selection for what

00:21:56.040 --> 00:22:00.950
are viewed as traits, as
markers of fecundity and health.

00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:02.760
More evidence about this.

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:08.910
What you see is, all of this
is a signal-- all of this

00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:14.740
is a signal, not only in terms
of who you want to mate with,

00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:18.310
in terms of who you are
passing on your copies of genes

00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:21.890
in cooperation with,
but also the possibility

00:22:21.890 --> 00:22:25.030
that the other individual
is infectious with something

00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:25.740
or other.

00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:28.960
And throughout the
world of social beasts,

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:32.430
nobody likes getting sexually
transmitted diseases.

00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:35.860
And a lot of what this whole
handicap principle is about,

00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:39.530
a lot of this advertising about
what a great immune system you

00:22:39.530 --> 00:22:42.470
have, is a way of
advertising, I do not

00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:44.690
have a communicable disease.

00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:47.330
All sorts of
species-- individuals

00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:50.820
are extremely good at
detecting the smells

00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:54.040
in the others of
parasitic infections,

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:56.300
of all sorts of
other infections,

00:22:56.300 --> 00:22:58.890
and avoiding them
like the plague.

00:22:58.890 --> 00:23:01.810
A common theme in lots
and lots of species.

00:23:01.810 --> 00:23:05.560
Rodents, where it's been most
studied-- a remarkable ability

00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:08.300
to smell out the health
of another individual.

00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:11.540
And this is someone you want to
stay away from-- that they're

00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:13.370
going to give you an STD.

00:23:13.370 --> 00:23:16.280
So that's part of it, as well.

00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:18.330
So, of course, what
you start getting

00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:21.660
are individuals trying
to cheat at all of this.

00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:25.070
And this is suddenly
the world of selection

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:29.240
to uncouple your secondary
sexual characteristics

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:30.640
from your health.

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:32.680
Is there a way to cheat?

00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:33.530
Is there a way?

00:23:33.530 --> 00:23:36.590
And what is seen in
some bird species is,

00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:39.290
you've got some guy on
his deathbed, there.

00:23:39.290 --> 00:23:42.890
And what's he doing with
his last 3 and 1/2 calories

00:23:42.890 --> 00:23:44.000
worth of energy?

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.000
He's expending it
on wing coloration

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.940
or whatever the secondary
characteristic thing is, there,

00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:52.220
that he's got four
minutes of life left,

00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:53.630
and maybe there's
one more chance

00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:55.490
to pass on copies of his genes.

00:23:55.490 --> 00:23:57.210
You get cheating, as well.

00:23:57.210 --> 00:24:00.870
You get cases of
disproportionate shunting

00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:04.280
of caloric investment
towards some of these markers

00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:06.560
amid animals being sick.

00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:09.660
So, of course, you have
to have counterstrategies.

00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:12.840
And we have yet another
world of coevolution

00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:16.040
between some sort of
exploitative strategy

00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:19.170
and a counter one to
try to detect that.

00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:22.070
Then you've got one problem with
this whole literature, which

00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:25.020
is, there is a certain way to
frame things so that you never,

00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:27.270
ever can get a
finding that disagrees

00:24:27.270 --> 00:24:28.890
with your general stance.

00:24:28.890 --> 00:24:30.234
OK, here's how it goes.

00:24:30.234 --> 00:24:31.650
Here's the version
that we've just

00:24:31.650 --> 00:24:33.890
heard of this handicap
principle, which

00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:37.620
is, what you have to have
is your secondary sexual

00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:42.710
characteristic-- the intensity
of it has to be reflective

00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:45.710
of the quality of
your immune system.

00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:49.220
And in lots of species,
facial coloration

00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:52.630
is generated molecules
from the immune system

00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:54.480
in a linear relationship, there.

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:56.570
Yes, that is a way
of advertising,

00:24:56.570 --> 00:24:59.090
I've got a great immune system.

00:24:59.090 --> 00:25:00.090
But get this.

00:25:00.090 --> 00:25:03.630
Meanwhile, you can have
exactly the opposite case,

00:25:03.630 --> 00:25:07.880
which is, you can have your
secondary sexual characteristic

00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:11.120
driven by an infection
that you have.

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:14.690
And what you are presumably
communicating is, if I'm still

00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:17.080
able to do this ridiculous
courtship dance,

00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:19.680
despite the fact that I'm
teeming with parasites,

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:22.710
I've got the greatest
DNA going around, there.

00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:24.070
Hey, how about it?

00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:26.620
Where you see this
is in vultures.

00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:28.811
And the mere notion that
vultures having sex,

00:25:28.811 --> 00:25:31.310
and let alone them having sex
based on thinking some of them

00:25:31.310 --> 00:25:33.310
are more attractive
than others, leaves

00:25:33.310 --> 00:25:36.150
me breathless with admiration.

00:25:36.150 --> 00:25:38.820
But what you see
is, in vultures--

00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:41.950
I'm forgetting which
species-- sexually dimorphic--

00:25:41.950 --> 00:25:43.970
the males have more
colorful faces.

00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:48.330
They tend to have these orange
faces made out of carotenoids--

00:25:48.330 --> 00:25:50.200
these pigment things.

00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:51.430
These carotenoids.

00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:53.660
So one version that
we've heard already

00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:56.480
is, OK, where are the
carotenoids coming from?

00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:58.540
They're produced in
the immune system.

00:25:58.540 --> 00:26:01.890
And the happier your immune
system, the more carotenoids

00:26:01.890 --> 00:26:02.870
you pump out.

00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:05.010
That would be the first
scenario we've heard.

00:26:05.010 --> 00:26:08.520
In vultures, you see
exactly the opposite.

00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:11.851
Which is, where-- this is going
to go downhill really fast,

00:26:11.851 --> 00:26:12.350
now.

00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:14.470
So where do you get
carotenoids, if you

00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:17.010
are a vulture in the
plains of East Africa?

00:26:17.010 --> 00:26:21.360
You get them by
eating ungulate feces.

00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:25.065
Which vultures are perfectly
happy to do, if it's fresh--

00:26:25.065 --> 00:26:26.840
or even if it's not so fresh.

00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:30.480
And what that will typically
contain are lots of parasites.

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:32.770
Consuming a whole lot
of ungulate feces,

00:26:32.770 --> 00:26:34.820
rather than, say,
ungulate muscle,

00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:37.740
increases the likelihood that
you have some sort of infection

00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:38.790
that you've picked up.

00:26:38.790 --> 00:26:40.620
What's the interpretation there?

00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:45.140
Yet here I am, bouncing around
happily and energetically.

00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:47.300
Just imagine how
great my genes are,

00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:51.380
if I'm able to do that amid just
teeming with parasites, because

00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:54.820
of my unlikely sort
of dietary habits.

00:26:54.820 --> 00:26:57.870
So you've got it, here,
that it can go both ways.

00:26:57.870 --> 00:27:00.930
Ooh, dramatic secondary
sexual characteristic

00:27:00.930 --> 00:27:02.960
is a marker of a
good immune system--

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:04.540
I can fight off disease.

00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:08.110
Dramatic secondary sexual
characteristic as a marker of,

00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:10.020
look how well I'm
functioning, here,

00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:12.590
despite teeming
with some disease.

00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:13.620
You get it both ways.

00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:16.220
It remains very,
very controversial--

00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:19.200
for the three and a half people
who deeply care about this.

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:22.880
One additional version of that--
and the "there's no free lunch,

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:26.620
and there is no free
ungulate"-- whatever-- OK,

00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:29.960
one additional version of that
are studies now showing that

00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:34.530
in lions what you get is--
highly tournament species,

00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:37.790
and thus a highly dramatic
set of secondary sexual

00:27:37.790 --> 00:27:38.810
characteristics.

00:27:38.810 --> 00:27:39.890
The manes.

00:27:39.890 --> 00:27:41.470
The manes on the lion.

00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:43.870
And what everybody
knows from The Lion King

00:27:43.870 --> 00:27:46.380
is that they can be very
big and dramatic-looking

00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:48.947
and thus make you
very attractive.

00:27:48.947 --> 00:27:50.530
Unless you're hanging
out with hyenas.

00:27:50.530 --> 00:27:53.780
But what is clear, also,
is, it comes with a price.

00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:57.560
What is the most attractive
sort of male lion you can see?

00:27:57.560 --> 00:27:59.470
It's a black-maned male.

00:27:59.470 --> 00:28:03.090
Because that is one
that is most expensive,

00:28:03.090 --> 00:28:05.420
in this
handicap-principle sense.

00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:07.180
But there's a
downside, if you've

00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:11.240
got a black mane, which is,
your head heats up more, sitting

00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:12.820
there in the African sun.

00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:16.090
You've got to spend more
energy on thermal regulation.

00:28:16.090 --> 00:28:17.890
There's a downside to it.

00:28:17.890 --> 00:28:21.010
All of these things,
where you're balancing.

00:28:21.010 --> 00:28:21.990
What else?

00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:23.690
What else, in terms
of attractiveness?

00:28:23.690 --> 00:28:25.680
So we've now got,
lots of species,

00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:28.830
the symmetry business
as a marker for health.

00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:32.090
The secondary sexual
characteristic nonsense

00:28:32.090 --> 00:28:35.170
stuff as a marker of
health but interpretable

00:28:35.170 --> 00:28:36.900
in a number of different ways.

00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:40.290
Then there are the secondary
sexual characteristics

00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:43.970
that are more directly
markers of fertility.

00:28:43.970 --> 00:28:45.840
And what we've
entered into, here,

00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:48.940
is the world of primate
species, where females

00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:51.890
have external swellings
when ovulating,

00:28:51.890 --> 00:28:56.340
when there are visible signs
of estrus, of going into heat.

00:28:56.340 --> 00:28:58.550
Humans are concealed ovulators.

00:28:58.550 --> 00:29:00.940
And we already know some
of the theories about that.

00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:05.560
But all the other primates get
explicit, observable estrus

00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:09.300
swellings when it is time
that they're ovulating.

00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:12.030
And all you need to
do is look at baboons.

00:29:12.030 --> 00:29:14.110
And beginning somewhere
around junior high,

00:29:14.110 --> 00:29:17.270
when they start hitting
puberty, some females

00:29:17.270 --> 00:29:19.560
have bigger swellings
than other females.

00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:23.270
And it turns out, these
stupid, shallow male baboons

00:29:23.270 --> 00:29:25.560
prefer the ones with the
big swellings to the ones

00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:26.870
with the small swellings.

00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:29.590
You can even show, with
captive male baboons,

00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:31.840
that they will
lever-press more to get

00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:34.250
to see pictures
of female baboons

00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:36.920
with big swellings instead
of middle-sized ones

00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:37.840
or little ones.

00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:41.330
There you go.

00:29:41.330 --> 00:29:45.000
Somewhere out there, there
is a magnificent reality

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.690
show to be set up
along those lines.

00:29:47.690 --> 00:29:50.900
What you see with that is,
what's the swellings about?

00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:54.320
It is a marker of
estrogen levels.

00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:57.660
It is a marker of-- the
higher the estrogen levels,

00:29:57.660 --> 00:29:59.270
the more the swelling.

00:29:59.270 --> 00:30:02.110
And what you wind up
seeing, in various studies

00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:04.630
by now, replicated,
showing that,

00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:08.180
among female nonhuman
primates, those females

00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:12.090
with larger swellings have
a better infant survival

00:30:12.090 --> 00:30:14.140
during the first year
of life of the kids.

00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:18.580
It's a marker of greater
fertility and greater health.

00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:22.640
And there's maybe some element
of a handicap principle

00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:25.690
there, because by the time
you get female monkeys

00:30:25.690 --> 00:30:28.170
with the biggest
swellings around, they now

00:30:28.170 --> 00:30:31.780
weigh about 25% more than they
weigh the rest of the time,

00:30:31.780 --> 00:30:34.030
all because of the
water retention.

00:30:34.030 --> 00:30:35.630
And presumably
part of the signal

00:30:35.630 --> 00:30:38.090
there is, if I can
be running around

00:30:38.090 --> 00:30:40.070
in my female-in-estrus
sort of way,

00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:44.440
despite 25% more weight sloshing
around at the end of me, just

00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:46.790
imagine how strong
and healthy I am.

00:30:46.790 --> 00:30:49.920
So that, as a source
of attraction.

00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:52.530
Meanwhile, over at the
male end of things,

00:30:52.530 --> 00:30:57.280
in terms of looking for
other markers of attraction

00:30:57.280 --> 00:30:59.620
in females-- by the
time you get to humans,

00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:02.240
we are not, again,
external ovulators.

00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:07.310
But what you have with humans
is the famed waist-hip ratio

00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:08.060
measure.

00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:11.860
And this one has been endlessly
studied and argued about.

00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:15.970
The notion that the larger
the size of the hips,

00:31:15.970 --> 00:31:18.660
relative to the size of
the waist, the greater

00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:21.850
the waist-hip ratio--
no, the lesser

00:31:21.850 --> 00:31:24.110
the-- flip that
around the other way.

00:31:24.110 --> 00:31:24.650
OK.

00:31:24.650 --> 00:31:27.300
The bigger the hips are,
relative to the waist--

00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:29.630
this is a marker of fertility.

00:31:29.630 --> 00:31:32.970
That is a marker of
childbearing pelvises.

00:31:32.970 --> 00:31:35.850
That is a marker of all
sorts of developmental health

00:31:35.850 --> 00:31:39.200
that augurs well for having
a baby pass through the birth

00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:39.870
canal.

00:31:39.870 --> 00:31:42.990
In culture after
culture, men find

00:31:42.990 --> 00:31:46.910
women to be more attractive
who have a higher-skewed ratio

00:31:46.910 --> 00:31:49.260
of hip to waist.

00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:52.130
So that's been studied
all over the place.

00:31:52.130 --> 00:31:55.100
What you have, though, as
the central controversy

00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:58.230
in that field is, if every
single culture that that's

00:31:58.230 --> 00:32:02.140
been studied in has been
contaminated by their exposure

00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:05.550
to westernized culture
and its pervasive values,

00:32:05.550 --> 00:32:07.180
which may be the source of that.

00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:10.270
So, among the hip-waist
sort of zealots,

00:32:10.270 --> 00:32:15.150
what has been the Golden
Fleece to go after,

00:32:15.150 --> 00:32:17.440
what has been the
equivalent of getting

00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:20.700
identical twins separated at
birth, what is the thing they

00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:23.900
go after, is to find
a population of humans

00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:27.070
who are having their first
contact with the outside world

00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:30.360
and have had no exposure
to the westernized world.

00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:32.880
And thus you are able
to rush in there,

00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:34.970
quickly master their
language, and, once you've

00:32:34.970 --> 00:32:37.280
done that, you get to ask
them the first question

00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:40.430
in their entire content with
the westernized world, which

00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:42.670
is, so, which of these
look better to you?

00:32:42.670 --> 00:32:44.140
Asking the guys, there.

00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:47.100
And, at this point--
not surprisingly,

00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:49.550
there is not a huge
literature of asking people,

00:32:49.550 --> 00:32:52.990
on the first encounters, about
hip-waist ratios-- what you see

00:32:52.990 --> 00:32:55.380
is, the literature is mixed.

00:32:55.380 --> 00:32:58.080
When you look at more
traditional societies,

00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:00.980
you do not necessarily
see as strong

00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:05.200
of a hip-waist-ratio
set of opinions.

00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:07.260
But nonetheless, at
least some of that

00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:10.120
is universal in every culture
that's been looked at.

00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:13.610
Again, as a marker of fertility.

00:33:13.610 --> 00:33:16.097
Meanwhile, over at the
female end of things,

00:33:16.097 --> 00:33:17.930
you've already heard
what some of the things

00:33:17.930 --> 00:33:21.050
are that are looked for,
in terms of responsiveness

00:33:21.050 --> 00:33:23.260
to secondary
characteristics in males,

00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:28.550
which is jutting jaws, big,
high foreheads, and muscle mass.

00:33:28.550 --> 00:33:31.660
And all of these are
assays indirectly

00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:33.990
of testosterone
levels or testosterone

00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:37.270
exposure or sensitivity
during adolescence.

00:33:37.270 --> 00:33:39.530
Those are preferred.

00:33:39.530 --> 00:33:40.940
Interesting thing.

00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:43.920
Studies showing that,
when you give women

00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:47.970
a choice of faces of males
that have been manipulated,

00:33:47.970 --> 00:33:50.120
changing the
dramatic-- how dramatic

00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:52.810
the secondary characteristics
are-- like forehead

00:33:52.810 --> 00:33:56.910
and jutting-jawedness and
angularity of face and stuff--

00:33:56.910 --> 00:33:59.540
what you see is an
interesting dichotomy.

00:33:59.540 --> 00:34:03.240
Which is, in these studies,
women on the average rate

00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:06.990
the rounder-faced
pictures of men, such men,

00:34:06.990 --> 00:34:11.830
looking more likable, more
honest, more trustworthy,

00:34:11.830 --> 00:34:15.969
and less desirable.

00:34:15.969 --> 00:34:16.739
OK.

00:34:16.739 --> 00:34:19.300
So this is hopeless.

00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:20.239
And what do you know?

00:34:20.239 --> 00:34:23.590
Those-- well, I won't
go there, either.

00:34:23.590 --> 00:34:27.600
What those show is
separable traits, there.

00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:29.400
Separable traits,
in terms of what's

00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:30.800
attractive-- what information.

00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:33.219
And, again, when you
look at these studies,

00:34:33.219 --> 00:34:37.915
the differences are, like, 5%
difference in nostril width

00:34:37.915 --> 00:34:41.179
and things, when they're manip--
these are extraordinarily

00:34:41.179 --> 00:34:44.639
subtle differences, where
people are not consciously aware

00:34:44.639 --> 00:34:45.159
of them.

00:34:45.159 --> 00:34:47.690
Which face looks
more attractive?

00:34:47.690 --> 00:34:49.850
Which face would you like more?

00:34:49.850 --> 00:34:52.590
Which face would you trust
more if they told you

00:34:52.590 --> 00:34:54.440
to vote for somebody or other?

00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:58.150
An interesting
separation, there.

00:34:58.150 --> 00:34:58.850
OK.

00:34:58.850 --> 00:35:03.250
One additional one
is that, in women,

00:35:03.250 --> 00:35:06.010
when women are
ovulating, they prefer

00:35:06.010 --> 00:35:08.770
more sexually secondary,
secondary-sexually

00:35:08.770 --> 00:35:11.430
characteristically
dramatic male faces.

00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:15.710
At the time of ovulation, women
rate as more attractive male

00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:19.990
faces with the juttier jaws
and the greater muscle mass

00:35:19.990 --> 00:35:22.020
and the forehead stuff going on.

00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:26.930
What we see here is this theme
of, at the time that estrogen

00:35:26.930 --> 00:35:30.090
levels are at their highest
in humans and lots of realms,

00:35:30.090 --> 00:35:32.770
in addition to other
species, detection

00:35:32.770 --> 00:35:35.850
of pheromones from males
is the most sensitive.

00:35:35.850 --> 00:35:38.030
Ability to pick up
subtle differences

00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:42.180
in facial symmetry or secondary
sexual characteristics

00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:43.120
are at their best.

00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:45.320
And the preferences
are derived from that.

00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:50.140
This is, in some cases, some
rather substantial effects.

00:35:50.140 --> 00:35:50.920
OK.

00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:53.550
So, what other things?

00:35:53.550 --> 00:35:56.761
There's one problem that runs
through this entire literature.

00:35:56.761 --> 00:35:57.260
OK.

00:35:57.260 --> 00:35:58.880
So here's the deal.

00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:03.380
You are a-- uh--
you're a gazelle.

00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:06.685
You're a female gazelle, and
you have read lots of zoology

00:36:06.685 --> 00:36:08.775
and you know all about
this handicap principle.

00:36:08.775 --> 00:36:12.170
And you know the fact that
big, dramatic secondary sexual

00:36:12.170 --> 00:36:14.640
characteristics on
guys is a marker

00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:17.440
of better immune systems
and more fertile sperm

00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:18.930
and all sorts of great stuff.

00:36:18.930 --> 00:36:22.270
So you go out of your way to
go and find one of those guys.

00:36:22.270 --> 00:36:23.620
You mate with him.

00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:26.090
And you've just given birth.

00:36:26.090 --> 00:36:30.290
So, knowing what you know, what
you, of course, now realize

00:36:30.290 --> 00:36:33.060
is, you've got a great
kid on your hands

00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:34.830
that have all these
terrific genes

00:36:34.830 --> 00:36:38.640
from that jutting-jawed
antelope guy you mated with.

00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:41.010
And you better make
sure this kid survives,

00:36:41.010 --> 00:36:43.570
because they have an
enormous potential

00:36:43.570 --> 00:36:46.470
for having a big reproductive
success later on.

00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:47.860
What do you do?

00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:52.360
You expend more calories
in taking care of them.

00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:55.180
This has been shown in
all sorts of species.

00:36:55.180 --> 00:36:59.680
Mate various birds in various
bird species-- mate females

00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:04.070
with males who are more
attractive versus mating them

00:37:04.070 --> 00:37:06.300
with less attractive,
and what you see

00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:08.720
is that the females
who have mated

00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:14.270
with the more attractive males
give birth to bigger eggs.

00:37:14.270 --> 00:37:15.620
That's interesting.

00:37:15.620 --> 00:37:18.270
OK, so you're seeing the
evidence of the good genes

00:37:18.270 --> 00:37:19.550
coming from the guy.

00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:22.610
Male genes have nothing
to do with egg size.

00:37:22.610 --> 00:37:25.410
It is how much
protein the mother

00:37:25.410 --> 00:37:28.690
puts into the egg production
and the egg development.

00:37:28.690 --> 00:37:32.430
And what you see is, she
makes this a self-fulfilling

00:37:32.430 --> 00:37:33.400
prophecy.

00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:35.510
In a lot of species,
now, it has been

00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:39.070
shown that when females mate
with more attractive males

00:37:39.070 --> 00:37:42.280
they put more effort into
having the offspring survive.

00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:43.860
The offspring survive better.

00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:45.520
And yes, what do you know?

00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:48.010
You really do want to mate
with guys with big antlers

00:37:48.010 --> 00:37:49.120
and that sort of thing.

00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:52.000
This big problem with
self-fulfilling stuff.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.070
So that's a confound that
has run through the field.

00:37:55.070 --> 00:37:57.230
Another confound--
and here is one

00:37:57.230 --> 00:38:01.100
that shows how many species
are far less distant from us

00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:02.180
than one might think.

00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:04.670
This was work by a
guy named Lee Dugatkin

00:38:04.670 --> 00:38:07.160
at the University of Kentucky.

00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:11.750
And what he does is study
ospreys or some kind

00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:13.750
of bird thing that runs around.

00:38:13.750 --> 00:38:19.440
And what he does is, he first
gets a male and female osprey,

00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:21.230
and he introduces
them to each other.

00:38:21.230 --> 00:38:23.360
And what he looks
for are circumstances

00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:26.390
where the magic does not occur.

00:38:26.390 --> 00:38:28.080
There is no chemistry
between them.

00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:30.090
The female rejects the guy.

00:38:30.090 --> 00:38:33.880
And, at that point, what he
does is, in the next round,

00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:37.560
he makes the male appear
to be very popular.

00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:40.300
He puts the male here,
and he takes a whole bunch

00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:43.400
of stuffed female birds
and puts them around

00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:47.740
in a circle around him, gawking
at him with rapt admiration

00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:50.625
and just frozen in their
place at the wonders of, like,

00:38:50.625 --> 00:38:54.110
the coloration on his bill from
eating who-knows-whose feces.

00:38:54.110 --> 00:38:56.710
And what you see
then is, the female

00:38:56.710 --> 00:39:00.190
who spurned him is
now more likely to do

00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:03.195
solicitive courting
gestures with him.

00:39:03.195 --> 00:39:06.960
In other words, she's
jumping on a bandwagon.

00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:09.510
And this has now been shown
in a number of species.

00:39:09.510 --> 00:39:11.185
What's the logic of this?

00:39:11.185 --> 00:39:14.090
This is exactly what secondary
sexual characteristics

00:39:14.090 --> 00:39:14.930
are about.

00:39:14.930 --> 00:39:17.270
I don't understand
why anyone considers

00:39:17.270 --> 00:39:18.550
that to be attractive.

00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:20.740
This individual
does nothing for me.

00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:24.820
But if it appears to be the
case that those traits are very

00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:27.990
popular, and thus those
traits are predictors

00:39:27.990 --> 00:39:30.470
of being able to pass on
many copies of your genes,

00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:32.960
I sure want my kids
to have those traits.

00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:36.060
And thus this bandwagon effect.

00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:39.180
So all of these are
versions of just shallow,

00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:41.470
shallow,
horrible-values versions

00:39:41.470 --> 00:39:43.000
of who one looks for in a mate.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:46.110
But then, of course, we go to
all the pair-bonding species.

00:39:46.110 --> 00:39:48.350
And as we heard from
many lectures ago,

00:39:48.350 --> 00:39:51.720
the rituals in lots of those
species of male courtship

00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:55.740
built around showing that
they are a competent parent.

00:39:55.740 --> 00:39:59.100
Showing that they can do some
rough approximation of acting

00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:00.800
like a mother to these babies.

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:01.890
What's that about?

00:40:01.890 --> 00:40:05.490
And that's the whole world
of male birds doing courtship

00:40:05.490 --> 00:40:09.350
by bringing worms and feeding
the mother and showing, look,

00:40:09.350 --> 00:40:10.970
I know what kind
of things we eat.

00:40:10.970 --> 00:40:12.480
I know how to bring a worm.

00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:16.010
By the time you get to
pair-bonding species,

00:40:16.010 --> 00:40:19.160
the rituals and what is
attractive are often markers

00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:23.190
not of fertility but of
parenting skill-- parenting

00:40:23.190 --> 00:40:24.490
competence.

00:40:24.490 --> 00:40:28.590
Flipped the other way, in
most nonhuman primate species

00:40:28.590 --> 00:40:30.850
that have been looked
at, when are females

00:40:30.850 --> 00:40:34.070
most attractive to males,
independent of the size

00:40:34.070 --> 00:40:35.450
of their estrus swelling?

00:40:35.450 --> 00:40:38.170
When they've already
had a couple of kids.

00:40:38.170 --> 00:40:41.540
Females, the first-time-out
rounds of ovulating,

00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:43.480
are less preferred
than females who have

00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:45.070
had a number of kids already.

00:40:45.070 --> 00:40:48.930
If it is the same thing going
on, what she has already proven

00:40:48.930 --> 00:40:51.140
is she's competent
enough that she didn't

00:40:51.140 --> 00:40:52.880
kill the kids by
dropping them out

00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:54.530
of the tree at various points.

00:40:54.530 --> 00:40:59.110
This being as a marker,
again, of competence.

00:40:59.110 --> 00:40:59.880
OK.

00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:03.120
Final realm of what one
looks for in a mate,

00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:05.370
across lots and lots
of different species.

00:41:05.370 --> 00:41:07.910
Which is not only
someone who appears

00:41:07.910 --> 00:41:10.690
healthy and symmetrical,
and these exciting secondary

00:41:10.690 --> 00:41:14.210
characteristics that are
markers of lots of fertility,

00:41:14.210 --> 00:41:16.990
and also whatever everybody
else thinks is attractive,

00:41:16.990 --> 00:41:19.450
you suddenly do as well--
the last thing that

00:41:19.450 --> 00:41:22.250
tends to be a theme through
lots and lots of species,

00:41:22.250 --> 00:41:24.270
and in every human
culture, is being

00:41:24.270 --> 00:41:29.350
attracted to someone who's
kind of just like you are.

00:41:29.350 --> 00:41:31.990
Being attracted to
someone who is similar.

00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:35.250
And the term for
this is "homogamy."

00:41:35.250 --> 00:41:39.050
Homogamy, polygamy, monogamy.

00:41:39.050 --> 00:41:42.330
In this case, homogamy--
mating with someone

00:41:42.330 --> 00:41:47.770
who is homogeneous, who is
similar in traits of yours.

00:41:47.770 --> 00:41:51.510
And across cultures, including
in the United States,

00:41:51.510 --> 00:41:56.590
people are extremely homogamous
in who they wind up marrying.

00:41:56.590 --> 00:41:59.250
Here are the statistics.

00:41:59.250 --> 00:42:01.770
When you look at
couples in this country,

00:42:01.770 --> 00:42:05.850
there is better than a
90%-chance likelihood of them

00:42:05.850 --> 00:42:09.980
sharing the same religion, of
being within three years of age

00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:13.420
of each other, of sharing the
same race-- the ethnicity--

00:42:13.420 --> 00:42:17.220
sharing the socioeconomic
status of their childhood--

00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:20.400
did they both grow up
poor, wealthy, whatever--

00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:22.400
and sharing political views.

00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:25.610
More than 90% concordance
in this country

00:42:25.610 --> 00:42:29.440
on those traits-- markers
of homogamous preference

00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:31.330
for someone who
is just like you.

00:42:31.330 --> 00:42:35.820
Stepping down a bit-- not in
this range-- but more than 40%

00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:39.730
homogamy for a couple
having IQs that are within,

00:42:39.730 --> 00:42:42.150
I don't know, five points
of each other-- having

00:42:42.150 --> 00:42:44.400
similar levels of education.

00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:46.820
Those are very
homogamous traits.

00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:49.000
Then a whole bunch
of weirdo minor ones

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:52.360
which, nonetheless, are still
statistically significant.

00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:57.470
A 20% to 40%
likelihood of couples

00:42:57.470 --> 00:42:59.940
being the same height--
not the same height,

00:42:59.940 --> 00:43:02.195
but say, for example,
in the top 10

00:43:02.195 --> 00:43:05.090
percentile of height
for their sex-- scaled

00:43:05.090 --> 00:43:06.670
to what's within gender.

00:43:06.670 --> 00:43:08.530
Weight, hair color.

00:43:08.530 --> 00:43:13.560
And then you get into this
bizarre world of lung capacity,

00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:17.200
of width of nostrils,
of width of eyes.

00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:20.180
People have studied these,
and these are traits

00:43:20.180 --> 00:43:22.450
that show significant homogamy.

00:43:22.450 --> 00:43:25.790
In this fairly low range,
but nonetheless significant

00:43:25.790 --> 00:43:27.430
at a higher-than-expected rate.

00:43:27.430 --> 00:43:30.230
What are these weird
things being about?

00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:32.110
These are probably
surrogate markers

00:43:32.110 --> 00:43:36.070
for preferring people of
similar race, similar ethnicity.

00:43:36.070 --> 00:43:39.210
That's probably where those
numbers are coming from.

00:43:39.210 --> 00:43:40.960
So what's this about?

00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:44.100
This is suddenly barreling
us back into the world

00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:46.680
from many lectures
ago of, you don't

00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:48.560
want to mate with
someone who shares

00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:51.780
half their genes with you--
the dangers of inbreeding.

00:43:51.780 --> 00:43:53.910
But you also don't
necessarily want

00:43:53.910 --> 00:43:56.400
to mate with someone who
is so unrelated that there

00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:59.540
is no drive of kin
selection for cooperation.

00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:03.340
We have now heard, from
bird species to humans,

00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:05.580
you get the optimal
fertility somewhere

00:44:05.580 --> 00:44:07.830
around third to fourth cousins.

00:44:07.830 --> 00:44:11.280
You get the optimal
fertility, under circumstances

00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:14.120
that select for a fair
degree of homogamy

00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:16.120
across different cultures.

00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:19.930
And historically, this
is no surprise at all--

00:44:19.930 --> 00:44:22.930
that there is a great
deal of homogamy.

00:44:22.930 --> 00:44:26.170
Various studies have shown
that your average traditional

00:44:26.170 --> 00:44:28.360
hunter-gatherer winds
up being married

00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:31.450
to somebody who grew up
less than 40 kilometers away

00:44:31.450 --> 00:44:32.630
from them.

00:44:32.630 --> 00:44:35.510
Studies show that people
in traditional agricultural

00:44:35.510 --> 00:44:37.750
villages in the
developing world wind up

00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:40.520
being married to someone,
on the average, less than 10

00:44:40.520 --> 00:44:42.320
kilometers away from them.

00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:45.890
You are getting an awful
lot of people winding up

00:44:45.890 --> 00:44:49.220
being married with individuals
who look a lot like them.

00:44:49.220 --> 00:44:53.300
And back to that issue
of partial relatedness--

00:44:53.300 --> 00:44:54.590
third to fourth cousins.

00:44:54.590 --> 00:44:55.516
Yes.

00:44:55.516 --> 00:44:58.550
But couldn't it just be that
I know a lot more people who

00:44:58.550 --> 00:45:01.035
are the same age as
me, the same race,

00:45:01.035 --> 00:45:04.020
the same socioeconomic
status, and so on?

00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:07.430
OK, well, though,
look around the room.

00:45:07.430 --> 00:45:10.330
This is a very
heterogeneous corner

00:45:10.330 --> 00:45:12.440
of the planet we've
come up with, here.

00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:14.010
Yes, it's very
different when you

00:45:14.010 --> 00:45:16.460
look in more homogeneous
societies, there.

00:45:16.460 --> 00:45:19.460
But when you begin to look
at the increasingly diverse

00:45:19.460 --> 00:45:22.060
Western European ones,
you see a fair amount

00:45:22.060 --> 00:45:24.580
of homogamy going on.

00:45:24.580 --> 00:45:26.580
Very interesting data.

00:45:26.580 --> 00:45:29.740
Iceland-- yet another of
our good-old Scandinavian--

00:45:29.740 --> 00:45:31.680
is Iceland technically
Scandinavian?

00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:33.470
Or are they just,
like, good guys

00:45:33.470 --> 00:45:34.960
who should be Scandinavians?

00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:38.801
They're so dull and
healthy and sensible.

00:45:38.801 --> 00:45:39.300
OK.

00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:42.660
So in those sensible,
non-Scandinavian Icelandics,

00:45:42.660 --> 00:45:45.350
who have, like-- I
don't know, what?

00:45:45.350 --> 00:45:48.000
--300,000 people in the whole
country, and all of them

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:51.540
are no more than sixth
cousins apart, and all of them

00:45:51.540 --> 00:45:55.520
have just fanatically clean
records, going back centuries,

00:45:55.520 --> 00:45:57.700
as to who was married
to who, studies

00:45:57.700 --> 00:46:01.280
have now been done, looking
over the course of 200 years,

00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:06.040
in Iceland of how closely
related different couples were.

00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:10.360
And what you see is, optimal
fertility, optimal number

00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:13.640
of children who
survived into adulthood,

00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:17.130
you get from third- to
fourth-cousin marriages.

00:46:17.130 --> 00:46:19.990
Recent studies showing that.

00:46:19.990 --> 00:46:22.200
One additional,
interesting version

00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:26.550
of this homogamy stuff, which
is, in the United States

00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:28.710
you see something
slightly different.

00:46:28.710 --> 00:46:31.310
You see an age factor
coming in here,

00:46:31.310 --> 00:46:37.040
which is, people are more likely
to make less homogamous choices

00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:42.010
as to their mates, the younger
they are when they get married.

00:46:42.010 --> 00:46:44.070
What's that a surrogate for?

00:46:44.070 --> 00:46:47.110
The incredibly depressing
fact that, on the average,

00:46:47.110 --> 00:46:49.290
people get more and
more closed-minded

00:46:49.290 --> 00:46:50.560
as they get older.

00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:54.330
You see the greatest
heterogamy in marriages--

00:46:54.330 --> 00:46:57.480
the greatest likelihood
of people marrying someone

00:46:57.480 --> 00:47:00.330
with a very different
background, the younger they

00:47:00.330 --> 00:47:00.830
are.

00:47:00.830 --> 00:47:03.460
In the early 20s is
when you find the peak

00:47:03.460 --> 00:47:06.590
for a lot of these traits-- when
you find the least homogamy.

00:47:06.590 --> 00:47:11.400
One interesting exception to
that, or a partial exception,

00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:12.970
which is with religion.

00:47:12.970 --> 00:47:17.200
And what you see is, you
look at people getting

00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:18.890
married in their early 20s.

00:47:18.890 --> 00:47:20.850
This is the likelihood
of marrying somebody

00:47:20.850 --> 00:47:22.250
from a different religion.

00:47:22.250 --> 00:47:26.030
And then it goes way
down in the 30s and 40s.

00:47:26.030 --> 00:47:29.210
And somewhere between
50 and 60, there's

00:47:29.210 --> 00:47:31.060
another little
blip that goes up.

00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:33.960
And this has been documented
in a number of studies.

00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:36.680
What's that blip about?

00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:39.910
Any theories?

00:47:39.910 --> 00:47:42.606
Oh-- OK, somebody
[INAUDIBLE] there.

00:47:42.606 --> 00:47:45.100
Um-- fewer options for mates?

00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:46.900
Fewer options for mates.

00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:49.380
That's one depressing
possibility.

00:47:49.380 --> 00:47:53.550
And just wait until you're in
the nursing home and, like,

00:47:53.550 --> 00:47:55.460
anything that moves
you imprint on.

00:47:55.460 --> 00:47:56.965
Yes, theory?

00:47:56.965 --> 00:47:58.590
They're not going to
have kids anymore,

00:47:58.590 --> 00:48:00.510
so they don't need to
worry about passing down

00:48:00.510 --> 00:48:01.593
[INAUDIBLE] to their kids.

00:48:01.593 --> 00:48:02.200
OK.

00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:05.370
So the issue of-- if you
do that, if you have waited

00:48:05.370 --> 00:48:07.870
long enough that you're not
going to have kids, that you're

00:48:07.870 --> 00:48:09.810
not going to have
all these fights of,

00:48:09.810 --> 00:48:15.020
are you going to be a, you know,
a Mac family or a PC family

00:48:15.020 --> 00:48:17.670
or all those sorts of things
that can tear people apart

00:48:17.670 --> 00:48:18.370
[INAUDIBLE].

00:48:18.370 --> 00:48:19.624
OK, so that's a possibility.

00:48:19.624 --> 00:48:20.540
How about another one?

00:48:20.540 --> 00:48:21.040
Yeah.

00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:23.020
You're reflecting
your mortality.

00:48:23.020 --> 00:48:25.130
OK, you're reflecting
on mortality,

00:48:25.130 --> 00:48:28.850
and you're deciding,
enough of that nonsense.

00:48:28.850 --> 00:48:29.840
Who cares?

00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:32.580
This is someone who matters.

00:48:32.580 --> 00:48:33.920
Yes, that's a possibility.

00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:34.690
What else?

00:48:34.690 --> 00:48:35.410
Was that an idea?

00:48:35.410 --> 00:48:36.810
Midlife crisis?

00:48:36.810 --> 00:48:38.200
Midlife crisis.

00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:40.020
So it's either you
get a convertible

00:48:40.020 --> 00:48:44.190
or you marry someone
from, you know,

00:48:44.190 --> 00:48:46.260
Tierra Del Fuego or something.

00:48:46.260 --> 00:48:48.260
So all of those
seem to go into it.

00:48:48.260 --> 00:48:51.550
One additional one, which
I find to be absolutely,

00:48:51.550 --> 00:48:54.990
like, wonderful, in terms
of just how bizarre it is.

00:48:54.990 --> 00:48:57.190
Which is, when they
interview people,

00:48:57.190 --> 00:49:00.910
what you also see is, the ones
who tend to have this peak,

00:49:00.910 --> 00:49:03.140
they have been in
long-term relationships

00:49:03.140 --> 00:49:05.090
with the individual.

00:49:05.090 --> 00:49:06.540
What was that about?

00:49:06.540 --> 00:49:09.240
They're waiting for
their parents to die,

00:49:09.240 --> 00:49:11.653
so they don't kill them
by marrying this person.

00:49:11.653 --> 00:49:12.380
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:12.380 --> 00:49:15.160
That appears to be
part of that scenario.

00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:19.160
Which is, once they're dead,
then we can go get married.

00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:21.960
Because I couldn't possibly
do this to them before then.

00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:25.950
And that appears to be
part of this peak, also.

00:49:25.950 --> 00:49:26.500
OK.

00:49:26.500 --> 00:49:30.350
Finally-- finally, a
study-- famous study

00:49:30.350 --> 00:49:32.150
that was done
about 15 years ago,

00:49:32.150 --> 00:49:35.340
by an evolutionary biologist
named David Buss, who's

00:49:35.340 --> 00:49:37.190
now at the University of Texas.

00:49:37.190 --> 00:49:38.190
He wasn't, at the time.

00:49:38.190 --> 00:49:40.330
And he did one of
these sorts of studies

00:49:40.330 --> 00:49:45.660
that we recognize by now, which
is sort of questioning people,

00:49:45.660 --> 00:49:49.530
questionnaires of people from
a lot of different cultures,

00:49:49.530 --> 00:49:51.170
all over the planet.

00:49:51.170 --> 00:49:55.589
And this was this massive study
of I don't remember how many

00:49:55.589 --> 00:49:56.380
different cultures.

00:49:56.380 --> 00:49:59.800
But it ranged from
non-westernized, nomadic

00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:02.890
pastoralists, non-westernized
agriculturalists,

00:50:02.890 --> 00:50:07.050
socialist countries, communist
ones, capitalist ones--

00:50:07.050 --> 00:50:10.450
everything in between--
individualistic societies,

00:50:10.450 --> 00:50:12.500
communalist societies--
all of that.

00:50:12.500 --> 00:50:15.180
It was tens of thousands
of people in the study.

00:50:15.180 --> 00:50:18.710
Where he gave all these
people a list of traits.

00:50:18.710 --> 00:50:21.090
And he would say,
which of these traits

00:50:21.090 --> 00:50:24.640
are most important to you,
in terms of who you marry?

00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:27.540
And what came out in
every single culture

00:50:27.540 --> 00:50:30.230
looked at-- as follows.

00:50:30.230 --> 00:50:33.370
In every culture
looked at, women

00:50:33.370 --> 00:50:39.570
are more likely than men to want
a mate who is older than them.

00:50:39.570 --> 00:50:43.880
In every culture looked at,
men, more common than women,

00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:47.780
looking for someone
who's younger than them.

00:50:47.780 --> 00:50:52.440
In every culture looked
at, women more than men

00:50:52.440 --> 00:50:56.310
citing the economic
prowess of this individual

00:50:56.310 --> 00:50:58.410
as being part of
what constitutes

00:50:58.410 --> 00:51:01.720
the desirable traits.

00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:04.580
In every one of them
that's been looked at,

00:51:04.580 --> 00:51:08.830
men having a greater preference
than women for markers-- health

00:51:08.830 --> 00:51:13.160
markers-- of fertility in the
person they would wind up with.

00:51:13.160 --> 00:51:16.250
This was so depressing,
because this

00:51:16.250 --> 00:51:19.500
is every culture on this planet
coming up with this cliche.

00:51:19.500 --> 00:51:21.790
Everybody learned
about the study,

00:51:21.790 --> 00:51:24.780
and how remarkably
disturbing it was

00:51:24.780 --> 00:51:28.390
in terms of all of those
stereotypes across so

00:51:28.390 --> 00:51:29.820
many different cultures.

00:51:29.820 --> 00:51:33.490
Women are looking for older
guys who have lots of money,

00:51:33.490 --> 00:51:36.300
and men are looking for
younger women with big hips

00:51:36.300 --> 00:51:37.390
or who knows what.

00:51:37.390 --> 00:51:40.470
And this came through
in every single culture.

00:51:40.470 --> 00:51:42.710
But what everybody
always misses when

00:51:42.710 --> 00:51:45.900
they discuss this study
was one additional one.

00:51:45.900 --> 00:51:48.400
And this is, like,
enough for, like,

00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:50.450
Hallmark cards-- all of that.

00:51:50.450 --> 00:51:53.280
What everybody knows is,
across these cultures,

00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:55.750
these traits were more
likely to be rated

00:51:55.750 --> 00:51:58.240
highly by one sex
versus the other,

00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:01.620
but in every single one of
the countries, what you find

00:52:01.620 --> 00:52:05.100
is both sexes had an equal
preference for the number

00:52:05.100 --> 00:52:08.270
one thing on the list, which
is winding up with somebody

00:52:08.270 --> 00:52:11.670
who's nice to them.

00:52:11.670 --> 00:52:12.180
OK.

00:52:12.180 --> 00:52:15.100
On that note,
let's take a break.

00:52:15.100 --> 00:52:17.730
We now switch to
our next second half

00:52:17.730 --> 00:52:20.110
of the course topic,
which is going to follow

00:52:20.110 --> 00:52:22.044
the exact same strategy.

00:52:22.044 --> 00:52:23.460
And where we're
shifting to, here,

00:52:23.460 --> 00:52:26.780
is going to be a whole bunch
of lectures on the large,

00:52:26.780 --> 00:52:29.030
sprawling,
interconnected subjects

00:52:29.030 --> 00:52:34.470
of aggression, violence,
competition, cooperation,

00:52:34.470 --> 00:52:35.450
empathy.

00:52:35.450 --> 00:52:38.080
And what we will be
doing there is wrestling

00:52:38.080 --> 00:52:42.440
with all sorts of features
of the complexities of these

00:52:42.440 --> 00:52:44.690
and where the
underlying biology is--

00:52:44.690 --> 00:52:48.180
enormously important
social implications,

00:52:48.180 --> 00:52:49.780
in a lot of these cases.

00:52:49.780 --> 00:52:52.000
And, of course, what we
need to start off with

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:54.410
is, what's the behavior about?

00:52:54.410 --> 00:52:56.980
How objectively do you
describe these things?

00:52:56.980 --> 00:53:00.160
And it struck me-- a good way of
starting that, not only giving

00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:03.540
a sense of the range of
what aggression can be like,

00:53:03.540 --> 00:53:07.210
but also a very important point
that's going to come through

00:53:07.210 --> 00:53:09.700
in this entire lecture-- it
struck me that a good thing

00:53:09.700 --> 00:53:13.760
to be would be to describe a
relatively recent exposure I

00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:15.370
had to human aggression.

00:53:15.370 --> 00:53:18.860
Which was me being
aggressive to somebody else.

00:53:18.860 --> 00:53:20.890
This was, now, a
couple of years ago,

00:53:20.890 --> 00:53:22.730
before my back
disintegrated on me.

00:53:22.730 --> 00:53:25.320
I used to play soccer
two, three times a week.

00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:28.050
And I had been doing
this for decades.

00:53:28.050 --> 00:53:32.070
And I'm actually
totally lousy at soccer.

00:53:32.070 --> 00:53:35.560
And, like, I'm short
and I'm old and I'm not

00:53:35.560 --> 00:53:36.890
particularly coordinated.

00:53:36.890 --> 00:53:38.800
And [INAUDIBLE].

00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:41.300
So this has never
been something that

00:53:41.300 --> 00:53:44.330
was, like, one of the things I
was going to go to the Olympics

00:53:44.330 --> 00:53:44.880
with.

00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:47.870
So, a number of years ago,
there was consistently

00:53:47.870 --> 00:53:49.690
this one guy who seemed
to always wind up

00:53:49.690 --> 00:53:52.380
on the other side, and who
somehow always wound up

00:53:52.380 --> 00:53:56.040
guarding me, who was a
total son of a bitch.

00:53:56.040 --> 00:53:59.710
This guy, he was-- he was
a lot younger than me,

00:53:59.710 --> 00:54:02.330
and he was a lot more athletic,
and he was a lot taller

00:54:02.330 --> 00:54:04.660
than me, and he was a lot
more skillful in this game.

00:54:04.660 --> 00:54:08.150
And, on top of everything else,
he was a really dirty player.

00:54:08.150 --> 00:54:09.737
And this was driving me crazy.

00:54:09.737 --> 00:54:11.320
Every time the ball
would get near me,

00:54:11.320 --> 00:54:14.050
he would elbow me in my ear,
and he would do something like--

00:54:14.050 --> 00:54:14.550
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:14.550 --> 00:54:16.133
--that he wasn't
supposed to be doing.

00:54:16.133 --> 00:54:16.870
That sort.

00:54:16.870 --> 00:54:20.100
And one day, we
were out playing,

00:54:20.100 --> 00:54:22.900
and somebody passed
the ball to me.

00:54:22.900 --> 00:54:24.840
And, as per usual,
he effortlessly

00:54:24.840 --> 00:54:28.030
knocked me out of the way--
crudely and illegally,

00:54:28.030 --> 00:54:30.600
which no one seemed to notice--
and then stole the ball.

00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:33.100
And I was pissed.

00:54:33.100 --> 00:54:36.960
And this guy quickly
passed it to someone else.

00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:39.270
And the two of us
were sort of running

00:54:39.270 --> 00:54:40.750
towards a corner of the field.

00:54:40.750 --> 00:54:42.870
And momentum was carrying us.

00:54:42.870 --> 00:54:46.210
And I sort of realized
that the ball was now

00:54:46.210 --> 00:54:49.630
kind of elsewhere in the field,
and thus everybody's attention

00:54:49.630 --> 00:54:51.840
was kind of elsewhere
in the field.

00:54:51.840 --> 00:54:54.480
So we're running along, and I'm,
like, a half step behind him,

00:54:54.480 --> 00:54:57.040
and I just stick my foot
in front of his ankle

00:54:57.040 --> 00:54:58.494
and send him rolling and--

00:54:58.494 --> 00:54:59.910
[LAUGHTER AND SCATTERED
 APPLAUSE]

00:54:59.910 --> 00:55:03.190
--sprawling, and this
was the best-- heaven.

00:55:03.190 --> 00:55:04.590
This was during the summer.

00:55:04.590 --> 00:55:06.780
And it turned out there
was a mud hole there.

00:55:06.780 --> 00:55:08.910
It hadn't rained in six months.

00:55:08.910 --> 00:55:10.550
This was wonderful!

00:55:10.550 --> 00:55:13.880
So he goes-- and I didn't even
go through the pretense of, oh,

00:55:13.880 --> 00:55:14.660
are you OK?

00:55:14.660 --> 00:55:15.540
Sorry about that.

00:55:15.540 --> 00:55:17.015
It was just-- yeah!

00:55:17.015 --> 00:55:18.990
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:18.990 --> 00:55:21.870
I had to restrain
myself from ripping

00:55:21.870 --> 00:55:24.790
his stomach open with my
canines, at that point.

00:55:24.790 --> 00:55:26.797
So I felt wonderful!

00:55:26.797 --> 00:55:28.255
This was, like,
the best thing that

00:55:28.255 --> 00:55:29.620
had happened to me in months.

00:55:29.620 --> 00:55:32.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:32.680 --> 00:55:34.570
Nelson Mandela.

00:55:34.570 --> 00:55:35.950
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:35.950 --> 00:55:37.360
Nelson Mandela.

00:55:37.360 --> 00:55:41.750
Now in his 92nd
year, frail-- frail.

00:55:41.750 --> 00:55:45.380
An icon of all that is good
and wonderful about humans.

00:55:45.380 --> 00:55:47.470
This man on his last legs, now.

00:55:47.470 --> 00:55:50.700
What if I had been playing
soccer with Nelson Mandela

00:55:50.700 --> 00:55:52.500
and I did that to him?

00:55:52.500 --> 00:55:54.470
You'd be horrified!

00:55:54.470 --> 00:55:57.890
Nobody would be on the edge of
applauding that sort of thing.

00:55:57.890 --> 00:56:00.120
This would be
unspeakable, if I had

00:56:00.120 --> 00:56:03.880
done that to delightful
Nelson Mandela at age 92.

00:56:03.880 --> 00:56:07.230
So what we see here is
a very important thing

00:56:07.230 --> 00:56:09.860
that is going to run
through all of this topic.

00:56:09.860 --> 00:56:14.550
Which is, very little about
the social, the environmental,

00:56:14.550 --> 00:56:17.450
the learning aspects
of aggression

00:56:17.450 --> 00:56:21.080
have to do with learning
how to be aggressive.

00:56:21.080 --> 00:56:23.130
It's all about when.

00:56:23.130 --> 00:56:27.250
It's all about the appropriate
social context for it.

00:56:27.250 --> 00:56:29.340
Because that speaks
to something that

00:56:29.340 --> 00:56:32.850
is absolutely clear
for 99.9% of us.

00:56:32.850 --> 00:56:35.610
We do not want a world
without violence.

00:56:35.610 --> 00:56:37.760
We love violence.

00:56:37.760 --> 00:56:39.530
We get excited by it.

00:56:39.530 --> 00:56:42.550
We will pay good money
to see the right displays

00:56:42.550 --> 00:56:43.990
of competitive violence.

00:56:43.990 --> 00:56:46.130
We will barely
restrain ourselves

00:56:46.130 --> 00:56:47.750
from leaping in and joining it.

00:56:47.750 --> 00:56:50.190
It is all so wonderful
and exciting.

00:56:50.190 --> 00:56:53.660
We love violence-- when
it's the right kind.

00:56:53.660 --> 00:56:56.000
When it's in the right context.

00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:58.160
And a huge percentage
of wrestling

00:56:58.160 --> 00:57:01.390
with this is built around the
fact that, in some settings,

00:57:01.390 --> 00:57:06.010
the exact same behavior gets
you medals, gets you promotions,

00:57:06.010 --> 00:57:08.620
gets you differential
reproductive success.

00:57:08.620 --> 00:57:12.210
And the exact same patterns of
what you do with your muscles

00:57:12.210 --> 00:57:15.250
in another setting is some
of the worst things you could

00:57:15.250 --> 00:57:16.840
do as a human to another human.

00:57:16.840 --> 00:57:18.850
And it's the same behavior.

00:57:18.850 --> 00:57:21.010
And what we're going to
be wrestling with, over

00:57:21.010 --> 00:57:23.880
and over and over, in the
subject, as we march back,

00:57:23.880 --> 00:57:28.770
here, is this whole issue of,
very little about the biology

00:57:28.770 --> 00:57:31.900
of violence,
competition, all of that,

00:57:31.900 --> 00:57:34.620
is about how to
do the behaviors.

00:57:34.620 --> 00:57:37.560
It is all about
appropriate context.

00:57:37.560 --> 00:57:39.340
And what we will
see is, all sorts

00:57:39.340 --> 00:57:41.950
of realms of neurological
diseases, where things

00:57:41.950 --> 00:57:46.820
go majorly wrong, in terms
of control against violence--

00:57:46.820 --> 00:57:50.570
very rarely will it be that it's
the magnitude of violence which

00:57:50.570 --> 00:57:51.300
is wrong.

00:57:51.300 --> 00:57:53.920
What you see is, it's
in the wrong context.

00:57:53.920 --> 00:57:56.500
Because if it's done
right we love it,

00:57:56.500 --> 00:57:58.870
and we elect people who
have been good at it,

00:57:58.870 --> 00:58:02.280
and we differentially mate with
them, and we pay to see it.

00:58:02.280 --> 00:58:04.270
It's got to be in
the right setting.

00:58:04.270 --> 00:58:07.510
There are very few of us who
viscerally are truly, truly

00:58:07.510 --> 00:58:10.100
pacifists, all across the board.

00:58:10.100 --> 00:58:13.570
We just don't like violence
in certain settings.

00:58:13.570 --> 00:58:15.240
So that will be part
of the challenge,

00:58:15.240 --> 00:58:18.930
here-- making sense of the
biology of social context.

00:58:18.930 --> 00:58:20.410
And we've already
gotten some hints

00:58:20.410 --> 00:58:23.140
about that in the last topic.

00:58:23.140 --> 00:58:26.270
So, of course, what we
have to start off with

00:58:26.270 --> 00:58:27.450
is, like, definitions.

00:58:27.450 --> 00:58:29.250
And it's never
more in this realm

00:58:29.250 --> 00:58:31.320
that you get the "I don't
know how to define it,

00:58:31.320 --> 00:58:32.820
but I know it when
I see it" sort

00:58:32.820 --> 00:58:35.930
of notion in dealing with terms
for aggression and violence.

00:58:35.930 --> 00:58:38.190
Probably a great
starting point is,

00:58:38.190 --> 00:58:40.860
just as with the
sexual-behavior subject,

00:58:40.860 --> 00:58:43.600
starting off with,
well, what aspects

00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:47.520
of violence and aggression
are unique to humans?

00:58:47.520 --> 00:58:51.210
And what the theme has been
there, for decades now,

00:58:51.210 --> 00:58:54.580
is all sorts of domains that
used to be thought to be

00:58:54.580 --> 00:58:57.400
unique to humans no longer are.

00:58:57.400 --> 00:58:59.220
We've already heard
some of these examples,

00:58:59.220 --> 00:59:01.940
way back in the
sociobiology lectures--

00:59:01.940 --> 00:59:05.230
all of those wildlife films
where, somewhere in there,

00:59:05.230 --> 00:59:09.190
somebody with a very deep voice
has to intone about how "only

00:59:09.190 --> 00:59:13.090
man kills for pleasure"-- while
watching some beasts throwing

00:59:13.090 --> 00:59:14.950
the old wildebeest
into the river, there,

00:59:14.950 --> 00:59:16.290
and misinterpreting it.

00:59:16.290 --> 00:59:18.350
And that was always
the theme-- we're

00:59:18.350 --> 00:59:20.590
the only species that kills.

00:59:20.590 --> 00:59:23.300
And that went down the
tubes, way back when,

00:59:23.300 --> 00:59:27.720
as soon as people started
seeing competitive infanticide.

00:59:27.720 --> 00:59:29.700
That was first seen--
again, I think I

00:59:29.700 --> 00:59:31.760
mentioned-- in langur monkeys.

00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:34.015
A primatologist
named Sara Hrdy, who

00:59:34.015 --> 00:59:35.760
was at Harvard at
the time-- and she

00:59:35.760 --> 00:59:37.230
was the first to report this.

00:59:37.230 --> 00:59:39.440
And-- this could not be!

00:59:39.440 --> 00:59:42.940
That male langur monkeys
were killing babies?

00:59:42.940 --> 00:59:44.010
This was impossible.

00:59:44.010 --> 00:59:48.220
And the interpretation was that
this was a psychopathology.

00:59:48.220 --> 00:59:51.850
This was because of increasing
habitat degradation,

00:59:51.850 --> 00:59:55.480
human populations getting
closer, crowding them in.

00:59:55.480 --> 00:59:58.220
These were populations
of langur monkeys

00:59:58.220 --> 01:00:01.170
in some urban areas in India,
where she was studying them.

01:00:01.170 --> 01:00:05.800
This is not normal, because
no other species kills.

01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:08.350
And now that it's up to
20, 25 different species

01:00:08.350 --> 01:00:11.010
or so that does
competitive infanticide,

01:00:11.010 --> 01:00:14.420
it is quite clear we are not
the only species that kills.

01:00:14.420 --> 01:00:16.070
And we are not the
only species that

01:00:16.070 --> 01:00:21.120
kills in some premeditated,
strategic, Machiavellian,

01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:24.520
good for numbers of copies
of our genes kind of way.

01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:27.770
We are not the only
ones-- Jane Goodall

01:00:27.770 --> 01:00:31.850
by now having documented lots
and lots of cases of murder

01:00:31.850 --> 01:00:35.470
between chimps, females
killing each other's babies,

01:00:35.470 --> 01:00:38.410
males killing other
males quite frequently.

01:00:38.410 --> 01:00:41.630
And, once again, we are
not the only species.

01:00:41.630 --> 01:00:43.980
What's also become clear
from more recent work

01:00:43.980 --> 01:00:46.550
with chimpanzees is,
we're not the only species

01:00:46.550 --> 01:00:48.320
that makes weapons.

01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:52.170
Chimps have now been observed
to take large, heavy branches

01:00:52.170 --> 01:00:55.250
and break off the
ancillary branches,

01:00:55.250 --> 01:00:57.820
there, and smooth it out
and use it as a weapon,

01:00:57.820 --> 01:00:59.750
to try to hit another animal.

01:00:59.750 --> 01:01:03.630
This is tool use
and tool production.

01:01:03.630 --> 01:01:06.500
This is another species
making a weapon.

01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:10.900
We are also not the only species
that has organized violence.

01:01:10.900 --> 01:01:13.200
And this is back,
again, to chimps.

01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:15.490
Something mentioned way
back when in the lectures--

01:01:15.490 --> 01:01:18.740
the facts that chimps
are female-exogamous,

01:01:18.740 --> 01:01:20.650
that business that,
at puberty, it's

01:01:20.650 --> 01:01:23.930
the females who pick up and
move to a different group.

01:01:23.930 --> 01:01:26.910
All of the adult
males in a chimp group

01:01:26.910 --> 01:01:29.700
are relatively
related to each other.

01:01:29.700 --> 01:01:31.230
They are relatives.

01:01:31.230 --> 01:01:35.120
And what you get, then,
is cooperative aggression

01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:37.800
among males from a
particular group.

01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:40.900
What you will see
is border patrols.

01:01:40.900 --> 01:01:44.290
Goodall was the first to use
this term to describe it.

01:01:44.290 --> 01:01:46.000
You will get-- the
males of the group

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.960
will get into an
extremely agitated state

01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:52.680
with each other-- a state
of emotional contagion,

01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:57.940
where they build up this very
high level of excitation.

01:01:57.940 --> 01:02:02.300
And they then go and patrol the
territory between their group

01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:04.130
and the next group over.

01:02:04.130 --> 01:02:06.910
And what Goodall was the
first to document was,

01:02:06.910 --> 01:02:09.500
if they encounter a male
from the other group,

01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:11.160
they will kill him.

01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:16.250
And what she also documented was
cases of groups of male chimps

01:02:16.250 --> 01:02:20.560
systematically killing all of
the males of the neighboring

01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:21.610
group.

01:02:21.610 --> 01:02:24.740
What is it that we've just
seen, now, in another species?

01:02:24.740 --> 01:02:28.970
Genocide-- the notion of killing
an individual not because

01:02:28.970 --> 01:02:33.240
of who they are but because of
what group, what population,

01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:35.670
they belong to, as
part of a desire

01:02:35.670 --> 01:02:38.760
to eradicate a
population as a whole.

01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:41.240
We are not the only
species that has

01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:45.920
something resembling genocide,
if it's termed that way.

01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:49.940
So where is a domain
where we might be unique?

01:02:49.940 --> 01:02:52.450
Lots of people still
argue that humans

01:02:52.450 --> 01:02:55.940
are the only species that
psychopathologically confuse

01:02:55.940 --> 01:02:59.960
sexual behavior with aggressive
behavior-- world of sadism

01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:01.750
and masochism and all of that.

01:03:01.750 --> 01:03:03.930
That appears to be
something resembling

01:03:03.930 --> 01:03:06.920
a human-unique trait.

01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:07.560
OK.

01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:10.460
Now flipping to the more
cheerful side of things--

01:03:10.460 --> 01:03:12.730
the cooperation,
the empathy stuff--

01:03:12.730 --> 01:03:16.760
what aspects of those
behaviors are unique to humans?

01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:18.220
And what people
used to think was

01:03:18.220 --> 01:03:21.096
an exclusively human
ability-- yeah?

01:03:21.096 --> 01:03:25.082
Are there any instances where
certain troops of monkeys

01:03:25.082 --> 01:03:27.526
will not only just kill all
the males in a different troop

01:03:27.526 --> 01:03:29.986
but kill all females
and infants, too,

01:03:29.986 --> 01:03:31.960
as in [INAUDIBLE] genocide?

01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:32.490
Yeah.

01:03:32.490 --> 01:03:35.420
They will kill the infants,
out of competitive infanticide

01:03:35.420 --> 01:03:36.050
stuff.

01:03:36.050 --> 01:03:40.020
And they will then happily
hang with the females.

01:03:40.020 --> 01:03:43.640
And do more than
that, with any luck.

01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:47.290
In terms of-- oh, a very
familiar historical strategy

01:03:47.290 --> 01:03:51.100
with humans, seen
again and again.

01:03:51.100 --> 01:03:52.400
Good end of things.

01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:54.330
Used to be the rule
that the humans were

01:03:54.330 --> 01:03:58.030
the only species that
showed reconciliation-- that

01:03:58.030 --> 01:04:02.270
showed increased likelihood
of affiliative behavior

01:04:02.270 --> 01:04:05.040
between two individuals
after they have

01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:07.520
had an aggressive interaction.

01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:10.390
In the aftermath of
it, increased odds

01:04:10.390 --> 01:04:15.060
of doing something affiliative--
making up-- reconciling.

01:04:15.060 --> 01:04:16.960
Doing something
along those lines.

01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:19.390
And what has emerged
in the last 20 years

01:04:19.390 --> 01:04:24.090
or so is a huge literature
showing reconciliative behavior

01:04:24.090 --> 01:04:26.460
in a couple of
dozen other species.

01:04:26.460 --> 01:04:29.755
First person to report
this-- primatologist Frans de

01:04:29.755 --> 01:04:33.550
Waal, first reporting this
in rhesus monkeys, I believe.

01:04:33.550 --> 01:04:36.930
But lots of other species
since then, including

01:04:36.930 --> 01:04:39.310
dolphins, including whales.

01:04:39.310 --> 01:04:43.750
And what you see is-- in
the aftermath of a fight,

01:04:43.750 --> 01:04:47.840
you see two individuals are
more likely-- in gorillas,

01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:51.170
for example, to do social
grooming in the aftermath--

01:04:51.170 --> 01:04:52.560
than at any other time.

01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:56.930
An increased rate of that
happening-- reconciliation.

01:04:56.930 --> 01:05:00.620
What's remarkable is some
of the subtleties in it.

01:05:00.620 --> 01:05:04.340
And this was work that was done
by Marina Cords, at Columbia.

01:05:04.340 --> 01:05:08.320
And what she showed was,
the odds of reconciliation

01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:10.910
increase when it's
a more important,

01:05:10.910 --> 01:05:14.050
valuable relationship
that you have.

01:05:14.050 --> 01:05:16.610
How was she showing this?

01:05:16.610 --> 01:05:19.410
These were studies
with macaque monkeys.

01:05:19.410 --> 01:05:21.700
And what she did was
set up circumstances--

01:05:21.700 --> 01:05:24.970
these were animals
that were caged.

01:05:24.970 --> 01:05:27.180
And there were
circumstances where

01:05:27.180 --> 01:05:31.520
she put food on a tray outside
that could be reached for.

01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:33.900
Where, in one setting,
an animal could

01:05:33.900 --> 01:05:36.080
get the food in all on its own.

01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:37.790
And in another
setting, the only way

01:05:37.790 --> 01:05:40.570
to get the food tray
close enough to the cage

01:05:40.570 --> 01:05:42.640
was if both of them cooperated.

01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:44.890
And this was what they
were doing habitually.

01:05:44.890 --> 01:05:46.480
So what's the difference, there?

01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:48.420
In the second case,
you have formed

01:05:48.420 --> 01:05:51.780
this cooperative relationship
with this other individual.

01:05:51.780 --> 01:05:54.280
You need them, and they
need you to pull off

01:05:54.280 --> 01:05:56.590
this getting the food
close to the cage business.

01:05:56.590 --> 01:05:59.520
What she showed was
significantly higher rates

01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:01.950
of reconciliation
between pairs that

01:06:01.950 --> 01:06:04.440
have a history of cooperating.

01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:06.530
What could that
be interpreted as?

01:06:06.530 --> 01:06:09.840
More of a game-theory
history of cooperation

01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:12.210
behind you-- more
willingness to forgive.

01:06:12.210 --> 01:06:14.770
Another way of framing it,
as she does in her work,

01:06:14.770 --> 01:06:17.830
is, this is a more valuable
relationship that you

01:06:17.830 --> 01:06:19.260
don't want to screw up.

01:06:19.260 --> 01:06:22.540
You are more willing to do
something reconciliative

01:06:22.540 --> 01:06:24.200
afterward.

01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:28.330
You can see, in baboons,
reconciling behavior

01:06:28.330 --> 01:06:29.710
in females.

01:06:29.710 --> 01:06:32.370
No male baboons ever reconcile.

01:06:32.370 --> 01:06:34.690
Showing gender
differences, there.

01:06:34.690 --> 01:06:37.840
In bonobos, you
see reconciliation

01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:40.090
is different from all
these other species, where,

01:06:40.090 --> 01:06:43.314
in all the other ones, it's
built around social grooming

01:06:43.314 --> 01:06:45.770
or chimp hugs or whatever.

01:06:45.770 --> 01:06:48.710
There, of course, as you
guessed it, it's sex.

01:06:48.710 --> 01:06:50.230
Because with the
bonobos, anything

01:06:50.230 --> 01:06:52.860
that happens, and
it's time to have sex.

01:06:52.860 --> 01:06:54.730
But an interesting
thing, in terms

01:06:54.730 --> 01:06:58.940
of this picture of bonobos
being this incredibly peaceful

01:06:58.940 --> 01:07:02.810
species out there in this
commune and all of that--

01:07:02.810 --> 01:07:06.840
you can't have reconciliation
unless you have aggression.

01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:08.600
They do have aggressive
interactions.

01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:11.680
Otherwise, there would be
nothing to reconcile afterward.

01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:15.900
Even the beatific bonobos have
a certain degree of aggression--

01:07:15.900 --> 01:07:19.640
very high and varied
rates, varied abilities,

01:07:19.640 --> 01:07:23.340
to pull off reconciliative
behavior afterward.

01:07:23.340 --> 01:07:25.900
More things that used
to be just about us.

01:07:25.900 --> 01:07:27.030
Empathy.

01:07:27.030 --> 01:07:30.180
And a literature now coming
out, showing the building

01:07:30.180 --> 01:07:33.050
blocks of that in
other species, as well.

01:07:33.050 --> 01:07:38.670
First example in chimps,
second example in lab rats.

01:07:38.670 --> 01:07:39.550
Chimp example.

01:07:39.550 --> 01:07:42.280
Again, this was work
done by Frans de Waal.

01:07:42.280 --> 01:07:43.760
And wonderful study.

01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:46.270
What he showed were
two circumstances

01:07:46.270 --> 01:07:48.430
where a male chimp
would get pummeled.

01:07:48.430 --> 01:07:50.000
First circumstance.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:54.340
You've got this low-ranking
male who goes up and threatens

01:07:54.340 --> 01:07:56.550
and starts a fight with
a higher-ranking male

01:07:56.550 --> 01:07:59.330
and gets pummeled
into the ground.

01:07:59.330 --> 01:08:00.700
Second circumstance.

01:08:00.700 --> 01:08:02.100
Low-ranking guy
is sitting there,

01:08:02.100 --> 01:08:03.310
minding his own business.

01:08:03.310 --> 01:08:05.260
High-ranking guy
is in a bad mood

01:08:05.260 --> 01:08:07.430
and pummels him into the ground.

01:08:07.430 --> 01:08:08.680
What's the difference?

01:08:08.680 --> 01:08:11.760
In the first case,
this kid started it,

01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:12.985
by challenging the guy.

01:08:12.985 --> 01:08:16.750
And in the second case, he
was an innocent bystander.

01:08:16.750 --> 01:08:19.490
And what de Waal showed
is, in the half hour

01:08:19.490 --> 01:08:23.310
after these incidents, the ones
who were innocent bystanders

01:08:23.310 --> 01:08:27.300
were far more likely to be
groomed by females there

01:08:27.300 --> 01:08:29.770
in the group than the
ones who had started it.

01:08:29.770 --> 01:08:33.550
They were able to distinguish
between not just that this

01:08:33.550 --> 01:08:35.810
is an individual
who just got pounded

01:08:35.810 --> 01:08:38.819
but whether it was their
fault or not, or whether they

01:08:38.819 --> 01:08:39.890
were a victim.

01:08:39.890 --> 01:08:43.430
And considerably more grooming
when it was an individual who

01:08:43.430 --> 01:08:44.670
had been a victim.

01:08:44.670 --> 01:08:49.200
Something resembling some
proto empathy happening, there.

01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:52.779
Remarkable study, published
in Science a couple years ago.

01:08:52.779 --> 01:08:54.040
A group from McGill.

01:08:54.040 --> 01:08:58.310
And what they showed was
arguing this is something

01:08:58.310 --> 01:09:00.850
resembling empathy in rats.

01:09:00.850 --> 01:09:03.430
Here's what they
showed in the study.

01:09:03.430 --> 01:09:08.585
What they had was, they-- let's
see, how were they doing that?

01:09:08.585 --> 01:09:11.689
They would have one rat
that was restrained.

01:09:11.689 --> 01:09:13.340
And rats don't like it.

01:09:13.340 --> 01:09:17.090
And they would be giving
off ultrasonic alarm calls.

01:09:17.090 --> 01:09:19.950
Now you put a second
rat, and you give them

01:09:19.950 --> 01:09:21.890
a pain-threshold test.

01:09:21.890 --> 01:09:25.240
Which is to say, you put them
on a perfectly cool surface,

01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:27.149
and you begin to
warm it up, and you

01:09:27.149 --> 01:09:29.520
see at what temperature
do they first

01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:31.224
lift up one of their paws.

01:09:31.224 --> 01:09:32.890
And, quick, take them
off at that point.

01:09:32.890 --> 01:09:35.069
And what is their
temperature threshold

01:09:35.069 --> 01:09:37.540
for beginning to
find this aversive?

01:09:37.540 --> 01:09:42.310
And what they showed was that
rats would have a lowered

01:09:42.310 --> 01:09:45.290
threshold, would be more
sensitive to this pain

01:09:45.290 --> 01:09:48.689
stimulus, if they were next
door to another rat giving off

01:09:48.689 --> 01:09:51.410
alarm vocalizations.

01:09:51.410 --> 01:09:53.490
But it was more
subtle than that.

01:09:53.490 --> 01:09:57.260
That would be easily described
in terms of, OK, alarm calls,

01:09:57.260 --> 01:10:00.600
and stressful, and just putting
me in a more agitated state.

01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:04.410
What they showed was,
this only worked when it

01:10:04.410 --> 01:10:06.460
was rats that were cagemates.

01:10:06.460 --> 01:10:09.010
If it's rats that knew
each other, hearing

01:10:09.010 --> 01:10:13.100
the other rat in distress made
you more sensitive to a pain

01:10:13.100 --> 01:10:14.060
stimulus.

01:10:14.060 --> 01:10:18.035
If it was a strange rat,
it didn't work at all.

01:10:18.035 --> 01:10:21.920
Some crude version of something
resembling empathy, there.

01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:24.680
So we're not the
only species with it.

01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:28.850
What's clear, though, is we
are the only species that

01:10:28.850 --> 01:10:30.900
could take it to
just domains that

01:10:30.900 --> 01:10:32.830
are utterly unrecognizable.

01:10:32.830 --> 01:10:35.180
We are the only
species that is moved

01:10:35.180 --> 01:10:37.760
by people on the other side
of the planet who have just

01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:39.440
been in some catastrophe.

01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:44.400
We are the only species moved by
artwork that depicts suffering,

01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:48.440
by movie characters, by
fictional characters in books.

01:10:48.440 --> 01:10:51.780
We are taken into realms
that are unmatched elsewhere.

01:10:51.780 --> 01:10:53.680
There's this wonderful video.

01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:56.990
This was an
advertisement for Ikea.

01:10:56.990 --> 01:11:00.996
Has anyone seen this one, where
the light gets thrown out?

01:11:00.996 --> 01:11:03.680
Is there anyone
who hasn't seen it?

01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:07.260
OK, this is-- opens up.

01:11:07.260 --> 01:11:11.920
It's this stormy, like,
dismal, drizzling night, there.

01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:13.510
And it's clearly freezing.

01:11:13.510 --> 01:11:15.400
And you see-- coming
into an apartment,

01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:17.960
you see an old
lamp sitting there,

01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:20.492
with sort of a
neck-type lamp thing.

01:11:20.492 --> 01:11:21.450
And it's sitting there.

01:11:21.450 --> 01:11:24.660
And suddenly this person
appears, picks it up,

01:11:24.660 --> 01:11:28.150
and walks outside into
the rain and puts it

01:11:28.150 --> 01:11:30.370
down next to the garbage can.

01:11:30.370 --> 01:11:30.900
Oh!

01:11:30.900 --> 01:11:32.310
It's being thrown out.

01:11:32.310 --> 01:11:35.750
And now, thanks to brilliant
photography and angles

01:11:35.750 --> 01:11:38.200
that are shot just
underneath the lamp,

01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:41.540
there, you see it leaning there,
looking miserable in the rain

01:11:41.540 --> 01:11:43.490
and all alone with its
light thing, there.

01:11:43.490 --> 01:11:45.770
And you see, from this
angle in the background,

01:11:45.770 --> 01:11:47.490
there's the
apartment, where it's

01:11:47.490 --> 01:11:49.720
warm-- lights, and all of that.

01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:52.370
And then you see the
most heartbreaking thing.

01:11:52.370 --> 01:11:55.670
You see the person come by the
window, there-- the armchair--

01:11:55.670 --> 01:12:00.290
and put down a new lamp--
a new lamp that's nicer.

01:12:00.290 --> 01:12:03.490
And they even show the person--
just to really get the edge,

01:12:03.490 --> 01:12:06.170
there-- briefly
caressing the new lamp.

01:12:06.170 --> 01:12:08.850
And then you get a shot
back out again in the dark,

01:12:08.850 --> 01:12:11.050
and it's pouring, and
it's drizzling out.

01:12:11.050 --> 01:12:13.300
And you're sitting
there, feeling terrible

01:12:13.300 --> 01:12:14.980
for this damned lamp, there.

01:12:14.980 --> 01:12:16.370
How does this work?

01:12:16.370 --> 01:12:19.250
And then, just to sort of
show it, suddenly this person

01:12:19.250 --> 01:12:21.560
appears in the screen
and says, in effect,

01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:22.820
what's wrong with you?

01:12:22.820 --> 01:12:24.010
It's a lamp.

01:12:24.010 --> 01:12:26.910
It's a lamp, and the
new one works better.

01:12:26.910 --> 01:12:29.890
And then on comes
"Ikea," which I suspect

01:12:29.890 --> 01:12:32.400
is not actually a good strategy,
because you think of them

01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:35.260
as heartless
individuals who advocate

01:12:35.260 --> 01:12:37.810
the abandonment of child lamps.

01:12:37.810 --> 01:12:41.192
But, like, no hippo
would know what

01:12:41.192 --> 01:12:43.400
the deal is, while you're
sitting there feeling sorry

01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:45.270
for this piece of metal, there.

01:12:45.270 --> 01:12:48.650
We have empathy--
not the only species,

01:12:48.650 --> 01:12:52.180
but in very distinct
and unique realms.

01:12:52.180 --> 01:12:53.780
What else?

01:12:53.780 --> 01:12:56.030
We are ostensibly
the only species

01:12:56.030 --> 01:12:57.810
with a sense of justice.

01:12:57.810 --> 01:13:01.070
Again, that's not
necessarily the case.

01:13:01.070 --> 01:13:04.320
Again, work by Frans de Waal,
whose name keeps coming up,

01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:07.600
who is one of the best,
most creative primatologists

01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:08.640
in the universe.

01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:13.000
This is work, now, where, again,
chimps-- two chimps-- where

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:14.850
circumstances were,
either it takes

01:13:14.850 --> 01:13:17.660
one of them to pull
a tray of food over,

01:13:17.660 --> 01:13:21.080
or both of them to cooperate
in order to get the food.

01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:24.140
And what he shows is, after
the cooperative relationship

01:13:24.140 --> 01:13:26.080
has been established
with them, if you

01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:29.540
change the workings of it
that it requires both of them

01:13:29.540 --> 01:13:32.170
to pull the food in
but the food winds

01:13:32.170 --> 01:13:34.740
up going to only
one of the chimps,

01:13:34.740 --> 01:13:37.010
that champ is more
likely to share

01:13:37.010 --> 01:13:39.260
the food with the
other individual

01:13:39.260 --> 01:13:42.600
than if they didn't have a
working-together relationship.

01:13:42.600 --> 01:13:46.030
That chimp, on some Frans
de Waal sort of level,

01:13:46.030 --> 01:13:49.900
was feeling bad for the other
guy getting a rotten deal.

01:13:49.900 --> 01:13:53.030
Under those circumstances, if
it was a chimp that you already

01:13:53.030 --> 01:13:55.800
had a cooperative
relationship with,

01:13:55.800 --> 01:13:57.730
you were more likely
to share with them

01:13:57.730 --> 01:14:01.940
after they had gotten something
aversive occur to them.

01:14:01.940 --> 01:14:03.260
What else?

01:14:03.260 --> 01:14:06.480
What else, in terms of making
sense of other species--

01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:08.260
what are unique, what are not?

01:14:08.260 --> 01:14:10.470
Dominance hierarchies.

01:14:10.470 --> 01:14:13.580
And if you come from a
certain school of sociology,

01:14:13.580 --> 01:14:17.160
humans are the least
hierarchical species out there.

01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:20.470
We are not territorial, in the
sense of lots of other species.

01:14:20.470 --> 01:14:22.500
We do not have
strict hierarchies.

01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:24.280
And what you see
in other species

01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:27.220
are hierarchies can mean
very different things.

01:14:27.220 --> 01:14:29.420
And the broad
dichotomy that's made

01:14:29.420 --> 01:14:33.740
is between top-down
hierarchies and bottom-up ones.

01:14:33.740 --> 01:14:38.090
Top-down, you have a single,
dominating, most aggressive

01:14:38.090 --> 01:14:40.220
individual who is
up there on top.

01:14:40.220 --> 01:14:42.280
And the characteristic
of this-- it's also

01:14:42.280 --> 01:14:45.390
called a "despotic"
hierarchy-- is

01:14:45.390 --> 01:14:49.620
extremely unequal
distribution of resources

01:14:49.620 --> 01:14:54.220
enforced by violence or
threats of violence from above.

01:14:54.220 --> 01:14:55.490
That's baboons.

01:14:55.490 --> 01:14:56.700
That's chimps.

01:14:56.700 --> 01:14:58.350
That's rhesus monkeys.

01:14:58.350 --> 01:15:00.680
Then you look at
vervet monkeys, and you

01:15:00.680 --> 01:15:04.200
see a bottom-up, what is
also termed "egalitarian,"

01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:05.200
hierarchy.

01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:09.020
There is a hierarchy, but the
number one individual there

01:15:09.020 --> 01:15:12.230
is only there with the
cooperation of everyone else.

01:15:12.230 --> 01:15:15.850
If that individual becomes
abusive, they are overthrown.

01:15:15.850 --> 01:15:18.300
So hierarchy does
not, in other species,

01:15:18.300 --> 01:15:22.700
automatically mean abusive,
aggressive, dominating,

01:15:22.700 --> 01:15:24.730
unequal-distribution stuff.

01:15:24.730 --> 01:15:28.020
What it is is, it
varies by species.

01:15:28.020 --> 01:15:29.890
What also becomes clear,
by the time you're

01:15:29.890 --> 01:15:32.410
looking at other
species, is it gets

01:15:32.410 --> 01:15:36.590
really hard to figure out what
does indeed count as violence.

01:15:36.590 --> 01:15:41.280
Example-- East African primate
called a "patas" monkey.

01:15:41.280 --> 01:15:44.650
Go and study patas
monkeys, and spend 40, 50,

01:15:44.650 --> 01:15:47.050
60 years doing it,
and what you will see

01:15:47.050 --> 01:15:50.760
are virtually no instances
of male patas monkeys

01:15:50.760 --> 01:15:53.320
having fights with each other.

01:15:53.320 --> 01:15:54.110
Wow!

01:15:54.110 --> 01:15:55.810
That's a pretty
unaggressive species.

01:15:55.810 --> 01:15:57.280
That's kind of nice.

01:15:57.280 --> 01:16:00.060
Put two male patas
monkeys in a cage,

01:16:00.060 --> 01:16:03.340
and not only will they start
fighting soon afterward,

01:16:03.340 --> 01:16:05.440
they will fight to the death.

01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:10.990
Because they have no signals
of terminating aggression.

01:16:10.990 --> 01:16:12.940
What's the deal with that?

01:16:12.940 --> 01:16:17.190
This is a species where the
level of male-male tension

01:16:17.190 --> 01:16:19.990
and male-male
aggression is so high

01:16:19.990 --> 01:16:22.870
that the entire social
structure of these species

01:16:22.870 --> 01:16:26.460
are built around keeping males
as far apart as possible.

01:16:26.460 --> 01:16:28.510
You don't see male
patas monkeys having

01:16:28.510 --> 01:16:30.690
fights, not because
they're not aggressive

01:16:30.690 --> 01:16:33.880
but because they live in
these dispersed patterns.

01:16:33.880 --> 01:16:36.590
So is this an aggressive
species, or not?

01:16:36.590 --> 01:16:39.360
This isn't an aggressive
species; you never see a fight.

01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:41.590
This is an insanely
aggressive species;

01:16:41.590 --> 01:16:43.660
the central feature of
their social structure

01:16:43.660 --> 01:16:46.760
is keeping violent males
away from each other.

01:16:46.760 --> 01:16:47.980
What does it count as?

01:16:47.980 --> 01:16:50.660
What does it count as
when you see an animal

01:16:50.660 --> 01:16:54.230
leap on top of another
animal and rip it to shreds?

01:16:54.230 --> 01:16:56.320
Sometimes that's
aggression, sometimes

01:16:56.320 --> 01:16:57.800
that's getting dinner.

01:16:57.800 --> 01:17:00.660
Once again, as with the
sexual-behavior realm--

01:17:00.660 --> 01:17:04.760
this whole realm, back
to the limbic anatomy of,

01:17:04.760 --> 01:17:06.320
are you looking at aggression?

01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:07.970
Are you looking at predation?

01:17:07.970 --> 01:17:10.830
These are totally different
biological phenomena.

01:17:10.830 --> 01:17:12.150
That takes some work.

01:17:12.150 --> 01:17:14.710
What has always been
one of the big questions

01:17:14.710 --> 01:17:17.040
in the field is,
so, what's the deal

01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:19.190
with rough-and-tumble play?

01:17:19.190 --> 01:17:20.440
What's play about?

01:17:20.440 --> 01:17:23.470
Because you see it in
endless species out there.

01:17:23.470 --> 01:17:26.320
A lot of studies show that
during periods of famine,

01:17:26.320 --> 01:17:28.760
for example, one of
the last behaviors that

01:17:28.760 --> 01:17:31.060
disappears from kids is play.

01:17:31.060 --> 01:17:34.270
It is really, really
hard-wired in there.

01:17:34.270 --> 01:17:38.210
So when you see aggressive
play, is this truly aggression,

01:17:38.210 --> 01:17:41.090
or is this practicing
the building blocks

01:17:41.090 --> 01:17:44.080
for the real stuff that
will come later on?

01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:45.760
What a lot of the
primate studies

01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:49.090
suggest is, it's not
practice, it's not play,

01:17:49.090 --> 01:17:52.510
it's already establishing
some of the asymmetries that

01:17:52.510 --> 01:17:55.160
will be there later in life.

01:17:55.160 --> 01:17:55.820
OK.

01:17:55.820 --> 01:17:58.670
So, all sorts of ways
in which aggression

01:17:58.670 --> 01:18:01.530
can pop up in other species,
in unexpected realms,

01:18:01.530 --> 01:18:03.840
in which cooperation,
all sorts of things

01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:07.510
like that-- what are some
of the unique human ones?

01:18:07.510 --> 01:18:09.800
Nonetheless, amid all
those similarities,

01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:13.490
we do things that are
completely unprecedented.

01:18:13.490 --> 01:18:15.780
We are perfectly
capable of being

01:18:15.780 --> 01:18:18.920
as violent as a chimp, when
it comes to cudgeling somebody

01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:19.850
over the head.

01:18:19.850 --> 01:18:22.100
But we're the only
species that could

01:18:22.100 --> 01:18:25.500
be violent by doing nothing
more physically taxing then

01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:30.330
pulling a trigger or looking
the other away or releasing

01:18:30.330 --> 01:18:33.080
a bomb from 30,000
feet up in the air

01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:38.560
or being passive-aggressive
or damning with faint praise.

01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:41.550
And we're suddenly doing
all sorts of much more

01:18:41.550 --> 01:18:43.490
subtle things with aggression.

01:18:43.490 --> 01:18:46.730
Here's three examples
of human aggression--

01:18:46.730 --> 01:18:48.970
and I've heard
about-- which shows

01:18:48.970 --> 01:18:52.720
just how complex of a
phenomenon this could be.

01:18:52.720 --> 01:18:54.230
First one.

01:18:54.230 --> 01:18:56.000
This was the child
of a friend of mine,

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:57.870
when she was about
five years old

01:18:57.870 --> 01:19:00.550
and she was in kindergarten
or pre-K or something.

01:19:00.550 --> 01:19:02.880
And there was another kid
there that she was not

01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:04.000
getting along with.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:07.540
And this was around Easter, and
they were painting Easter eggs.

01:19:07.540 --> 01:19:10.100
And some tussle came
up between them.

01:19:10.100 --> 01:19:13.720
And my friend's daughter broke
the other kid's Easter egg.

01:19:13.720 --> 01:19:17.450
Tears, hysteria, teachers
swooping in to say,

01:19:17.450 --> 01:19:20.240
you're not a bad child but
you've done a bad thing,

01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:21.740
and you can't do
stuff like that.

01:19:21.740 --> 01:19:25.780
And you are going to paint a
new Easter egg, to give to her,

01:19:25.780 --> 01:19:28.630
to make up for the
one that you broke.

01:19:28.630 --> 01:19:30.970
So my friend's kid proceeds
to go to the corner

01:19:30.970 --> 01:19:33.180
with this new egg and
some paintbrushes.

01:19:33.180 --> 01:19:35.737
And what becomes apparent
after a while is she's sort of,

01:19:35.737 --> 01:19:38.320
like, looking over her shoulder
and working away on something,

01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:40.380
here, and glowering
back at everybody.

01:19:40.380 --> 01:19:42.980
And finally she comes
up to the other kid

01:19:42.980 --> 01:19:46.180
and says, here's your stupid
Easter egg, Happy Easter,

01:19:46.180 --> 01:19:49.352
and gives her an egg that
she's painted completely black.

01:19:49.352 --> 01:19:51.140
[LAUGHTER]

01:19:51.140 --> 01:19:52.210
OK.

01:19:52.210 --> 01:19:54.390
What's with the
aggression, here?

01:19:54.390 --> 01:19:57.920
Easter eggs--
pastel colors, bunny

01:19:57.920 --> 01:20:00.130
rabbits-- all that
sort of thing.

01:20:00.130 --> 01:20:04.410
Easter eggs are not supposed
to be one solid color

01:20:04.410 --> 01:20:06.650
and certainly not jet black.

01:20:06.650 --> 01:20:09.190
That's not what-- what
was she doing, here?

01:20:09.190 --> 01:20:11.850
She was cooperating with
the letter of the law

01:20:11.850 --> 01:20:14.740
while doing as much violence
to the spirit of the law as

01:20:14.740 --> 01:20:15.530
possible.

01:20:15.530 --> 01:20:18.240
What she was saying
was, she is making

01:20:18.240 --> 01:20:21.210
me paint this egg for you, and
I don't like you one bit more

01:20:21.210 --> 01:20:22.500
than 30 minutes ago.

01:20:22.500 --> 01:20:24.490
And, showing that
the other kid fully

01:20:24.490 --> 01:20:27.160
understood what this human
bit of passive-aggression

01:20:27.160 --> 01:20:32.130
was about, she burst into tears
as soon as she saw the egg.

01:20:32.130 --> 01:20:35.360
Next example of the subtlety
of human aggression.

01:20:35.360 --> 01:20:38.774
And this one involved my wife.

01:20:38.774 --> 01:20:39.273
OK.

01:20:39.273 --> 01:20:40.200
[LAUGHTER]

01:20:40.200 --> 01:20:42.090
So this was-- occasion.

01:20:42.090 --> 01:20:45.147
We were, like, driving
around somewhere-- minivan,

01:20:45.147 --> 01:20:45.730
with our kids.

01:20:45.730 --> 01:20:49.410
And some total jerk,
like, cut us off.

01:20:49.410 --> 01:20:52.800
And-- you know, he could
have killed us and our kids,

01:20:52.800 --> 01:20:54.700
and-- [GROWL OF FRUSTRATION].

01:20:54.700 --> 01:20:55.780
My wife was driving.

01:20:55.780 --> 01:20:58.050
And we sort of get past
what should logically

01:20:58.050 --> 01:21:00.590
have been about five seconds
of cursing the person.

01:21:00.590 --> 01:21:04.362
And she suddenly says,
I'm going after this guy.

01:21:04.362 --> 01:21:05.760
[LAUGHTER]

01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:08.970
And she proceeds
to trail the guy

01:21:08.970 --> 01:21:10.699
and trails him for
about two miles,

01:21:10.699 --> 01:21:12.990
while I'm sitting there
getting increasingly distressed

01:21:12.990 --> 01:21:14.430
and panicked.

01:21:14.430 --> 01:21:17.019
And eventually
he, like, realizes

01:21:17.019 --> 01:21:18.560
he's being followed
now and is taking

01:21:18.560 --> 01:21:20.050
sort of evasive maneuvers.

01:21:20.050 --> 01:21:23.130
And eventually we get
him on this street

01:21:23.130 --> 01:21:24.910
where there's a red
light, there, where

01:21:24.910 --> 01:21:26.857
there's a car in front of him.

01:21:26.857 --> 01:21:27.940
And then we're behind him.

01:21:27.940 --> 01:21:29.680
So it's not like he
could, in a panic,

01:21:29.680 --> 01:21:32.570
go through the red light, there,
because he's trapped there.

01:21:32.570 --> 01:21:34.779
And we happen to know this
was a very long red light.

01:21:34.779 --> 01:21:37.153
While I've been sitting there,
for the last five minutes,

01:21:37.153 --> 01:21:38.800
saying, um, do you
think this is really

01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:41.620
a good-- [VROOM] go
around another corner,

01:21:41.620 --> 01:21:42.650
tracking him down.

01:21:42.650 --> 01:21:43.680
So we're sitting there.

01:21:43.680 --> 01:21:46.710
And suddenly my wife says,
I'm going over there.

01:21:46.710 --> 01:21:49.290
And she grabs something from
between the seats and storms

01:21:49.290 --> 01:21:49.400
out.

01:21:49.400 --> 01:21:51.600
While I say, um, do you
really think that's a good--

01:21:51.600 --> 01:21:52.220
[LAUGHTER]

01:21:52.220 --> 01:21:52.720
She's gone.

01:21:52.720 --> 01:21:55.010
So I, like, get out,
and I run over there.

01:21:55.010 --> 01:21:57.090
And I see the window's
down in the car.

01:21:57.090 --> 01:21:59.110
And she's yelling at the guy.

01:21:59.110 --> 01:22:01.800
And she says, anybody
who could do something

01:22:01.800 --> 01:22:02.780
like that needs this.

01:22:02.780 --> 01:22:05.380
And she flings something at him.

01:22:05.380 --> 01:22:07.710
So she comes back to
the car, at that point.

01:22:07.710 --> 01:22:08.860
And the light has changed.

01:22:08.860 --> 01:22:12.680
And this guy, like,
slinks off into the--

01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:16.290
if it is possible for a car to
look sheepish, moving, like,

01:22:16.290 --> 01:22:19.010
four miles an hour, heads
off into the sunset,

01:22:19.010 --> 01:22:21.380
down this dark,
little block, there.

01:22:21.380 --> 01:22:22.660
So, sitting there.

01:22:22.660 --> 01:22:26.220
And she's milking this
for all it's worth.

01:22:26.220 --> 01:22:27.970
And turn-- what did
you put in there?

01:22:27.970 --> 01:22:31.370
And she looks totally
delighted with herself.

01:22:31.370 --> 01:22:33.620
And she's, like, euphoric.

01:22:33.620 --> 01:22:35.880
And I said, well, what
did you say to him?

01:22:35.880 --> 01:22:37.900
You-- what was
that-- and she said,

01:22:37.900 --> 01:22:40.745
anyone that could do anything
this mean needs one of these.

01:22:40.745 --> 01:22:42.120
And I said, what
did you do then?

01:22:42.120 --> 01:22:44.986
And she said, I threw
a lollipop at him.

01:22:44.986 --> 01:22:45.486
[LAUGHTER]

01:22:45.486 --> 01:22:47.210
I said, whoa!

01:22:47.210 --> 01:22:48.625
You killer, you!

01:22:48.625 --> 01:22:51.130
You-- I was so proud of her.

01:22:51.130 --> 01:22:54.570
My god, the violence
intrinsic in that!

01:22:54.570 --> 01:22:58.080
No other species would know
what was that going on, there,

01:22:58.080 --> 01:23:01.780
in terms of the intrinsic
passive-aggression

01:23:01.780 --> 01:23:04.459
and all of that.

01:23:04.459 --> 01:23:06.000
We're the only ones
who could come up

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.020
with something like that.

01:23:08.020 --> 01:23:10.550
Third example.

01:23:10.550 --> 01:23:14.220
Every day, out in
Nevada, in a town there,

01:23:14.220 --> 01:23:17.910
there are men who get
up to go off to work,

01:23:17.910 --> 01:23:20.850
and they kiss the
family goodbye.

01:23:20.850 --> 01:23:24.140
And they've got to get reminded
to pick up the dry cleaning.

01:23:24.140 --> 01:23:26.527
And they get in the car, and
they're a little bit late,

01:23:26.527 --> 01:23:28.110
and there's a lot
of traffic, and they

01:23:28.110 --> 01:23:30.250
get all stressed
about the traffic jam.

01:23:30.250 --> 01:23:32.300
But they get there
to work on time.

01:23:32.300 --> 01:23:34.290
And they're a little
bit relaxed there.

01:23:34.290 --> 01:23:35.950
And they finally can come in.

01:23:35.950 --> 01:23:38.440
And they sit down
in a chair in what

01:23:38.440 --> 01:23:42.350
is a model of the cockpit
of a fighter plane.

01:23:42.350 --> 01:23:45.570
And what they do is
control drone airplanes

01:23:45.570 --> 01:23:48.120
on the other side of
the planet, in Iraq.

01:23:48.120 --> 01:23:49.815
And they spend the
day, sitting there

01:23:49.815 --> 01:23:52.460
at their work shift,
controlling planes that

01:23:52.460 --> 01:23:56.330
release bombs and missiles
and destroy people

01:23:56.330 --> 01:23:58.450
12,000 miles away.

01:23:58.450 --> 01:24:00.240
So they spend the
entire day, sitting

01:24:00.240 --> 01:24:05.880
there in this air-conditioned
room in Nevis Air Force Base,

01:24:05.880 --> 01:24:07.540
just outside Las Vegas.

01:24:07.540 --> 01:24:09.500
And they spend the
day doing that.

01:24:09.500 --> 01:24:11.980
And at the end of the
day, they pick up,

01:24:11.980 --> 01:24:14.030
and they tell everyone
they'll see them tomorrow.

01:24:14.030 --> 01:24:16.840
And they go pick up
the dry cleaning.

01:24:16.840 --> 01:24:20.140
And they go to their little
daughter's ballet concert.

01:24:20.140 --> 01:24:23.170
And afterward they
hug her and can't

01:24:23.170 --> 01:24:25.310
believe they could love
somebody this much.

01:24:25.310 --> 01:24:27.060
And then the next
morning they go

01:24:27.060 --> 01:24:29.080
back to spending their
day killing people

01:24:29.080 --> 01:24:31.390
on the other side of the planet.

01:24:31.390 --> 01:24:33.630
There is not a whole
lot of species out there

01:24:33.630 --> 01:24:35.620
who could do that, either.

01:24:35.620 --> 01:24:37.470
So by the time
you're getting to us,

01:24:37.470 --> 01:24:42.120
we have ways of being awful to
other members of our species

01:24:42.120 --> 01:24:43.972
that are simply unmatched.

01:24:43.972 --> 01:24:47.020
And we have ways of
being empathic, as well.

01:24:47.020 --> 01:24:50.450
As we begin to wrestle,
here, with the neurobiology

01:24:50.450 --> 01:24:52.980
and endocrinology and
finally walking our way back

01:24:52.980 --> 01:24:56.630
towards the left, we're going
to have this huge problem

01:24:56.630 --> 01:25:01.310
of the context of aggression and
this even huger problem of just

01:25:01.310 --> 01:25:04.700
how complex aggression
and empathy are,

01:25:04.700 --> 01:25:06.950
when you leave it to humans.

01:25:06.950 --> 01:25:09.540
Examples at the empathy end.

01:25:09.540 --> 01:25:11.140
Human versions of it.

01:25:11.140 --> 01:25:13.630
The things we are
able to reconcile.

01:25:13.630 --> 01:25:15.830
We are a species
who has invented

01:25:15.830 --> 01:25:20.410
truth-and-reconciliation
commissions in South Africa,

01:25:20.410 --> 01:25:24.870
in the Balkans, in Rwanda,
where people face the person who

01:25:24.870 --> 01:25:29.160
did that to them, the person who
destroyed their life, destroyed

01:25:29.160 --> 01:25:30.150
their family.

01:25:30.150 --> 01:25:33.390
And going through what is by
now a fairly well-worked-out

01:25:33.390 --> 01:25:36.530
process that all sorts
of people have studied.

01:25:36.530 --> 01:25:40.720
And, in some of those cases,
there is reconciliation.

01:25:40.720 --> 01:25:43.010
There is even forgiveness.

01:25:43.010 --> 01:25:45.700
How can this possibly happen?

01:25:45.700 --> 01:25:49.240
We have a world where we
try to have individuals

01:25:49.240 --> 01:25:54.230
foster peace through the
most unlikely of rationales.

01:25:54.230 --> 01:26:00.100
I will let no man spoil my
soul by causing me to hate him.

01:26:00.100 --> 01:26:03.510
That is a psychology
that is unprecedented.

01:26:03.510 --> 01:26:09.040
We have the world of people like
this Catholic nun, Sister Helen

01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:11.780
Prejean, who has spent
her entire career

01:26:11.780 --> 01:26:14.570
ministering to the needs
of men on death row

01:26:14.570 --> 01:26:17.370
in a maximum-security
prison in Louisiana.

01:26:17.370 --> 01:26:19.580
She was the person who
was featured in the movie

01:26:19.580 --> 01:26:21.640
way back when, Dead Man Walking.

01:26:21.640 --> 01:26:24.390
And what she spent a
lot of her time doing

01:26:24.390 --> 01:26:27.180
is having incredulous
people, often

01:26:27.180 --> 01:26:29.600
the relatives of the
victims of these murderers,

01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:32.630
come up and say,
how can you do this?

01:26:32.630 --> 01:26:36.550
How could you spend your life
devoted to people like these?

01:26:36.550 --> 01:26:38.560
And she comes up
with an answer that

01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:43.130
is so definedly human, that no
other species could come near.

01:26:43.130 --> 01:26:45.720
No matter how much
they groom victims,

01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:49.760
her answer always is, the
less forgivable the act,

01:26:49.760 --> 01:26:51.730
the more it must be forgiven.

01:26:51.730 --> 01:26:56.310
The less lovable the person,
the more they must be loved.

01:26:56.310 --> 01:27:00.140
And suddenly we're in a world
that the more something cannot

01:27:00.140 --> 01:27:04.900
be, the more it must be, as
a moral sort of act to do.

01:27:04.900 --> 01:27:07.750
Whoa-- nobody out there
in the animal kingdom

01:27:07.750 --> 01:27:10.090
is going to have a
clue what we're up to.

01:27:10.090 --> 01:27:12.930
This is very complex
terrain we are

01:27:12.930 --> 01:27:15.510
going to deal with, here,
as we now shift over

01:27:15.510 --> 01:27:17.741
to the biology of it.

01:27:17.741 --> 01:27:18.240
OK.

01:27:18.240 --> 01:27:20.330
So, starting now
with our strategy--

01:27:20.330 --> 01:27:22.000
a violent act occurs.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:23.870
An empathic act occurs.

01:27:23.870 --> 01:27:25.490
Any in these categories.

01:27:25.490 --> 01:27:29.045
What was going on in the
brain, one second before?

01:27:29.045 --> 01:27:30.420
And, of course,
what do you know?

01:27:30.420 --> 01:27:32.700
We're going to immediately
going to land is,

01:27:32.700 --> 01:27:34.940
right in the middle
of the limbic system.

01:27:34.940 --> 01:27:39.530
And, just as the Kluver-Bucy
syndrome from the 1980s,

01:27:39.530 --> 01:27:42.520
as we heard about last
week-- just as that syndrome,

01:27:42.520 --> 01:27:44.480
when you destroy
the limbic system,

01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:48.390
you get completely inappropriate
sexual behavior in primates.

01:27:48.390 --> 01:27:50.260
What those studies
also showed was,

01:27:50.260 --> 01:27:53.640
you get completely inappropriate
aggressive behavior.

01:27:53.640 --> 01:27:54.520
OK.

01:27:54.520 --> 01:27:57.090
So, with 80-year-old
research, we've

01:27:57.090 --> 01:27:59.060
now landed in the limbic system.

01:27:59.060 --> 01:28:02.230
What are the subregions
that are relevant?

01:28:02.230 --> 01:28:05.030
The area that comes in
at the top of the list,

01:28:05.030 --> 01:28:08.400
immediately, that we've already
heard a fair amount about,

01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:10.210
is the amygdala.

01:28:10.210 --> 01:28:13.260
The amygdala and
its role in fear,

01:28:13.260 --> 01:28:16.410
its role in anxiety--
that strange role,

01:28:16.410 --> 01:28:18.590
in males, of sexual motivation.

01:28:18.590 --> 01:28:20.730
But what the amygdala
is most renowned for

01:28:20.730 --> 01:28:22.770
is its role in aggression.

01:28:22.770 --> 01:28:24.830
And, as I emphasized
last week, it

01:28:24.830 --> 01:28:27.700
is mighty interesting,
I think, that the part

01:28:27.700 --> 01:28:30.700
of the brain which is most
responsive to when you are

01:28:30.700 --> 01:28:32.730
scared is the part
of the brain that

01:28:32.730 --> 01:28:35.390
generates the starts
of aggressive behavior.

01:28:35.390 --> 01:28:39.710
Again, in a world in which
no neuron need be afraid,

01:28:39.710 --> 01:28:43.480
we're going to have a lot fewer
aggressive amygdalas out there.

01:28:43.480 --> 01:28:44.530
What's the evidence?

01:28:44.530 --> 01:28:46.460
You know the drill by now.

01:28:46.460 --> 01:28:49.700
You go and you destroy
the amygdala in an animal,

01:28:49.700 --> 01:28:54.400
and you are incapable of
eliciting aggression from them.

01:28:54.400 --> 01:28:57.300
You go and you do the
same thing in a human,

01:28:57.300 --> 01:28:59.630
and you get the
exact same result.

01:28:59.630 --> 01:29:02.200
One of those dark,
horrible chapters

01:29:02.200 --> 01:29:04.810
in the history of
science-- another realm

01:29:04.810 --> 01:29:08.270
of legally enforced
psychosurgery.

01:29:08.270 --> 01:29:11.410
This was a trend that
was very, very popular

01:29:11.410 --> 01:29:15.300
in the '60s and '70s--
court-ordered amygdalectomies

01:29:15.300 --> 01:29:16.510
of people.

01:29:16.510 --> 01:29:18.450
And this was a
technique where people

01:29:18.450 --> 01:29:22.620
would go in with a lesioning
syringe into each side--

01:29:22.620 --> 01:29:25.610
the amygdala is a bilateral
structure-- there's

01:29:25.610 --> 01:29:27.600
two of them, way
deep in the brain--

01:29:27.600 --> 01:29:30.540
and go in and destroy
the structure.

01:29:30.540 --> 01:29:34.020
And this would
decrease aggression.

01:29:34.020 --> 01:29:36.800
This would decrease
all sorts of stuff.

01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:40.170
This wound up on the front
page of the New York Times

01:29:40.170 --> 01:29:44.910
when, around 1970, three
neurosurgeons at Harvard

01:29:44.910 --> 01:29:48.450
wrote a letter to the New
York Times, pointing out

01:29:48.450 --> 01:29:50.810
there's this great
surgical technique

01:29:50.810 --> 01:29:52.810
which they were the
pioneers of where

01:29:52.810 --> 01:29:54.960
you could take aggressive
humans and make

01:29:54.960 --> 01:29:58.100
them less aggressive with
no other side effects.

01:29:58.100 --> 01:29:59.750
You could make them
less aggressive.

01:29:59.750 --> 01:30:03.250
And haven't you been noticing
that our inner cities have been

01:30:03.250 --> 01:30:05.390
burning and rife with violence?

01:30:05.390 --> 01:30:07.930
Maybe it's time to start
thinking about doing

01:30:07.930 --> 01:30:10.130
some of these preemptively.

01:30:10.130 --> 01:30:12.910
This was a letter
from these three guys

01:30:12.910 --> 01:30:14.680
from Harvard Med School.

01:30:14.680 --> 01:30:16.580
No surprise, not
everybody sort of

01:30:16.580 --> 01:30:19.390
thought this was the swellest
idea that they had ever heard.

01:30:19.390 --> 01:30:24.120
This generated this huge fight
over the psychosurgical use

01:30:24.120 --> 01:30:27.230
of court-enforced
amygdalectomies.

01:30:27.230 --> 01:30:30.630
And before it was over with,
it had just as bad of a history

01:30:30.630 --> 01:30:32.450
as frontal lobotomies.

01:30:32.450 --> 01:30:35.150
People subjected
to amygdalectomies

01:30:35.150 --> 01:30:40.200
because they were argumentative,
because they, as teenagers,

01:30:40.200 --> 01:30:41.780
didn't listen to their parents.

01:30:41.780 --> 01:30:43.650
They didn't listen
to their teachers.

01:30:43.650 --> 01:30:45.900
Thousands of cases of these.

01:30:45.900 --> 01:30:48.780
The one thing that was
clear was that, yes, indeed,

01:30:48.780 --> 01:30:52.070
aggressive behavior would
decrease in these individuals.

01:30:52.070 --> 01:30:55.070
There would not be a whole lot
of a person left afterward.

01:30:55.070 --> 01:30:57.390
So, lesioning evidence.

01:30:57.390 --> 01:30:58.930
Stimulation evidence.

01:30:58.930 --> 01:31:00.940
You know the flip
side of that by now.

01:31:00.940 --> 01:31:03.800
Now stick an electrode
into the rat's amygdala

01:31:03.800 --> 01:31:06.650
and stimulate, electrically
stimulate, there.

01:31:06.650 --> 01:31:11.040
And you produce wildly
aggressive behavior.

01:31:11.040 --> 01:31:14.470
And you see two equivalents
of that in humans.

01:31:14.470 --> 01:31:18.540
And in both of these
cases, stupendously rare.

01:31:18.540 --> 01:31:22.310
First is a very,
very, very rare type

01:31:22.310 --> 01:31:25.170
of epilepsy, where
what you get is

01:31:25.170 --> 01:31:28.850
the epileptic focus, the place
where the seizure begins,

01:31:28.850 --> 01:31:30.380
is in the amygdala.

01:31:30.380 --> 01:31:33.720
What you see is, with
most types of epilepsy,

01:31:33.720 --> 01:31:36.960
the place where it starts
in the brain, a seizure,

01:31:36.960 --> 01:31:39.980
tells you a whole lot about
matching with the behavior.

01:31:39.980 --> 01:31:42.620
People, just before the
onset of the seizure,

01:31:42.620 --> 01:31:45.320
will get olfactory
auras-- two or three

01:31:45.320 --> 01:31:48.400
seconds of
hallucinating an odor.

01:31:48.400 --> 01:31:51.260
That's a seizure that's
starting somewhere down

01:31:51.260 --> 01:31:54.040
in the olfactory part
of the limbic system.

01:31:54.040 --> 01:31:55.860
You see all sorts of cases.

01:31:55.860 --> 01:31:58.650
There have been documented
cases of epileptics

01:31:58.650 --> 01:32:02.110
who see a mathematical
equation for two seconds

01:32:02.110 --> 01:32:03.780
before the seizure hits.

01:32:03.780 --> 01:32:06.560
And that's an area of the
cortex where it turns up.

01:32:06.560 --> 01:32:10.210
Auditory seizures, where they
hear two measures of music--

01:32:10.210 --> 01:32:12.390
the same two measures
before it hits.

01:32:12.390 --> 01:32:15.870
What you see when you've got
these rare epilepsies, where

01:32:15.870 --> 01:32:18.320
the seizure begins
in the amygdala, is,

01:32:18.320 --> 01:32:22.316
two seconds before, the
person becomes furious.

01:32:22.316 --> 01:32:29.020
They-- I can't bel-- I am so
ang-- and then it happens.

01:32:29.020 --> 01:32:32.520
So, uncontrolled stimulation
in the amygdala, and you

01:32:32.520 --> 01:32:34.240
get some aggression there.

01:32:34.240 --> 01:32:36.610
The next thing that
you see is evidence

01:32:36.610 --> 01:32:38.661
of the amygdaloid stimulation.

01:32:38.661 --> 01:32:39.160
OK.

01:32:39.160 --> 01:32:41.882
Anybody ever hear of a
guy named Charles Whitman?

01:32:44.770 --> 01:32:48.510
Hands-- oh, what are they
teaching you guys, here?

01:32:48.510 --> 01:32:49.010
OK.

01:32:49.010 --> 01:32:53.290
Charles Whitman was once
America's record-holding mass

01:32:53.290 --> 01:32:54.310
murderer.

01:32:54.310 --> 01:32:57.840
And he was the best
that we could come up

01:32:57.840 --> 01:32:59.510
with in the early 1960s.

01:32:59.510 --> 01:33:01.480
And, oh, his records
have been eclipsed

01:33:01.480 --> 01:33:03.290
by so many people since then.

01:33:03.290 --> 01:33:06.830
But he was once our
gold-medal mass murderer.

01:33:06.830 --> 01:33:10.280
This was the guy who,
in 1962, I think,

01:33:10.280 --> 01:33:14.440
climbed up the famed clock tower
at the University of Texas,

01:33:14.440 --> 01:33:18.400
Austin, campus and opened
fire on people below.

01:33:18.400 --> 01:33:20.980
And then killed
himself, afterward.

01:33:20.980 --> 01:33:24.000
This was the first of the
rounding up the neighbors

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:27.050
to say, oh my god, he
was such a quiet guy-- he

01:33:27.050 --> 01:33:28.460
was such a nice neighbor.

01:33:28.460 --> 01:33:33.030
This was the first of the
literal choirboys-- my god,

01:33:33.030 --> 01:33:35.520
where did this come from--
no hint of anything.

01:33:35.520 --> 01:33:41.250
On postmortem, he was found to
have a tumor in his amygdala.

01:33:41.250 --> 01:33:42.910
Another rare case of that.

01:33:42.910 --> 01:33:47.200
During the 1970s, there was an
extreme leftist terrorist group

01:33:47.200 --> 01:33:50.340
in Germany called the
Baader-Meinhof gang.

01:33:50.340 --> 01:33:52.610
And these were the two
people who began it.

01:33:52.610 --> 01:33:58.220
And one of the two stupendously
violent people-- one of the two

01:33:58.220 --> 01:34:02.890
found, on postmortem, to
have a tumor in her amygdala.

01:34:02.890 --> 01:34:06.140
So these very, very
rare cases of this,

01:34:06.140 --> 01:34:08.460
fitting with this
theme-- circumstances

01:34:08.460 --> 01:34:11.690
that increase the
metabolism in the amygdala.

01:34:11.690 --> 01:34:14.220
Out comes aggressive behavior.

01:34:14.220 --> 01:34:15.380
More evidence.

01:34:15.380 --> 01:34:18.190
Now, another strategy
from the limbic lectures.

01:34:18.190 --> 01:34:19.420
Put in the electrode.

01:34:19.420 --> 01:34:22.530
This is one that responds
to electrical signaling.

01:34:22.530 --> 01:34:24.500
Show somebody
something that evokes

01:34:24.500 --> 01:34:27.920
aggression, and their
amygdala has gotten activated.

01:34:27.920 --> 01:34:29.650
Do the same thing,
now, with a human.

01:34:29.650 --> 01:34:32.330
Put them in a brain
scanner, and show them

01:34:32.330 --> 01:34:34.170
something that evokes anger.

01:34:34.170 --> 01:34:38.580
And the metabolic rate in
their amygdala activates.

01:34:38.580 --> 01:34:41.480
So you see all sorts
of circumstances

01:34:41.480 --> 01:34:47.080
where you can document the
amygdala as playing this role.

01:34:47.080 --> 01:34:49.480
Interestingly, the amygdala
gets bigger, as we've heard,

01:34:49.480 --> 01:34:52.610
in people with posttraumatic
stress disorder.

01:34:52.610 --> 01:34:56.090
And what you see there
is also increased

01:34:56.090 --> 01:34:59.600
frequency of violent behavior.

01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:02.500
More evidence that the amygdala
plays a role-- and this

01:35:02.500 --> 01:35:04.550
was a very subtle finding.

01:35:04.550 --> 01:35:08.890
This was from-- oh my god,
the clock in the back!

01:35:08.890 --> 01:35:11.210
Turn around and
look at that clock.

01:35:11.210 --> 01:35:15.010
[LAUGHTER]

01:35:17.860 --> 01:35:19.130
Everybody run!

01:35:19.130 --> 01:35:20.390
[LAUGHTER]

01:35:20.390 --> 01:35:22.040
OK, well, now that
it's almost done,

01:35:22.040 --> 01:35:24.010
I'll mention the very
last thing, here.

01:35:24.010 --> 01:35:26.940
These were studies
done showing-- OK,

01:35:26.940 --> 01:35:29.240
people with amygdaloid
lesions, they

01:35:29.240 --> 01:35:34.780
are very bad at detecting faces
expressing angry emotions.

01:35:34.780 --> 01:35:39.270
They are more trusting of people
than average individuals are.

01:35:39.270 --> 01:35:41.710
They are more likely to forgive.

01:35:41.710 --> 01:35:45.060
They are less capable of picking
up on any of that information.

01:35:45.060 --> 01:35:48.640
And a wonderful study done by
this guy, Antonio Damasio--

01:35:48.640 --> 01:35:50.600
again, one of the lead
figures in the field.

01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:55.190
What he did was eye tracking on
people with amygdaloid lesions.

01:35:55.190 --> 01:35:58.380
You get someone with this
part of the brain destroyed,

01:35:58.380 --> 01:36:01.060
and they don't look at
the eyes of other people.

01:36:01.060 --> 01:36:04.320
When they examine faces,
they're looking at the nose.

01:36:04.320 --> 01:36:05.910
They're looking at the chin.

01:36:05.910 --> 01:36:10.130
They're not directing their gaze
to be able to pick up accurate

01:36:10.130 --> 01:36:12.680
information about emotions.

01:36:12.680 --> 01:36:14.100
So what do we see, here?

01:36:14.100 --> 01:36:17.780
The amygdala not only
responds to aggression

01:36:17.780 --> 01:36:19.700
and fear-provoking stimuli.

01:36:19.700 --> 01:36:23.320
The amygdala is able to
direct you to look for it.

01:36:23.320 --> 01:36:26.000
And what we will
see on Wednesday is,

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:29.040
one of the things
testosterone does in males

01:36:29.040 --> 01:36:30.730
is it makes them look harder.

01:36:30.730 --> 01:36:33.260
It lowers their
threshold for deciding

01:36:33.260 --> 01:36:37.240
that ambiguous
information is, in fact--

01:36:37.240 --> 01:36:40.510

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:05.836
Stanford University.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.000
Picking up from Monday,
OK, so we are now well

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.720
into our second topic
of the second half,

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.710
looking at aggression,
competition, cooperation,

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.290
empathy, all those guys.

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.850
And we've got the drill down
by now, starting with behavior

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.060
all the way to the right,
working our way to the left

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.860
all the way back to evolution,
genetics, blah, blah.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.420
Where we left off the
other day was just

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.540
getting into the first
box worth of what's

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:48.510
going on in the brain?

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.840
What is the neurobiology
of what's occurring seconds

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.550
before that aggressive act, that
compassionate act, all of that?

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.720
As we know already, right in
the middle of the limbic system,

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.070
of course, as we know
already, the amygdala

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.760
is playing a really
central role,

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.010
and seeing all the
evidence for it--

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.880
lesion studies, stimulation
studies, the bizarre rarer

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.090
realm of humans who have
had lesions, or stimulation

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.400
there, accidents, or intentional
psycho surgical interventions,

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.470
beginning to look at
the amygdala there,

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.310
and the role that it plays.

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.270
Now, part of what
becomes relevant

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.390
there is seeing the
kind of information

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:27.960
that the amygdala is getting.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.440
And an important
thing to focus on

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:30.940
is something that
was mentioned back

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.110
in the limbic
lecture, the notion we

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:34.900
ended with the other
day, the amygdala.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.940
OK, so you look at somebody
who has had amygdala damage.

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.770
And they tend to not be able
to detect fear-evoking faces.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.800
They are overly trustful.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.020
They are underlie skeptical.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.420
They are not taking in
the sort of information

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.650
we would that leads
us to conclude

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.720
this is a circumstance
that demands arousal,

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.050
vigilance, so on.

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.480
One of the things that was
seen, interesting study

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.300
that I noted at the
end the other day,

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.930
was looking at people with
amygdala lesions, Damasio

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.500
and his group looking at
this, keeping track of where

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.509
the eyes are looking.

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.920
When they see another face, they
are not looking with the eyes

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.590
any or near as much as
everybody else would.

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.670
They are instead tracking around
all sorts of extraneous parts

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:19.530
of the face.

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.120
Normally, people look
at the eyes a whole lot.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.460
And what that winds
up showing is not only

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.740
is the amygdala playing
a role in deciding

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.980
this is a fear or
aggression-evoking stimulus,

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.140
the amygdala is also
on the lookout for it.

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.030
And what we will see in a little
while is one of the things

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.060
testosterone does is
make the amygdala better

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.380
at looking for fear and
anger-evoking faces.

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.380
So part of what the
amygdala is doing

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.970
is taking in
sensory information.

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.511
We touched in the limbic lecture
on one interesting aspect

00:02:53.511 --> 00:02:54.010
of it.

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.430
OK, back to that business,
that the limbic strategy

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.580
of counting the number of
synapses, that strange business

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.670
about olfaction being
only one synapse away

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.470
from lots of parts
of the limbic system,

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.530
including the amygdala
if you were dealing

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.570
with a [INAUDIBLE],
the olfactory world

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.410
as being so emotional
for a rodent.

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.400
For us, we've got something
else interesting happening.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.170
And I think I mentioned this.

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.070
OK, so you've got
the visual system.

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:22.860
And what we have
is the usual rule

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.110
that visual information--
just like auditory,

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.870
just like tactile--
comes in, and goes

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.760
by way of a way station along
the way, whose name we won't

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.540
worry about, and goes
through all these levels

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.520
of cortical processing,
and [? bio cort ?] people

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.460
will remember layer one,
doing dots, to lines,

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.590
to moving lines, all of
that, eventually processing

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.200
assessment, come up with
an idea that, oh, dear,

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.760
this is a menacing face.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.110
And then let the
amygdala know about this.

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.400
What was also found
a number of years ago

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.330
is that there is a shortcut.

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.890
There is a branch coming off
of this way station called

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:58.320
the lateral geniculate.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.370
There's a branch coming
off, which then is only one

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.445
synapse away from the amygdala.

00:04:03.445 --> 00:04:06.970
What we heard is
that's really useful,

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.640
in that it can get you
fear-evoking, arousing

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.640
information that much faster
than going through all

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.040
this cortical processing.

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.399
It is a short cut.

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:18.500
It is not a one synapse away.

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.940
But it certainly makes
for fewer synapses.

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.030
That's a faster
system that we've

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.650
got in order to
very quickly pick up

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.120
information that
should be of interest

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.350
to the amygdala and all
of its fear, anxiety,

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:32.977
aggression-type concerns.

00:04:32.977 --> 00:04:33.810
So that's wonderful.

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.380
That's terrific
for the amygdala.

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:36.860
What I think we
also heard it is it

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.210
comes with a downside, which is
you send all this information

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:42.630
through all these
different steps

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.450
there because it's doing
all this cortical processing

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:46.160
for you.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.170
It's figuring out
all the details

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:50.620
of the sensory information
you're getting in.

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.520
This way, it gets to
the amygdala faster.

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.490
But what gets there
is less accurate.

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.940
You're more likely
to make a mistake.

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.510
And that's the whole world of
people reacting really quickly

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.740
to some peripheral
piece of information,

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.760
which turns out to be different
than they thought it was.

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.050
And before they knew
it, they had reacted.

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.080
This is the cortex sitting
there, still trying to decide,

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.770
is this a
three-dimensional object

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.110
or a two-dimensional one?

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.920
And through this route, you've
already stabbed the individual.

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:23.990
This is a very, very clear
trade-off-- faster information,

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:25.070
less accurate.

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:27.200
And there is, by now,
a lot of evidence

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.920
to suggest that this
particular pathway is

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:33.710
hyper excitable in individuals
with post-traumatic stress

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:37.450
disorder, where that
whole world of all sorts

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:42.070
of acute sensory stimuli
suddenly fling the person back

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:45.200
into where they were when
that happened to them,

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.540
and without the processing
time to figure out,

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:49.510
this isn't exactly the same.

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:52.530
In fact, this is a world away
from where that happened.

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:55.200
Already, the amygdala
is responding.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:57.089
So these short cuts--
but telling you,

00:05:57.089 --> 00:05:59.130
one of the things you give
up with the short cuts

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:02.310
is the analytical accuracy.

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:05.630
OK, so amygdala for that,
amygdala equals fear,

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:07.860
equals anxiety,
equals aggression.

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.170
Isn't that interesting?

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:11.660
In a world in which
amygdala is not afraid,

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:14.090
there's no aggression,
that whole theme there.

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:16.710
The amygdala isn't
always about fear,

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:18.480
and aggression, and anxiety.

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.610
And it's very
informative, the examples

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:22.420
where that's not the case.

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:25.580
One case, really
interesting syndrome

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:27.357
called Williams
syndrome, which we're

00:06:27.357 --> 00:06:29.440
going to hear a lot about
in the language lecture.

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:34.300
Williams syndrome appears to be
a poorly understood imprinted

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:37.620
genetic disorder where you
get, among other things,

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:41.950
kids who are unbelievably
facile with language

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:44.030
and emotional expressivity.

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:46.030
This whole world
of Williams kids,

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:48.060
it's this fascinating
disorder where

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:52.110
you get kids who are basically
borderline retarded in terms

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:53.370
of cognitive function.

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:57.140
Yet, they have this spectacular
adeptness at language,

00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:00.640
at reading emotions in other
people, at communicating them.

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:03.420
They are famously
affectionate kids

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:06.220
amid being very
cognitively impaired.

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:07.680
We'll see in the
language lecture,

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:10.030
most people think
about Williams syndrome

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:13.820
as an interesting example of
the modularity of language

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:15.320
control in the cortex.

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:20.050
You can have very, very
facile language skills

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:22.760
in these individuals who,
nonetheless, are typically

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:25.990
in the IQ range of about
70, argument being,

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:28.720
we'll see in a couple of weeks,
that there are specialized

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.700
cortical areas for language.

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:32.500
For our purposes,
the interesting thing

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:35.210
about Williams kids, and
eventually Williams adults,

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:38.540
is they are extremely trustful.

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:40.850
They are extremely gregarious.

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:44.220
They are incredibly
vulnerable as adults

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:47.200
to being taken advantage
of by other people.

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:50.450
And what you see with Williams
individuals is you basically

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:55.370
cannot evoke amygdala
activation with scary faces.

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:58.100
They don't register in
someone with Williams.

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:01.090
So there, we see that
this is not universally

00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:02.760
serving that role.

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:04.330
Another example
where there seems

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:06.210
to be an exception
until you think about it

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:09.190
a little bit, people
with social phobias.

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:12.700
What studies have shown
is, show a social phobic

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:17.280
any sort of face-- human face--
and their amygdala activates.

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:19.990
Oh, that's not telling
us anything informative.

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:22.330
It's telling us something
very informative,

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:25.200
which is if you have a
severe social phobia,

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:27.820
any face is a scary face to you.

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:30.960
All faces do that, rather
than only ones communicating

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:33.490
certain threatening emotions.

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:35.530
Another one that seems
puzzling, but which

00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:38.080
then makes perfect sense
when you think about it, when

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:41.159
you take people with clinical
depression the amygdala

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:43.450
doesn't necessarily
activate when

00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:46.540
you show them a picture
of something frightening.

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:50.700
It activates when you show them
a picture of something sad.

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:54.990
OK, so now instead of
doing fear and depression,

00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:57.440
the amygdala does
sadness or something.

00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:58.920
If you think about
it for a minute,

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:00.600
that makes perfect sense.

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:03.430
What the amygdala might
very well be doing

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:07.020
is responding to whatever it
is that is most ethologically

00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:11.380
frightening to you-- you as a
species, you as an individual.

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:13.310
If you are somebody
who's depressed,

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:15.020
the most frightening
thing on Earth

00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:18.690
is something sad around you, as
more justification for feeling

00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:21.730
even more depressed, the
amygdala being far more

00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:25.320
subtle than, oh, here's a scary
predator with a knife coming

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:28.850
at me, very much contextual.

00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:32.780
OK, another thing that the
amygdala is brilliant at,

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:35.220
which we will come
back to in more detail,

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:37.710
but on a first pass
it is so depressing,

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:40.930
is the amygdala is probably
the part of your brain

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:44.827
that is best at doing
dichotomizing between us

00:09:44.827 --> 00:09:48.880
and them-- forming categories
in-group, out-group,

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:52.340
and responding to
out-group stimuli.

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:55.840
And we will see two things down
the line, probably on Friday.

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:59.670
Number one, it is
really, really depressing

00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:01.730
how readily the
amygdala forms some

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:04.735
of these us-them dichotomies,
and the sort of them

00:10:04.735 --> 00:10:07.790
that it responds to--
really depressing.

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:09.310
But also some good
news in there,

00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:12.990
remarkably subtle social
manipulations that

00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:15.610
will change the sort
of us-them dichotomies

00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:17.540
that the amygdala responds to.

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:19.440
So stay tuned for that.

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:21.490
OK, so shifting
from the amygdala,

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:24.910
going to the incredibly
interesting and important

00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:26.180
frontal cortex.

00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:28.710
And frontal cortex, obviously,
was doing all sorts of stuff

00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:31.120
two lectures ago
in the sex lecture,

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:33.530
getting you to have
the appropriate context

00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:36.570
for sexual behavior, getting
to do the harder thing,

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:39.200
like leaping over
streams, and head butting

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:41.300
with other antlered
beasts if that's

00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:42.590
part of your mating season.

00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:45.800
Where the frontal cortex
is particularly involved

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:49.770
is this whole world of
regulating appropriate behavior

00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:53.940
in the context of violence,
aggression, competition,

00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:54.950
cooperation.

00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:58.610
Frontal cortex is
incredibly important here.

00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:01.830
OK, back to the limbic
lecture-- the limbic system

00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:06.450
is about sub-cortical structures
underneath, things like that.

00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:08.570
And the cortex is
about the cortex.

00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:10.150
And we heard in
the limbic lecture,

00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:12.740
instead what was originally
that heretical view

00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:15.120
by that neuroanatomist
Nauta saying,

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:18.250
actually, the frontal cortex
is part of the limbic system.

00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:19.520
It should be viewed as such.

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:21.650
And over the years since,
it being viewed as,

00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:24.760
this is the cortical part
of the limbic system.

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:28.710
This is the cortical region
that is intensely involved

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:31.290
with limbic function,
with emotional function.

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:33.980
On an anatomical level,
what we've already seen

00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:38.510
is just as a first pass, tons
of bidirectional connections,

00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:40.500
everything in the
limbic system talking

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:42.800
to the frontal
cortex, frontal cortex

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:45.550
sending projections back
over the limbic system.

00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:47.930
So anatomically, it's there.

00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:51.430
So in terms of what it's doing--
the best way to describe what

00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:53.910
the frontal cortex is
about is when there's

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:57.590
a choice between doing something
harder and something easier,

00:11:57.590 --> 00:11:59.830
and the harder thing is
the better thing to do,

00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:02.640
it's the thing that makes
you do the harder thing.

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:04.950
And we'll see this
plays out in all sorts

00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:07.520
of domains, the
frontal cortex getting

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:09.740
you to do the harder thing.

00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:14.330
First beginning to see the way
it works in terms of wiring--

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:16.970
OK, here we have
reduced the entire world

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:19.690
down to a simplified,
there's two neurons

00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:22.149
that account for all the easier
things you do in your life.

00:12:22.149 --> 00:12:23.731
And there's three
neurons that account

00:12:23.731 --> 00:12:24.840
for all the harder ones.

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:27.400
Here, we have some
circumstance where

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:31.130
there's a circuit at some
juncture, the easier but less

00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:32.720
desirable outcome.

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:35.840
Behavior is this way,
the harder one that way.

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:40.950
And what you see is this has
more inputs then this one.

00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:44.280
This is obviously some
entire circuit of neurons.

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:46.680
And this is highly
simplified, blah, blah.

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:48.630
But what we see is the
way it's set up here

00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:52.410
is that there are more
inputs into this pathway.

00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:54.990
This is what makes
this neuron easier

00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:57.050
to activate than this one.

00:12:57.050 --> 00:13:00.000
There are stronger
inputs into this pathway.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.800
This one has only two
axons going to it.

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:05.060
This one has three--
yes, simplified.

00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:08.430
When you look at the wiring
of the frontal cortex,

00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:11.540
it's sending projections
all over the limbic system,

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:13.380
all over motor areas.

00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:15.460
A characteristic
of the projections

00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:19.880
is that very rarely are
they very strong projections

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:22.100
to any given target area.

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:25.700
They're not the sort of
projections where, here's

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:27.990
this frontal cortical
neuron that is now

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:31.300
dumping all of its axon
terminals into this one neuron

00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:32.110
down there.

00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:35.210
It does not exert a
very strong influence

00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:38.430
over the excitation
of any given neuron.

00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:42.830
Instead, what it has is a
whole lot of weak but diffuse

00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:43.880
projections.

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:46.370
What is the frontal
cortex doing?

00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:49.540
It's slowly massaging
the area there.

00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:54.540
It is giving biasing bits of
de-polarization of excitation.

00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:58.004
So what we've got here
is-- OK, the numbers

00:13:58.004 --> 00:13:58.920
are not quite working.

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:00.940
But in any case,
what we have here is,

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:03.740
here's doing the right
thing that's harder.

00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:05.850
And it's a lot harder
to get this neuron

00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:07.900
to do the right
thing that's harder,

00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:10.360
because there is less of
an input than this pathway.

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:12.400
What the frontal
cortex tends to do

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:16.610
is have these relatively weak
inputs into all these systems

00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:20.160
where it makes it a little
bit harder to just fall

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:21.130
for this one.

00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:23.840
It gives more strength
into this pathway.

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:25.970
The frontal
projections very rarely

00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:27.940
are activating on their own.

00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:32.260
Yes, indeed, we have another
example here of modulating.

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:35.080
If and only if this
pathway is already

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:37.020
struggling to do
the right thing,

00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:40.030
the frontal cortex tends
to be able to push it

00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:42.060
over the top there
to pull it off.

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:46.450
Frontal projections as very
diffuse, relatively weak,

00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:51.250
but biasing towards excitation,
rather than causing it,

00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:54.660
that tends to be the
thing that it does.

00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:58.140
What you see in terms of making
sense of frontal function

00:14:58.140 --> 00:14:59.930
is, as we heard
the other day also,

00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:04.270
a huge whopping projection
from that nucleus accumbens.

00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:06.830
You remember ventral
tegmental, nucleus accumbens,

00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:12.250
this huge dopamine releasing
projection into there.

00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:15.390
And on a certain level--
you want a totally useless

00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:19.070
metaphor, but on a certain level
with the dopamine projection

00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:22.140
is about is-- so here, you've
got the frontal cortex.

00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:23.740
The frontal cortex,
for a living,

00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:25.510
makes you do the
harder thing when

00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:27.020
it's the right thing to do.

00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:30.920
Dopamine is, in a sense,
the fuel for that activity.

00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:35.320
Dopamine, the expectation,
the anticipation, the capacity

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:38.970
of dopamine to generate
goal-directed behaviors

00:15:38.970 --> 00:15:41.460
is heavily running
through this pathway.

00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:43.530
Dopamine is a thing
that's giving,

00:15:43.530 --> 00:15:45.940
in a sense, the frontal
cortex the energy

00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:48.870
to just push you over the
edge, and to tell you,

00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:52.790
yes, go this way instead of
this way, which also intrinsic

00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:58.270
in this lots and lots of frontal
projections that are inhibitory

00:15:58.270 --> 00:15:59.180
in that realm.

00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:02.180
An awful lot of what
frontal cortex is also doing

00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:04.380
is whispering to
this pathway saying,

00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:05.800
you really shouldn't do that.

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:07.120
You're going to regret it.

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:08.600
I know it's tempting right now.

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:12.470
Don't do it, don't do it-- this
super ego sort of neuroanatomy

00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:16.780
there of frontal cortex,
dopamine as very strongly

00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:20.250
stimulatory in there, the
whole role of dopamine

00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:23.140
as driving
goal-directed behavior.

00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:25.540
And that was that critical
business we saw in that study

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:28.680
showing you let the monkey
know that it's now entered one

00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:30.930
of those periods where
if it lever presses,

00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:32.072
it gets the reward.

00:16:32.072 --> 00:16:35.350
Oh, I know just how this works--
anticipation, that's great.

00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:36.600
Up goes dopamine.

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:39.080
If you prevent the
dopamine from going up,

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:41.070
you don't get the
lever pressing.

00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:44.090
Dopamine is not just
about anticipation.

00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:48.370
Dopamine is about driving
the behavior needed

00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:50.650
to get the reward that
you are anticipating,

00:16:50.650 --> 00:16:54.250
dopamine as
goal-directed behavior.

00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:57.200
OK, so what you
begin to see in terms

00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:00.350
of how this frontal
cortex does this making

00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:03.570
you do the harder thing,
it's manifest in all sorts

00:17:03.570 --> 00:17:04.609
of domains.

00:17:04.609 --> 00:17:06.470
Easiest, most
accessible realm is

00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:08.770
seeing what it has
to do with cognition,

00:17:08.770 --> 00:17:10.819
the way in which the
frontal cortex gets

00:17:10.819 --> 00:17:12.339
you to do the harder thing.

00:17:12.339 --> 00:17:16.480
What it helps you to do is
organize bits of information

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:19.690
in ways that makes it
easier to make sense of.

00:17:19.690 --> 00:17:22.700
Here is, if you ever find
yourself being borderline

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:24.680
demented, and somebody
is giving you a test,

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:26.805
this is one of the tests
they're going to give you.

00:17:26.805 --> 00:17:27.760
So start preparing.

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:30.190
This is this
horrifying test called

00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:34.650
the CVLT-- the California
Verbal Learning Task

00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:36.110
or some such thing like that.

00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:37.110
But here's what they do.

00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:39.000
Some neuropsychologist
sits you down.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.294
And says, oh, I'm just
going to tell you something,

00:17:41.294 --> 00:17:42.210
a list of things here.

00:17:42.210 --> 00:17:43.440
See if you can remember.

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:45.140
Today I went to the market.

00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:50.220
And I bought one tomato, one
hammer, one box of cereal,

00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:53.310
one grape, one-- and
goes through a list of 16

00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:55.330
of these, one
every second or so.

00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:56.000
And they finish.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:56.615
And they say.

00:17:56.615 --> 00:17:58.990
OK, do you happen to remember
what I bought at the market

00:17:58.990 --> 00:17:59.640
today?

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:01.860
Oh my God, it is so stressful.

00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:04.760
So you manage to get out like
maybe seven of them correct.

00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:07.127
And the person says,
OK, that's very good.

00:18:07.127 --> 00:18:07.960
Let's do that again.

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:09.170
Today, I went to the market.

00:18:09.170 --> 00:18:13.080
And I brought one tomato, one
hammer, one box of Cheerios,

00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:15.320
one box of-- and goes
through this list again,

00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:17.870
and seeing each time how
many of them you remember,

00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:20.500
beginning to see your
memory acquisition

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:22.885
thing as you're getting closer
and closer to remembering

00:18:22.885 --> 00:18:24.370
all 16.

00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:27.410
It's not until you're maybe
in the third or fourth round

00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:29.470
of doing this that
you begin to notice

00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:34.650
something, which is of the 16
items four of them are fruits.

00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:37.130
Four of them are hardware items.

00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:39.840
Four of them are
bread cereal things.

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:41.206
Four of them are who knows what.

00:18:41.206 --> 00:18:42.580
And they're
scattered throughout.

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:44.500
What the people
typically start doing

00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:47.540
by the third or fourth
one is you begin to group

00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:48.970
them by categories.

00:18:48.970 --> 00:18:54.520
And instead of remembering back
OK, tomato, hammer, cereal,

00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:58.100
fruit, whatever, you first
tell the three out of the four

00:18:58.100 --> 00:18:59.600
fruits that you remember.

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:01.980
Then you tell the two out
of the four hardware items.

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:05.030
You are beginning to
group the information.

00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:08.170
And what that is called
is executive function.

00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:11.000
Executive organizing
strategy, it

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:16.240
is sheer memory systems that are
remembering these 16 factoids.

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:19.080
It is executive organizing
that's telling you,

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:20.790
do you notice some
patterns there?

00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:22.640
Don't just remember
it in sequence.

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:24.900
Don't try to just
remember it in sequence.

00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:26.070
Stop for a second.

00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:27.972
And try to keep track
of the categories,

00:19:27.972 --> 00:19:29.430
because that's
going to be a better

00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:31.060
strategy in the long run.

00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:33.200
That's what the
frontal cortex does.

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:35.720
You get someone with
frontal cortical damage,

00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:38.710
and their capacity to
remember, the learning curve

00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:41.030
is not all that different
from anyone else.

00:19:41.030 --> 00:19:43.380
But they never start
doing the grouping.

00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:46.750
They never start doing what
we might think of as almost

00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:49.290
cognitive strategizing.

00:19:49.290 --> 00:19:50.990
Oh, I see a pattern here.

00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:54.030
And I suspect if I put
the effort into exploiting

00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:56.990
that pattern, it's going to
make it more productive for me

00:19:56.990 --> 00:19:59.460
to try to remember things
rather than just trying

00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:00.680
to do it in sequence.

00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:03.290
So the frontal cortex
is good for that.

00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:05.610
Where else do you get
in the cognitive realm

00:20:05.610 --> 00:20:09.080
the frontal cortex getting
you to do the harder thing?

00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:10.930
Where you get all
this information

00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:13.290
in the cognitive realm
is when you study people

00:20:13.290 --> 00:20:16.510
with frontal damage-- either
people with accidents,

00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:20.310
or very often older individuals
who have strokes there.

00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:22.430
There's a very distinctive
type of dementia

00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:25.140
that takes out the
frontal cortex called

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:26.310
frontotemporal dementia.

00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:28.610
And all sorts of cognitive
tests in those cases

00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:31.140
showing in the
cognitive realm what

00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:34.310
happens when you're not
having this going on

00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:36.120
throughout all the circuitry.

00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:37.580
One thing that
would be given-- OK,

00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:39.390
so you sit down this individual.

00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:43.540
And you say, OK, you
recognize this, don't you?

00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:45.730
Even though most of you
guys don't by now growing up

00:20:45.730 --> 00:20:47.040
in the digital era.

00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:48.792
But this is the face of a clock.

00:20:48.792 --> 00:20:50.750
And it comes with a little
hand and a big hand.

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:52.730
And they point in
informative directions.

00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:55.760
So you ask the person,
OK, you recognize this.

00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:57.260
Of course, this is a clock face.

00:20:57.260 --> 00:20:59.280
Now, where would
you draw the hands

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:03.490
if I said the time was 11:10?

00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:05.770
11:10, so sit for a minute,
and think about where.

00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:08.212
And, of course, it's
10 minutes after 11:00.

00:21:08.212 --> 00:21:09.920
And that's that where
the hands would go.

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:14.170
Someone with frontal damage,
instead, would draw the hands

00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:16.170
at 11 and 10.

00:21:16.170 --> 00:21:17.520
What are the rest of us doing?

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:18.960
We're saying, OK,
the easier thing

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:22.210
is to just get gummed
up on the number 11

00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:24.670
and the number 10-- wait,
wait, don't do that.

00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:28.020
Hold on, remember,
10 is a coding

00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:30.240
for multiples of five
minutes, because that's

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:31.770
the way clocks are organized.

00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:33.600
So 10 is actually two of these.

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:35.100
So it's 11:10.

00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:37.780
10 is a shorthand for
saying 10 minutes after.

00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:39.530
And you put your hands
in the right place.

00:21:39.530 --> 00:21:42.240
Somebody with frontal
damage can't hold off.

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:45.340
And they get pulled by
the easiest interpretation

00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:47.150
of the sound 11:10.

00:21:47.150 --> 00:21:49.790
They draw the
hands at 11 and 10.

00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:51.770
So this is what you would see.

00:21:51.770 --> 00:21:55.000
More examples-- what the
frontal cortex is good at

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.910
is getting you to
inhibit the easier

00:21:57.910 --> 00:22:00.400
route when it is a
very well-learned, very

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:01.750
well-conditioned one.

00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:02.810
Here's what you would do.

00:22:02.810 --> 00:22:04.351
Now you take the
person who you think

00:22:04.351 --> 00:22:05.630
may have some frontal damage.

00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:08.250
And you say, OK, here's
a task I want you to do.

00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:11.140
Starting with December,
tell me the months

00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:13.110
of the year backwards.

00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:16.010
What have we all learned
since way back in first grade

00:22:16.010 --> 00:22:16.900
or whatever?

00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:19.720
That this is an easy
thing going forward.

00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:21.650
This is the harder
thing right now.

00:22:21.650 --> 00:22:23.590
And you will see a person
with frontal damage

00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:31.990
will say OK, December, November,
October, September, October,

00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:33.100
November, December.

00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:35.260
They manage to pull
it off for a while.

00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:38.890
And then they just slip on the
ice back into the easier way.

00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:41.530
It is, you normally
have December followed

00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:43.930
by January, not by November.

00:22:43.930 --> 00:22:46.060
It takes more work
to do it that way.

00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:49.340
People with frontal damage,
they have this intrusion.

00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:53.150
They can't hold off the
over-learned response,

00:22:53.150 --> 00:22:55.720
the more habitual response.

00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:57.950
You would then see with
frontal damage something

00:22:57.950 --> 00:22:59.539
that's termed intrusions.

00:22:59.539 --> 00:23:01.830
Now you would say to the same
person, OK, that's great.

00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:02.371
That's great.

00:23:02.371 --> 00:23:05.090
Now what I want you to do
is start with the number 20

00:23:05.090 --> 00:23:06.560
and count backwards.

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:14.810
And the person will say, OK, 20,
19, 18, 17, September, October,

00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:15.990
November, December.

00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:18.830
And they've slipped back
into the previous task.

00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:21.102
They don't have the
effort here to say,

00:23:21.102 --> 00:23:22.810
we've stopped it with
the months already.

00:23:22.810 --> 00:23:23.950
Now we're doing numbers.

00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:26.420
Don't slip back into
that month stuff.

00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:28.860
But, yet, that's
exactly what occurs.

00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:30.800
You take somebody
with frontal damage.

00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:33.550
You give them would be
called a verbal fluency test.

00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:36.460
You say, OK, one minute,
tell me as many words

00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:39.637
as you could think of starting
with the letter F. Great.

00:23:39.637 --> 00:23:41.220
Now tell me as many
words as you could

00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:43.370
think of starting with the
letter M, with the letter P,

00:23:43.370 --> 00:23:43.960
so on.

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:47.350
And you go with the letter
M. And by the fifth word,

00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:50.810
they're back to words with
F. The previous task intrudes

00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:51.560
in there.

00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:54.452
It has trouble
organizing, strategizing,

00:23:54.452 --> 00:23:55.910
we're done with
the letter F. We're

00:23:55.910 --> 00:23:57.400
done with doing the months.

00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:59.320
Concentrate now,
we're doing the letter

00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:01.390
M. We're doing
numbers backwards.

00:24:01.390 --> 00:24:04.830
Don't fall for the easy
version of just saying 11:10.

00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:07.490
This is the stuff the
frontal cortex does.

00:24:07.490 --> 00:24:10.530
This is what it looks like
when you are getting damage

00:24:10.530 --> 00:24:12.710
to the frontal cortex.

00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:15.190
So cognitive aspects
of that-- what's

00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:19.040
the frontal cortex particularly
good at in the cognitive realm?

00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:23.920
It is making you work, and work,
and work for a cognitive reward

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:25.160
way down the line.

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:27.790
And that's the entire world
of all of you guys already

00:24:27.790 --> 00:24:30.400
gunning for the perfect
GPA that will get you

00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:32.350
into a good nursing
home someday.

00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:36.060
That is your frontal cortex
working to your advantage.

00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:38.930
That's your frontal cortex
doing that, this task

00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:41.400
of gratification postponement.

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:43.010
Do the harder thing.

00:24:43.010 --> 00:24:45.360
Where am I going to
get the energy for it?

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:47.930
It's these frontal
inputs that's just

00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:52.250
biasing so I could do the harder
pathway rather than the easier.

00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:55.230
You find this also when you're
doing electrophysiological,

00:24:55.230 --> 00:24:57.510
when you're recording, you're
sticking in electrodes,

00:24:57.510 --> 00:24:59.560
and seeing when
neurons are excited.

00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:01.710
Suppose, for example,
you've got a monkey.

00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:03.100
And you are recording.

00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:05.500
You have electrodes both
in the visual cortex

00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:07.960
and some other ones
in the frontal cortex.

00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:10.490
And, again, this is one
of those tasks where

00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:14.010
when the bell sounds--
bells don't beep,

00:25:14.010 --> 00:25:16.380
when some buzzer beeps, it
means to the monkey, now,

00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:18.327
OK, every time
the light goes on,

00:25:18.327 --> 00:25:19.910
you have to press a
lever three times.

00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:21.260
And you get a reward.

00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:22.010
That's the rule.

00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:24.810
Buzzer means we're starting
one of those testing sessions

00:25:24.810 --> 00:25:25.430
again.

00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:28.240
Light comes on, hit lever,
light comes on, hit lever.

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:31.364
So you record from
the visual cortex.

00:25:31.364 --> 00:25:32.530
And here's what's happening.

00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:34.430
This is when the
buzzer comes on saying,

00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:37.510
oh, we've just started
one of these test periods.

00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:39.220
And now the light flashes.

00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:42.320
And the visual cortex
activates each time.

00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:44.860
What's going on in
the frontal cortex?

00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:48.840
The second the buzzer goes off,
the frontal cortex activates.

00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:52.410
And it stays up the whole time.

00:25:52.410 --> 00:25:55.090
What is the visual
cortex coding for?

00:25:55.090 --> 00:25:58.060
Individual examples
of this task.

00:25:58.060 --> 00:26:00.210
What's the frontal
cortex coding for?

00:26:00.210 --> 00:26:02.453
It's remembering the rule.

00:26:02.453 --> 00:26:04.770
OK, the buzzer went on.

00:26:04.770 --> 00:26:06.760
That means-- now,
remember, remember,

00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:09.780
remember for the next whatever
period of time, get ready.

00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:12.590
Every time the light
flashes, hit the lever there.

00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:15.140
The task of the
frontal cortex is

00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:18.380
to maintain the rule
throughout, transcending

00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:20.650
the individual examples of it.

00:26:20.650 --> 00:26:22.580
So you can already
see where we're

00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:25.350
heading with moral
development in kids,

00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:27.134
and frontal maturation.

00:26:27.134 --> 00:26:28.800
And all of that's
going to fit in really

00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:31.600
well, the frontal cortex
doing stuff like that.

00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:35.230
What you should begin to notice
is intrinsic in all of this,

00:26:35.230 --> 00:26:37.740
the frontal cortex is
sending these projections

00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:39.110
all over the brain.

00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:42.530
The frontal cortex does not
code for individual examples

00:26:42.530 --> 00:26:46.410
of rules, but instead maintains
rules for long, long periods.

00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:49.860
The frontal cortex
works really hard.

00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:53.190
Frontal cortical neurons have
very high metabolic rates.

00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:56.990
And a whole world of neurology,
thus, is built around the fact

00:26:56.990 --> 00:26:59.830
that frontal cortical
neurons are very fragile.

00:26:59.830 --> 00:27:01.540
They die very readily.

00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:04.040
All sorts of
neurological disorders

00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:07.400
damage the frontal cortex
with behavioral changes

00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:09.730
that go along with that.

00:27:09.730 --> 00:27:12.730
So you've got the wiring,
the patterning, all of that.

00:27:12.730 --> 00:27:15.980
But then at some point
you wonder, well, I

00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:17.310
learn all sorts of rules.

00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:19.430
Back when I was about
three years old,

00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:22.870
I learned this rule having
to do with no more diapers.

00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:24.750
And if you go to the
potty, you get M&amp;Ms.

00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:27.640
And, in fact, I sort of
have internalized this.

00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:30.840
And same does that mean the,
you need to go to the bathroom

00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:34.340
now is internalized that there's
a frontal cortical neuron that

00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:36.100
got excited when I
was three years old

00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:39.460
and got toilet trained, and has
been firing ever since then?

00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:44.120
No, what you see after a while
is the frontal cortical realm

00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:45.274
of remember.

00:27:45.274 --> 00:27:47.690
Remember, you go to the bathroom
when you need to do this.

00:27:47.690 --> 00:27:49.648
Remember, remember, you
say the months forward.

00:27:49.648 --> 00:27:51.280
Remember all these
sorts of things.

00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:54.200
At some point, it
becomes automatic.

00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:56.350
It becomes reflexive.

00:27:56.350 --> 00:27:58.750
And what is seen
is at that point,

00:27:58.750 --> 00:28:03.020
the frontal cortex stops
being the area that is active.

00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:05.030
At some point,
instead, it becomes

00:28:05.030 --> 00:28:08.630
implicit procedural pathways.

00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:11.290
It gets stored
elsewhere in the brain.

00:28:11.290 --> 00:28:14.990
What you see in individuals
with Alzheimer's disease

00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:17.860
where you get a lot of
damage to the hippocampus

00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:20.440
and the cortex-- particularly
the frontal cortex-- what

00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:24.220
you see is all sorts of things
that were learned way back

00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:27.470
when, and learned enough
to just be habitual,

00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:29.200
people can still do.

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:33.210
You will have somebody who
is demented enough that they

00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:36.660
cannot tell you what decade it
is, the name of their spouse,

00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:39.120
the name of their children,
how many children they have,

00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:39.750
whatever.

00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:43.110
But this is someone who
still knows how to knit.

00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:45.780
They learned when they were
seven years old how to knit.

00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:48.490
And now 80 years later,
they can still do that.

00:28:48.490 --> 00:28:51.810
This is not the frontal cortex
remembering the knitting rules

00:28:51.810 --> 00:28:54.260
for the last 70 years or so.

00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:58.190
This is, it became automatic
and got moved elsewhere.

00:28:58.190 --> 00:29:00.590
And a whole bizarre
world you see

00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:02.717
with frontal damage
in individuals

00:29:02.717 --> 00:29:04.800
with these dementias where
some of the things that

00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:09.290
become automatic are remarkable,
suggesting that you've

00:29:09.290 --> 00:29:12.160
got storage capacity in
other places in the brain

00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:14.050
when you don't
have to consciously

00:29:14.050 --> 00:29:17.390
think about it, when something
has become so automatic.

00:29:17.390 --> 00:29:21.110
You go to the bathroom when
you need to void your bladder.

00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:23.250
OK, we don't have to
think about that anymore.

00:29:23.250 --> 00:29:26.320
It has now gotten to
a pathway like this.

00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:29.490
Other brain regions
particularly, the cerebellum,

00:29:29.490 --> 00:29:31.580
seems to play a
larger role in that.

00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:32.570
Stay tuned.

00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:35.800
We are going to be getting
to a very interesting point

00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:37.940
about moral development in kids.

00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:40.950
When do certain moral
rules stop having

00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:43.280
to be coded in the
frontal cortex,

00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:46.340
and instead become as
habitual as toilet training?

00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:48.550
We'll see some really
interesting implications

00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:49.810
of that.

00:29:49.810 --> 00:29:53.500
OK, so what do you see when
you get frontal damage?

00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:56.830
You get all these
cognitive problems there,

00:29:56.830 --> 00:29:59.790
and these problems with doing
the harder but more correct

00:29:59.790 --> 00:30:01.040
thing cognitively.

00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:03.460
You see it as well
in terms of doing

00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:05.900
the harder but more
correct thing in terms

00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:08.180
of behavior, social behavior.

00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:10.790
First classic
example of this, they

00:30:10.790 --> 00:30:12.677
take away your
neurobiology license

00:30:12.677 --> 00:30:14.510
if you don't mention
this guy at some point.

00:30:14.510 --> 00:30:17.640
How many of you have
heard to Phineas Gage?

00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:20.060
How many of you have not
heard of Phineas Gage?

00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:21.645
OK, time for Phineas Gage.

00:30:21.645 --> 00:30:23.520
OK, but the ones who
have heard of him, let's

00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:24.890
all say this in unison.

00:30:24.890 --> 00:30:28.230
OK, Phineas Gage was the
first identified individual

00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:30.150
to have massive frontal damage.

00:30:30.150 --> 00:30:33.870
Phineas Gage was a foreman
on a railroad construction

00:30:33.870 --> 00:30:36.050
line in Vermont in the 1840s.

00:30:36.050 --> 00:30:39.440
One day, thanks to somebody or
other doing something wrong,

00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:41.820
there was an explosion
of some dynamite, which

00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:44.610
blew a large metal rod
through his forehead

00:30:44.610 --> 00:30:48.020
and out the other side,
taking out his frontal cortex

00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:49.420
in the process.

00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:50.940
And this was rather dramatic.

00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:52.450
And this was this
large metal pole

00:30:52.450 --> 00:30:55.400
that went through fast enough
that, in fact, cauterized

00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:56.550
all the blood vessels.

00:30:56.550 --> 00:30:59.710
And you can see that metal pole
at the museum in the Harvard

00:30:59.710 --> 00:31:01.650
Med School Library,
where you can also

00:31:01.650 --> 00:31:04.120
see his skull, which
is very interesting,

00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:06.970
because the rest of Phineas
Gage is about 20 miles from here

00:31:06.970 --> 00:31:07.920
buried in Colma.

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:10.126
So I don't quite know
how his skull wound up

00:31:10.126 --> 00:31:11.250
at that end of the country.

00:31:11.250 --> 00:31:13.630
But in the either case, he
was buried in San Francisco,

00:31:13.630 --> 00:31:17.140
minus-- well, I guess the Dean
of Harvard Med School swooped

00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:17.640
in.

00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:19.700
And before you knew it,
the skull was on its way

00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:20.950
east there with the metal rod.

00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:23.770
But in any case,
OK, so Phineas Gage

00:31:23.770 --> 00:31:27.180
had his frontal cortex
splattered 15 feet behind him.

00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:29.720
And what happened
was, amazingly,

00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:32.000
because it went through
with such force and so fast,

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.240
that it cauterized
all the blood vessels,

00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:37.940
he was actually, like, able
to get up at that point.

00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:40.500
And, most remarkably, with
a bunch of people from work,

00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:42.930
he was able to walk
a mile and a half

00:31:42.930 --> 00:31:46.440
to the nearest doctor, who
being a good diagnostician,

00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:48.730
took a look at Phineas Gage,
and tilted his head back.

00:31:48.730 --> 00:31:50.271
And looked, and he
said, whoa, you've

00:31:50.271 --> 00:31:52.259
got a hole there in
your head, and was

00:31:52.259 --> 00:31:54.050
sort of looking in more
detail, and saying,

00:31:54.050 --> 00:31:56.920
whoa, you've got frontal cortex
got blown out of your head

00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:57.420
there.

00:31:57.420 --> 00:32:01.330
And this was sort of the peak of
diagnostic skills at the time.

00:32:01.330 --> 00:32:04.986
But what happened was the boss
there on the railroad line

00:32:04.986 --> 00:32:07.860
said, Gage, you know what?

00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:09.120
Take the rest of the day off.

00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:10.210
See you tomorrow.

00:32:10.210 --> 00:32:11.330
So Gage goes home.

00:32:11.330 --> 00:32:14.630
And the next day he returns, not
just figuratively but literally

00:32:14.630 --> 00:32:16.370
transformed overnight.

00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:19.210
Gage, who was this
sober, sobrietous,

00:32:19.210 --> 00:32:22.940
religious man, highly reliable
foreman of this entire work

00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:23.930
place, et cetera.

00:32:23.930 --> 00:32:26.380
Gage was never able
to work a day steadily

00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:27.660
for the rest of his life.

00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:32.420
He became this brawling,
abusive, sexually predatory,

00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:33.880
out of control individual.

00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:37.080
And that original doctor,
seeing what he turned into,

00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:38.580
was the first one
who said, well,

00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:41.390
whatever that part of the brain
was that got taken out there,

00:32:41.390 --> 00:32:43.950
whatever it was, that
part of the brain

00:32:43.950 --> 00:32:46.990
reigns in our animal energies.

00:32:46.990 --> 00:32:51.380
And 170 years later, there's
not a hugely better definition

00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:54.540
out there as to what the
frontal cortex is about.

00:32:54.540 --> 00:32:58.760
So Phineas Gage being
the official first one,

00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:00.280
and you learn all
about this guy.

00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:02.800
But very interestingly,
about a year ago somebody

00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:06.000
found the very first
photograph of Phineas Gage.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.510
And go look at that online.

00:33:07.510 --> 00:33:11.250
What's interesting is he looks
like a perfectly normal guy.

00:33:11.250 --> 00:33:14.280
The pole took out his eye
along with the frontal cortex.

00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:16.840
And, obviously, there
was that problem.

00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:19.860
But this is, like, the face
of somebody from the 1850s.

00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:21.360
And there's something,
I don't know,

00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:23.600
I found very moving
about seeing this face

00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:25.520
that everybody learns
about Phineas Gage.

00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:28.540
And everybody has seen his
skull, and the reconstruction

00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:29.420
of the accident.

00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:30.630
And that's right.

00:33:30.630 --> 00:33:32.830
This was, like, a
regular old person

00:33:32.830 --> 00:33:35.270
whose life was
completely destroyed

00:33:35.270 --> 00:33:37.760
when the frontal
cortex scattered

00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:40.850
all behind him there--
remarkable first example

00:33:40.850 --> 00:33:41.470
of that.

00:33:41.470 --> 00:33:44.730
Since then, most of the evidence
for what frontal cortex is

00:33:44.730 --> 00:33:47.610
about from damage
is older individuals

00:33:47.610 --> 00:33:50.562
who have stroke damage
to the frontal cortex.

00:33:50.562 --> 00:33:52.770
And what I mentioned, I
think, in the limbic lecture,

00:33:52.770 --> 00:33:55.030
one example of what
this looks like was

00:33:55.030 --> 00:33:58.570
a horrifying case in a
facility in the East Bay

00:33:58.570 --> 00:34:01.130
some years ago where
an 80-year-old man who

00:34:01.130 --> 00:34:03.760
had had extensive frontal
damage due to a stroke

00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:06.320
was found to have raped
an 80-year-old woman

00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:07.880
with Alzheimer's disease.

00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:11.699
This is what frontal damage
looks like in an 80-year-old.

00:34:11.699 --> 00:34:14.590
Here's something very
interesting to consider,

00:34:14.590 --> 00:34:16.600
and seeing exactly
the terrain we're

00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:19.530
heading into here with
this sort of information,

00:34:19.530 --> 00:34:25.290
approximately 25% of men on
death row in this country

00:34:25.290 --> 00:34:27.570
have a history of
concussive head trauma

00:34:27.570 --> 00:34:29.600
to the front of their head.

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:32.110
Front of the head,
where you wind up

00:34:32.110 --> 00:34:35.790
damaging the front of the
brain, frontal cortical damage.

00:34:35.790 --> 00:34:39.130
And what we enter into
here is this whole realm

00:34:39.130 --> 00:34:43.400
where this stuff is stupefyingly
relevant to making sense

00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:47.130
of criminal behavior in
humans-- possibilities

00:34:47.130 --> 00:34:48.760
of frontal damage.

00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:51.540
Currently, there
is one law that's

00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:54.190
on the books in the majority
of states in this country

00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:58.470
for deciding when somebody is so
organically impaired that they

00:34:58.470 --> 00:35:00.670
count as having an
insanity defense,

00:35:00.670 --> 00:35:05.300
rather than being criminally
culpable for their acts.

00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:07.800
And this is something
called the McNaughton rule.

00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:09.930
McNaughton rule,
everybody gets taught.

00:35:09.930 --> 00:35:12.750
What the McNaughton rule
is, can the individual

00:35:12.750 --> 00:35:16.020
tell the difference
between right and wrong?

00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:18.640
This is the gold
standard in courts

00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:22.490
as to whether or not somebody
gets a organically impaired

00:35:22.490 --> 00:35:24.560
insanity defense ruling or not.

00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:28.850
McNaughton, whose work was
all of this cutting edge

00:35:28.850 --> 00:35:32.480
neurobiology was based on,
McNaughton was most probably

00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:35.530
a paranoid schizophrenic,
a guy in 1840

00:35:35.530 --> 00:35:38.370
who attempted to assassinate
the Prime Minister of England,

00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:42.170
and was so clearly,
clearly psychotic

00:35:42.170 --> 00:35:43.910
that this was the
first case of the jury

00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:46.640
formally saying that,
no, there is something

00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:50.130
too sick about this man to hold
him responsible for his acts.

00:35:50.130 --> 00:35:52.520
And the clearest thing that
came through in that trial

00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:55.700
was, he could not
distinguish right from wrong.

00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:57.600
And the sort of
thing that absolutely

00:35:57.600 --> 00:36:00.930
does in somebody attempting
to a McNaughton defense

00:36:00.930 --> 00:36:03.030
in a criminal trial
is if there's evidence

00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:06.170
that they tried to cover
their tracks afterward,

00:36:06.170 --> 00:36:09.160
that they were aware that
they had done something

00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:10.570
which was unacceptable.

00:36:10.570 --> 00:36:12.357
What you see with
people who can't

00:36:12.357 --> 00:36:14.190
tell the difference
between right and wrong,

00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:15.700
there is no evidence
of them trying

00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:16.920
to cover up their tracks.

00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:20.020
Where do you see the McNaughton
rule standardly applied?

00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:22.590
Severe, severe schizophrenics.

00:36:22.590 --> 00:36:24.990
And, for example, John
Hinckley, the person

00:36:24.990 --> 00:36:34.580
who tried to assassinate
Reagan in the 1980s,

00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:37.620
and he was found
innocent-- or guilty

00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:40.000
with an insanity
defense, because he

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:43.250
failed a McNaughton ruling,
severe schizophrenic.

00:36:43.250 --> 00:36:46.350
So this has been the gold
standard in most of the courts,

00:36:46.350 --> 00:36:48.120
in most of the states,
in this country.

00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:51.580
The only way you could
be held not accountable

00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:54.530
for your criminal actions
because of organic impairment

00:36:54.530 --> 00:36:56.450
would be if you can't
tell the difference

00:36:56.450 --> 00:36:59.350
between right and wrong.

00:36:59.350 --> 00:37:01.830
But then you've got a problem,
because you get people

00:37:01.830 --> 00:37:03.570
with frontal cortical damage.

00:37:03.570 --> 00:37:06.700
And they can tell the difference
between right and wrong.

00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:07.900
They know the rules.

00:37:07.900 --> 00:37:09.630
They can state them for you.

00:37:09.630 --> 00:37:12.460
Yet, they can't control
their behaviors.

00:37:12.460 --> 00:37:14.680
And this comes through
with all sorts of tests.

00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:18.120
But you could show this now
with people with frontal damage.

00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:21.310
And, for example, here's the
M&amp;M test that you give them.

00:37:21.310 --> 00:37:23.720
And what you've got is
something desirable.

00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:26.280
In this hand, you have
five M&amp;Ms. In this hand,

00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:27.320
you have one.

00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:30.770
And the rule is, if the person
reaches for the five M&amp;Ms,

00:37:30.770 --> 00:37:32.380
you pull your hand away quickly.

00:37:32.380 --> 00:37:34.690
And they get one
M&amp;M as a reward.

00:37:34.690 --> 00:37:37.670
If they reach for the one
M&amp;M, you pull your hand away.

00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:39.470
And you give them five M&amp;Ms.

00:37:39.470 --> 00:37:42.440
In other words, can they
be disciplined enough

00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:45.100
to not reach for the
five M&amp;M, and instead

00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:46.750
hold out and go for one?

00:37:46.750 --> 00:37:48.800
You get more of a
reward that way.

00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:51.930
By doing the harder thing,
you will get more of a reward.

00:37:51.930 --> 00:37:54.600
Extensive frontal
damage, they never,

00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:57.360
ever, ever are able to
reach for the one M&amp;M.

00:37:57.360 --> 00:38:01.160
They always get pulled
towards the easier solution--

00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:03.490
the easier, more
superficial way.

00:38:03.490 --> 00:38:05.790
There's five M&amp;Ms.
That's what I want.

00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:08.550
Instead of being able to
do the executive stepping

00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:12.630
back, and saying, if I go for a
one right now, I will get five.

00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:16.140
What is remarkable is you get an
individual with frontal damage.

00:38:16.140 --> 00:38:18.870
And they will tell
you what the rule is.

00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:21.270
They will sit there
and say, I know.

00:38:21.270 --> 00:38:22.510
I know what you're up to.

00:38:22.510 --> 00:38:24.000
You want me to grab the five.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.125
But then I'll only get one.

00:38:25.125 --> 00:38:28.420
What I need to do is grab the--
and then they go for the five.

00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:31.040
They can verbalize
the rule right there.

00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:34.170
They know the difference
between right and wrong.

00:38:34.170 --> 00:38:37.480
This is not organic impairment
of knowing the rules.

00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:40.800
This is organic impairment of
being able to follow the rules.

00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:44.500
And it is extraordinary
what this one feature

00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:48.040
of what the frontal cortex does,
the difference between knowing

00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:50.480
that there is a difference,
and being able to

00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:52.790
activate this pathway
instead of that.

00:38:52.790 --> 00:38:56.930
This is hugely, hugely
challenging in the courts.

00:38:56.930 --> 00:38:59.800
At the time that Hinckley
attempted to kill Reagan,

00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:01.580
every single state
in the country

00:39:01.580 --> 00:39:03.850
that had a McNaughton
ruling in place-- yeah?

00:39:03.850 --> 00:39:06.048
So for those people that
just have the damage

00:39:06.048 --> 00:39:07.833
and know the rules,
would they cover up

00:39:07.833 --> 00:39:10.411
the tracks in court case so
they would be deemed not worthy

00:39:10.411 --> 00:39:12.480
of the McNaughton rule?

00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:18.240
OK, yeah, would fail the
McNaughton ruling, absolutely,

00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:20.841
because they know the difference
between right and wrong.

00:39:20.841 --> 00:39:22.299
So they would carry
out the action,

00:39:22.299 --> 00:39:24.900
then realize it was
wrong, so try and hide it?

00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:26.010
Yeah, exactly.

00:39:26.010 --> 00:39:28.870
Or if they're disturbed
enough-- OK, for our purposes,

00:39:28.870 --> 00:39:30.870
yes, the person will
know the difference

00:39:30.870 --> 00:39:32.000
between right and wrong.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.040
But they still cannot
regulate their behavior.

00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:37.050
And this is a huge problem.

00:39:37.050 --> 00:39:39.490
What you wind up seeing
is the McNaughton rule

00:39:39.490 --> 00:39:42.440
has generally been accepted in
most states in this country.

00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:46.840
At the time that the Reagan
assassination attempt was made,

00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:50.240
federal criminal rulings
had McNaughton ruling in it.

00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:51.960
Almost all the states
had McNaughton.

00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:55.010
And something, about
10 or 11 of them,

00:39:55.010 --> 00:39:59.890
also had organic impairment of
volitional control recognizing

00:39:59.890 --> 00:40:01.440
realms of frontal damage.

00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:03.020
And what was very
interesting was

00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:05.990
in the aftermath of Hinckley
being found criminally

00:40:05.990 --> 00:40:08.660
insane instead of
guilty, there were

00:40:08.660 --> 00:40:12.920
these neanderthal bellowings
all over the country, editorials

00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:16.060
everywhere, about how Hinckley
had gotten away with it.

00:40:16.060 --> 00:40:19.520
Within a month, the
federal government Congress

00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:22.170
revoked the ability to
have a McNaughton ruling

00:40:22.170 --> 00:40:25.160
in any federal criminal trial.

00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:27.160
The vast majority of
states in this country,

00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:30.080
their legislatures
promptly leapt into action

00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:31.520
to repeal McNaughton.

00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:35.040
And along the way, I think
in all but one or two states,

00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:37.190
the volitional
impairment rulings

00:40:37.190 --> 00:40:38.860
went down the tubes also.

00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:40.960
And at this point,
the vast majority

00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:44.300
of states in this country, you
could have your frontal cortex

00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:46.820
blown out of the water and
you've got one half neuron

00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:48.040
still functioning there.

00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:50.920
And that is not relevant
in a court of law--

00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:54.370
an area that desperately,
desperately needs some reform.

00:40:54.370 --> 00:40:57.510
To give you a sense of how
bizarre this could look,

00:40:57.510 --> 00:40:59.530
this dissociation
here between knowing

00:40:59.530 --> 00:41:01.390
the difference between
right and wrong

00:41:01.390 --> 00:41:04.130
and being able to
regulate your behavior,

00:41:04.130 --> 00:41:07.520
this is what it would look like
in terms of criminal behavior

00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:09.300
with frontal cortical damage.

00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:10.970
And, bizarrely,
this was actually

00:41:10.970 --> 00:41:13.560
a law case I was involved
with some years ago,

00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:15.680
where this was an
individual who had just

00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:18.620
been convicted of his
eighth and ninth murders.

00:41:18.620 --> 00:41:20.770
And this was a serial murderer.

00:41:20.770 --> 00:41:24.690
And he was like a nightmare
beyond imagination,

00:41:24.690 --> 00:41:26.460
what this man was.

00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:28.790
And this eighth and
ninth one had just

00:41:28.790 --> 00:41:33.760
been two boys he had abducted,
kept captive for a week,

00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:38.860
sexually raped, sexually
mutilated, then strangled.

00:41:38.860 --> 00:41:40.770
And this was number
eight and nine.

00:41:40.770 --> 00:41:43.260
And he had been brought
out of a maximum security

00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:46.730
prison in Florida, were
we serving a whole bunch

00:41:46.730 --> 00:41:48.170
of other life sentences.

00:41:48.170 --> 00:41:49.839
And this was a case
down in San Diego

00:41:49.839 --> 00:41:51.380
that he was brought
out for that one.

00:41:51.380 --> 00:41:54.610
And the defense consisted of
three minutes of the defense

00:41:54.610 --> 00:41:57.020
attorneys getting up and
saying, yes, he did it.

00:41:57.020 --> 00:41:58.210
He absolutely did it.

00:41:58.210 --> 00:41:59.480
This was the defense.

00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:02.300
So this was now in the
penalty phase deciding,

00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:04.360
was this person going to
get the death penalty?

00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:06.730
Or was he going to
get life in prison

00:42:06.730 --> 00:42:08.340
without the chance for parole?

00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:10.170
And the relevant
thing about him was

00:42:10.170 --> 00:42:13.610
when he was six years old he had
had a massive car accident that

00:42:13.610 --> 00:42:15.340
destroyed his frontal cortex.

00:42:15.340 --> 00:42:18.230
He spent two months in
a coma, no prior history

00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:22.080
of anti-social behavior, no
family history of any of it.

00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:25.960
Came out of it extremely
behaviorally disinhibited.

00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:29.420
By age 11, he had assaulted his
first individual, first murder

00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:32.970
by age 13-- a completely
broken machine.

00:42:32.970 --> 00:42:35.340
Here's what behavior
looks like in somebody

00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:37.750
with no frontal
cortex in this realm.

00:42:37.750 --> 00:42:39.580
One of the things he
also did, in addition

00:42:39.580 --> 00:42:42.420
to his string of murders,
were kidnapping, and rape,

00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:44.500
and aggravated
assault. And this was

00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:48.010
one woman who had managed to,
fortunately, survive this.

00:42:48.010 --> 00:42:50.810
And she'd been abducted
by him, where he took her

00:42:50.810 --> 00:42:53.650
to his apartment and kept
her there for a week,

00:42:53.650 --> 00:42:56.560
repeatedly raping her,
beating her senseless, days

00:42:56.560 --> 00:42:58.150
and days of this going on.

00:42:58.150 --> 00:43:01.750
And, eventually, whatever it
is that shifted in him shifted.

00:43:01.750 --> 00:43:05.410
He had, of course, her wallet in
the process of kidnapping her,

00:43:05.410 --> 00:43:07.280
and seeing her name,
where she lived,

00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:11.190
he finally says, OK, time to
go, bundles her into his car,

00:43:11.190 --> 00:43:12.750
and drive her home.

00:43:12.750 --> 00:43:16.420
And as he lets her out, he
says, I had a really good time.

00:43:16.420 --> 00:43:17.560
I hope you did too.

00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:18.740
Here's my phone number.

00:43:18.740 --> 00:43:22.650
Maybe we can get together again
sometime, and drives away.

00:43:22.650 --> 00:43:25.960
And no surprise, he was
arrested within an hour or so,

00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:28.940
and eventually sort of
pinned to a whole bunch

00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:29.830
of these other ones.

00:43:29.830 --> 00:43:33.380
This is what it looks like when
you've got no frontal cortex.

00:43:33.380 --> 00:43:37.050
What's interesting there is
he's obviously made no attempt

00:43:37.050 --> 00:43:38.290
to cover his tracks.

00:43:38.290 --> 00:43:41.370
He was able to verbalize
some of these rules,

00:43:41.370 --> 00:43:43.100
and say it was inappropriate.

00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:46.940
And he was able even to be told
the specifics of his own case

00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:49.080
with other names used,
and be able to say,

00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:51.420
whoa, that's not
something you should do.

00:43:51.420 --> 00:43:52.680
That against the law.

00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:56.210
At these junctures, though,
completely going off the rails.

00:43:56.210 --> 00:43:59.070
He had an interesting
combination, though,

00:43:59.070 --> 00:44:00.700
which is that there
were some elements

00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:05.000
of the difference between
right and wrong aspect of it.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:08.730
The fact that he had his frontal
cortex damage so early in life,

00:44:08.730 --> 00:44:13.130
what you tend to see is
around age 5 or 6 or younger,

00:44:13.130 --> 00:44:16.790
the person tends to never quite
incorporate the rules either.

00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:18.700
It's not till you
get-- say, adults

00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:20.160
who get frontal
damage that you get

00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:25.740
the absolutely pure dissociation
between this is not OK to do.

00:44:25.740 --> 00:44:27.520
This is a wrong thing to do.

00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:28.860
I am not going to do it.

00:44:28.860 --> 00:44:30.260
And then goes and does it.

00:44:30.260 --> 00:44:33.060
He, instead, had this much
more mixed case there.

00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:35.370
When you get the frontal
damage around ages five,

00:44:35.370 --> 00:44:37.620
or six, or younger,
you get what is now

00:44:37.620 --> 00:44:40.000
termed acquired sociopothy.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:42.800
You don't do a great
job of incorporating

00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:44.100
the rules themselves.

00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:45.850
And you certainly
can't act on it.

00:44:45.850 --> 00:44:47.990
So this is what it
looks like with someone

00:44:47.990 --> 00:44:51.980
who is that broken in
this part of the brain.

00:44:51.980 --> 00:44:55.475
Ironic ending, first
jury was hungry.

00:44:55.475 --> 00:44:58.740
We got one person to hold
out for organic impairment

00:44:58.740 --> 00:45:01.070
and give him life
without parole.

00:45:01.070 --> 00:45:02.190
So that was a mistrial.

00:45:02.190 --> 00:45:04.689
And second jury went through
the whole thing all over again.

00:45:04.689 --> 00:45:07.390
And it took them three hours
to give him the death penalty.

00:45:07.390 --> 00:45:11.140
So what's very
interesting there is,

00:45:11.140 --> 00:45:14.410
like, 25% of men
on death row have

00:45:14.410 --> 00:45:18.430
a history of concussive trauma
to their frontal cortex--

00:45:18.430 --> 00:45:20.710
really, really interesting.

00:45:20.710 --> 00:45:25.020
But now we begin to see some
of those if-then clauses.

00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:27.870
Here's another individual with
a history of frontal damage.

00:45:27.870 --> 00:45:30.530
And this is a relative of
a close friend of mine.

00:45:30.530 --> 00:45:32.810
And this was someone who
when he was being born

00:45:32.810 --> 00:45:34.580
there was a birth complication.

00:45:34.580 --> 00:45:37.080
And they had to use calipers,
and something slipped,

00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:38.580
and caused frontal damage.

00:45:38.580 --> 00:45:41.380
And frontally disinhibited.

00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:45.200
This is an individual who is now
an adult who is unconstrained

00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:47.130
by the laws of society.

00:45:47.130 --> 00:45:50.730
This is an individual who
cannot regulate his behavior.

00:45:50.730 --> 00:45:51.830
What does he do?

00:45:51.830 --> 00:45:53.780
Whenever there's
family get-togethers,

00:45:53.780 --> 00:45:57.190
he plays the piano way
longer than anybody else

00:45:57.190 --> 00:45:58.250
wants to listen to.

00:45:58.250 --> 00:46:01.040
He can't pick up the cues
that everybody has had enough

00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:02.510
and wants to go eat dinner.

00:46:02.510 --> 00:46:04.130
Well, that was great.

00:46:04.130 --> 00:46:06.400
I think the pot roast is
getting a little cold by now.

00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:07.524
Wasn't that great everyone?

00:46:07.524 --> 00:46:10.210
Wasn't that-- and
just keeps, oh my God.

00:46:10.210 --> 00:46:11.800
He's out of control.

00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:14.420
No less frontal damage
than this guy did.

00:46:14.420 --> 00:46:16.120
So here we have this puzzle.

00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:19.110
We do not have the simple
machine output there,

00:46:19.110 --> 00:46:21.960
of, oh, massive frontal
damage, this person

00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:23.280
is a serial murderer.

00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:24.990
Massive frontal
damage, this person

00:46:24.990 --> 00:46:27.590
plays Scott Joplin
for hours and hours

00:46:27.590 --> 00:46:30.630
until even his grandmother
can't stay in the room anymore.

00:46:30.630 --> 00:46:31.890
What's the difference?

00:46:31.890 --> 00:46:34.900
I think we begin to see
some of our if-then clauses

00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:36.200
perhaps relevant.

00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:39.520
The Scott Joplin playing one,
upper middle class family,

00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:41.460
tremendous family support.

00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:43.470
This guy coming from
a family anything

00:46:43.470 --> 00:46:48.010
but that, we begin to see the,
if you have no frontal cortex

00:46:48.010 --> 00:46:51.530
but you have tremendous
amounts of family support, lots

00:46:51.530 --> 00:46:54.370
of opportunities, blah, blah,
it is going to look different

00:46:54.370 --> 00:46:56.510
than the massive case of it.

00:46:56.510 --> 00:46:59.640
OK, so now looking
at that, what we see

00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:01.640
is there's just a
couple of states

00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:03.637
and the couple of juries
in this country that

00:47:03.637 --> 00:47:05.470
could deal with the
implications of somebody

00:47:05.470 --> 00:47:08.600
having 99% of their
frontal cortex destroyed.

00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:11.690
All you need to do to see the
problem we're up against is,

00:47:11.690 --> 00:47:13.180
what happens if
you've got somebody

00:47:13.180 --> 00:47:18.170
who's got 97% of their frontal
cortex, destroyed or 94%,

00:47:18.170 --> 00:47:18.980
or 85?

00:47:18.980 --> 00:47:22.690
Or finally in our realm, where
we all just have different

00:47:22.690 --> 00:47:23.660
sized ones.

00:47:23.660 --> 00:47:26.920
And the person next to you
has 5% more synapses there,

00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:30.560
or 3% fewer re-uptake
pumps, or whatever.

00:47:30.560 --> 00:47:34.200
That is beginning to get into a
realm that is very challenging.

00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:37.790
OK, so legal implications
there-- enormous ones,

00:47:37.790 --> 00:47:41.390
and ones where reform
is desperately needed.

00:47:41.390 --> 00:47:42.400
This reminds me.

00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:44.320
Here is an example
which strikes me

00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:46.590
as historically quite amazing.

00:47:46.590 --> 00:47:48.610
So we have this
system saying, yes, it

00:47:48.610 --> 00:47:52.320
is possible to be responsible
for your criminal behavior.

00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:53.930
But here's this one exception.

00:47:53.930 --> 00:47:56.960
If you happen to have all
of these neurons destroyed

00:47:56.960 --> 00:47:59.740
and you're in Oregon, you can
have this criminal defense.

00:47:59.740 --> 00:48:00.716
And it's effective.

00:48:00.716 --> 00:48:02.040
Oh yeah, there's this footnote.

00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:04.810
Every now and then,
something can happen so

00:48:04.810 --> 00:48:06.440
that you get into a
different category

00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:10.610
than people who have done
something awful because soul,

00:48:10.610 --> 00:48:13.810
or evil, or whatever
terms are coming in there.

00:48:13.810 --> 00:48:16.030
Really interesting
piece of history--

00:48:16.030 --> 00:48:18.870
16th century, during
the period where

00:48:18.870 --> 00:48:21.620
if you had an epileptic seizure,
you were virtually guaranteed

00:48:21.620 --> 00:48:23.460
to be burned at the
stake as a witch,

00:48:23.460 --> 00:48:25.440
because there was a
medical explanation

00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:29.180
for epilepsy at the time,
which was demonic possession.

00:48:29.180 --> 00:48:31.910
And you were obviously a
witch of some sort or other.

00:48:31.910 --> 00:48:35.450
And, OK, so that was the
medical knowledge of the time.

00:48:35.450 --> 00:48:37.800
And if someone was
accused of a witch in most

00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:41.060
Western European countries where
the Inquisition was occurring,

00:48:41.060 --> 00:48:42.610
the rule of the law
at the time was,

00:48:42.610 --> 00:48:45.170
how do you confirm if
somebody is a witch or not?

00:48:45.170 --> 00:48:47.930
You read them the story
of the crucifixion.

00:48:47.930 --> 00:48:51.030
And if they don't cry,
they are obviously a witch.

00:48:51.030 --> 00:48:52.430
And that was the test.

00:48:52.430 --> 00:48:53.450
That was the legal test.

00:48:53.450 --> 00:48:55.320
If somebody was
not moved to tears

00:48:55.320 --> 00:48:57.170
by the story of Christ
being crucified,

00:48:57.170 --> 00:48:59.410
they were obviously a witch,
and would very quickly

00:48:59.410 --> 00:49:01.590
be burned at the stake.

00:49:01.590 --> 00:49:05.720
At that point, one very,
very progressive physician

00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:09.150
who was up on the top of
behavioral biology insights

00:49:09.150 --> 00:49:13.320
at the time wrote a pamphlet
saying, well, yes, of course,

00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:15.790
we need to get rid of witches
because they're bad news.

00:49:15.790 --> 00:49:16.920
And of course we
should burn them.

00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:18.044
And this is very good test.

00:49:18.044 --> 00:49:20.460
You have to remember,
though, that every now

00:49:20.460 --> 00:49:24.130
and then in some elderly
women the lacrimal glands can

00:49:24.130 --> 00:49:25.190
atrophy.

00:49:25.190 --> 00:49:27.110
So they can't cry.

00:49:27.110 --> 00:49:31.270
So this would be someone who
is involuntarily unable to cry,

00:49:31.270 --> 00:49:32.794
rather than they're a witch.

00:49:32.794 --> 00:49:34.210
You just need to
keep that in mind

00:49:34.210 --> 00:49:36.210
when you do some of that
witch sentencing stuff.

00:49:36.210 --> 00:49:39.040
Sometimes it could be due
to this organic impairment

00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:39.580
business.

00:49:39.580 --> 00:49:43.140
But the overall structure, yeah,
let's get rid of those witches.

00:49:43.140 --> 00:49:45.030
And that's a very good
way of getting at it.

00:49:45.030 --> 00:49:46.930
That makes no sense at all.

00:49:46.930 --> 00:49:50.460
I suspect ultimately saying that
in a small handful of places,

00:49:50.460 --> 00:49:52.830
if you have no
frontal cortex at all,

00:49:52.830 --> 00:49:54.310
we're talking about neurology.

00:49:54.310 --> 00:49:55.840
If you've got any
frontal cortex,

00:49:55.840 --> 00:49:59.470
we're talking about morality,
and soul, and even all of that.

00:49:59.470 --> 00:50:02.460
I suspect it will eventually
make as little sense

00:50:02.460 --> 00:50:06.150
as lacrimal glands drying up.

00:50:06.150 --> 00:50:08.114
OK, I'm obviously just
on the edge of tirading.

00:50:08.114 --> 00:50:09.530
So let's take a
five minute break.

00:50:09.530 --> 00:50:12.524
And we will continue.

00:50:12.524 --> 00:50:14.690
Frontal cortex [? of ?]
[? viewers, ?] keeping track

00:50:14.690 --> 00:50:18.060
of all those different rules,
and keeping you from belching

00:50:18.060 --> 00:50:19.530
loudly in the
middle of a lecture,

00:50:19.530 --> 00:50:22.040
and all those other frontal
cortical sort of tasks.

00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:27.526
What's the time of day when your
frontal cortex is least active?

00:50:27.526 --> 00:50:28.025
Any guesses?

00:50:31.260 --> 00:50:33.713
OK, wait somebody
say something clear.

00:50:33.713 --> 00:50:34.460
Late at night.

00:50:34.460 --> 00:50:36.325
Late at night,
when late at night?

00:50:36.325 --> 00:50:37.200
When you're sleeping.

00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:40.730
When you're sleeping,
when when you're sleeping?

00:50:40.730 --> 00:50:43.780
REM sleep-- REM sleep,
your frontal cortex

00:50:43.780 --> 00:50:45.830
basically shuts down entirely.

00:50:45.830 --> 00:50:48.529
That's why your
dreams make no sense.

00:50:48.529 --> 00:50:50.070
That's where your
dreams you're doing

00:50:50.070 --> 00:50:53.430
all sorts of things you would
never want to do in real life.

00:50:53.430 --> 00:50:55.230
The thing about
the frontal cortex

00:50:55.230 --> 00:50:58.940
is that it keeps you from doing
and saying the sort of stuff

00:50:58.940 --> 00:51:01.530
that all of us contemplate
at various times,

00:51:01.530 --> 00:51:05.070
but we would die if anybody
knew we were thinking that.

00:51:05.070 --> 00:51:08.770
You wipe out the frontal
cortex, and you do it.

00:51:08.770 --> 00:51:10.887
Or you take the
frontal cortex offline

00:51:10.887 --> 00:51:11.970
in the middle of dreaming.

00:51:11.970 --> 00:51:15.260
And, suddenly, that seems like
a wonderfully prudent thing

00:51:15.260 --> 00:51:17.840
to be doing with yourself
in the middle of a dream.

00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:21.030
That's when the frontal
cortex is least active.

00:51:21.030 --> 00:51:23.770
OK, so now frontal
cortex, looking

00:51:23.770 --> 00:51:26.060
at one of its most
distinctive, interesting things

00:51:26.060 --> 00:51:28.490
about its function,
its development.

00:51:28.490 --> 00:51:31.065
When does it
develop after birth?

00:51:31.065 --> 00:51:32.690
And I think what I've
already mentioned

00:51:32.690 --> 00:51:35.230
is the frontal
cortex is interesting

00:51:35.230 --> 00:51:39.700
because it's the last part of
your brain to fully develop.

00:51:39.700 --> 00:51:42.880
It is the last part of
your brain to fully form

00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:45.650
all of the myelin on its axons.

00:51:45.650 --> 00:51:48.560
It's the last part to get
its full large complement

00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:51.750
of synapses, and branching
connections, and such.

00:51:51.750 --> 00:51:54.250
It's the last part of
the brain to develop.

00:51:54.250 --> 00:51:58.360
When does the frontal cortex, on
the average, completely mature,

00:51:58.360 --> 00:52:00.310
go online for the first time?

00:52:00.310 --> 00:52:05.100
Around age 25, which
is astonishing,

00:52:05.100 --> 00:52:08.020
which among other things
should be reckoned

00:52:08.020 --> 00:52:10.490
in the context that,
probably, all sorts of you

00:52:10.490 --> 00:52:13.940
guys still have a whole lot
more myelin to lay down there

00:52:13.940 --> 00:52:15.170
in the frontal cortex.

00:52:15.170 --> 00:52:17.920
It is the last part of the
brain to fully develop.

00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:21.270
Some immediate implications
of that-- if it

00:52:21.270 --> 00:52:24.000
is the last part of the
brain to develop, it is,

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:26.010
by definition, the
part of the brain

00:52:26.010 --> 00:52:28.480
least constrained by genes.

00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:32.280
And it is the part of the brain
most sculpted by environment

00:52:32.280 --> 00:52:35.510
and experience, which is
real interesting, given

00:52:35.510 --> 00:52:38.760
that it is the most definedly
human part of the brain.

00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:42.010
So frontal cortical development
in kids-- what we've already

00:52:42.010 --> 00:52:46.010
heard is by age 5 or
younger, get frontal damage,

00:52:46.010 --> 00:52:48.020
and you get this
acquired sociopathy.

00:52:48.020 --> 00:52:51.325
You don't get as clear of a
disassociation between you

00:52:51.325 --> 00:52:54.370
know what the rules are, you
simply can't carry them out.

00:52:54.370 --> 00:52:57.250
It's more of a mixed
bag at that point.

00:52:57.250 --> 00:52:59.890
Frontal development after
that-- the frontal cortex

00:52:59.890 --> 00:53:02.870
works in a very interesting,
perfectly logical way

00:53:02.870 --> 00:53:05.260
in teenagers, as follows.

00:53:05.260 --> 00:53:07.350
When you look at
frontal activity,

00:53:07.350 --> 00:53:08.940
and the extent to
which it is being

00:53:08.940 --> 00:53:12.060
driven by dopamine with one
of these brain scanners,

00:53:12.060 --> 00:53:14.730
take an adult, and
take a teenager.

00:53:14.730 --> 00:53:17.720
And they each have circumstances
where they're doing some task

00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:18.990
and they get a reward.

00:53:18.990 --> 00:53:21.270
And some of the time,
they get a smaller reward

00:53:21.270 --> 00:53:23.520
than they think they deserve
from the amount of effort

00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:24.270
they put in.

00:53:24.270 --> 00:53:27.710
And some of the time, they get
an unexpectedly large reward.

00:53:27.710 --> 00:53:30.920
Circumstance where the
individual gets a bigger reward

00:53:30.920 --> 00:53:34.210
than anticipated,
dopamine goes up in adults

00:53:34.210 --> 00:53:37.080
and drives frontal metabolism
to a certain extent.

00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:40.670
Dopamine goes up much
higher in the teenager.

00:53:40.670 --> 00:53:44.120
Now a circumstance where the
task is being carried out.

00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:46.480
And you don't get the reward.

00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:48.790
Dopamine goes down in the
adult, frontal metabolism

00:53:48.790 --> 00:53:49.820
goes down a bit.

00:53:49.820 --> 00:53:53.200
Dopamine goes down much
more in the teenager.

00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:56.070
The gyrations are
much more extreme.

00:53:56.070 --> 00:54:00.200
The dopamine-driven metabolic
changes in the frontal cortex

00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:02.950
are more dramatically
large for reward,

00:54:02.950 --> 00:54:05.860
are more dramatically
having the floor fall out

00:54:05.860 --> 00:54:08.880
under it for lack of
reward, for disappointment.

00:54:08.880 --> 00:54:11.970
It's a system that is
simply less regulated.

00:54:11.970 --> 00:54:14.700
And this, this fact that the
frontal cortex is the last

00:54:14.700 --> 00:54:18.070
maturing part of the brain, had
to do with one of the wisest

00:54:18.070 --> 00:54:20.360
things the Supreme Court
has done in a long time,

00:54:20.360 --> 00:54:23.470
which was about 10 years ago,
when they made a ruling that

00:54:23.470 --> 00:54:26.340
individuals who
are under age 18,

00:54:26.340 --> 00:54:28.770
when they carry out
a capital crime,

00:54:28.770 --> 00:54:31.880
you cannot have the death
penalty applied to someone

00:54:31.880 --> 00:54:35.130
for a crime they did
between ages 16 and 18,

00:54:35.130 --> 00:54:38.440
because explicitly stated
in the court decision,

00:54:38.440 --> 00:54:41.720
the brain and the regulatory
areas of the brain are not

00:54:41.720 --> 00:54:45.830
fully mature at that point--
the most neurologically informed

00:54:45.830 --> 00:54:47.800
the Supreme Court has
been in a long time.

00:54:47.800 --> 00:54:51.060
Again, the McNaughton rule--
the McNaughton rule, which

00:54:51.060 --> 00:54:53.940
is the backbone of the criminal
defense and legal system

00:54:53.940 --> 00:54:59.070
in this country, is based on
170-year-old neurobiology.

00:54:59.070 --> 00:55:02.216
So this was a major leap
forward in jurisprudence

00:55:02.216 --> 00:55:04.590
meets neurobiology in this
country with the Supreme Court

00:55:04.590 --> 00:55:05.160
ruling.

00:55:05.160 --> 00:55:08.080
Of course, what
one might ask is,

00:55:08.080 --> 00:55:10.630
so what exactly happens in
the brain on the morning

00:55:10.630 --> 00:55:12.800
of your 18th birthday
that now makes

00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:15.444
it OK to put you to death,
where the science simply

00:55:15.444 --> 00:55:16.110
doesn't back it?

00:55:16.110 --> 00:55:19.600
But at least that recognition,
the Supreme Court actually

00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:23.090
dealing with the fact that
a 17-year-old does not have

00:55:23.090 --> 00:55:25.930
a normal frontal cortex yet.

00:55:25.930 --> 00:55:28.330
What else goes on?

00:55:28.330 --> 00:55:31.210
Thus, by the time you get a
fully online frontal cortex,

00:55:31.210 --> 00:55:34.800
around age 25 or so, one of
the truly depressing things

00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:37.540
out the other end of it
is the frontal cortex

00:55:37.540 --> 00:55:42.790
is the third most vulnerable
brain region to normal aging--

00:55:42.790 --> 00:55:43.790
bummer.

00:55:43.790 --> 00:55:45.140
That is a drag.

00:55:45.140 --> 00:55:48.230
What that winds up meaning is
you have spectacular impulse

00:55:48.230 --> 00:55:50.070
control for about
three and a half weeks

00:55:50.070 --> 00:55:51.580
on your 25th birthday.

00:55:51.580 --> 00:55:53.356
And it's all
downhill from there.

00:55:53.356 --> 00:55:55.730
There's a motor system in the
brain called the substantia

00:55:55.730 --> 00:55:59.300
nigra which loses most of
its neurons with aging.

00:55:59.300 --> 00:56:01.520
That has something to do
with the tremor of old age,

00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:02.880
Parkinson's disease.

00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:06.310
The hippocampus lose substantial
percentage of its neurons

00:56:06.310 --> 00:56:06.870
with age.

00:56:06.870 --> 00:56:09.350
That has something to do with
some of the memory problems.

00:56:09.350 --> 00:56:12.410
Number three on the list
is the frontal cortex.

00:56:12.410 --> 00:56:15.200
Frontal cortex loses
lots of neurons

00:56:15.200 --> 00:56:16.640
over the course of aging.

00:56:16.640 --> 00:56:19.370
And what you see, then,
is all of those tests

00:56:19.370 --> 00:56:22.010
of cognitive function,
of frontal functioning,

00:56:22.010 --> 00:56:24.650
they all have to be
age-adjusted because people

00:56:24.650 --> 00:56:28.670
as they get older have more
trouble doing this, inhibiting

00:56:28.670 --> 00:56:31.590
the over-learned response,
preventing something

00:56:31.590 --> 00:56:33.270
from intruding previously.

00:56:33.270 --> 00:56:36.530
There's fewer of these
projections coming in there.

00:56:36.530 --> 00:56:38.470
And what does this
begin to explain?

00:56:38.470 --> 00:56:41.990
This is this whole world
of grandmothers telling you

00:56:41.990 --> 00:56:45.260
exactly how hideous they
think your new hairdo is.

00:56:45.260 --> 00:56:48.560
That's the world of disinhibited
80-year-olds speaking.

00:56:48.560 --> 00:56:51.150
And what has always been
the case in that literature,

00:56:51.150 --> 00:56:54.940
it has always been interpreted
in a social, psychological

00:56:54.940 --> 00:56:56.710
maturation framework.

00:56:56.710 --> 00:56:59.400
By the time you get
to a certain age,

00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:01.990
you finally accept,
this is who I am.

00:57:01.990 --> 00:57:05.040
I'm not in middle school anymore
just trying to be popular.

00:57:05.040 --> 00:57:07.140
If I need to march to
a different drummer,

00:57:07.140 --> 00:57:09.690
so be it, because I am
at peace with who I am.

00:57:09.690 --> 00:57:10.610
I accept myself.

00:57:10.610 --> 00:57:11.430
It's not that.

00:57:11.430 --> 00:57:12.770
It's the brain damage.

00:57:12.770 --> 00:57:16.320
It's the brain damage that kicks
in at that point, that being

00:57:16.320 --> 00:57:19.190
a feature of normative aging.

00:57:19.190 --> 00:57:22.220
Now, where else do you wind
up seeing abnormalities

00:57:22.220 --> 00:57:23.630
and frontal function?

00:57:23.630 --> 00:57:26.100
Other individuals,
individual differences--

00:57:26.100 --> 00:57:28.750
one personality
style where you see

00:57:28.750 --> 00:57:30.940
elevated frontal metabolism.

00:57:30.940 --> 00:57:32.620
And this is people
with what's called

00:57:32.620 --> 00:57:34.910
repressive personalities.

00:57:34.910 --> 00:57:38.840
These are individuals who
are highly regimented, highly

00:57:38.840 --> 00:57:43.150
disciplined, highly capable
of controlling their behavior.

00:57:43.150 --> 00:57:46.640
These are individuals who do not
express emotions very readily.

00:57:46.640 --> 00:57:49.810
They're very bad at reading
emotions in other people.

00:57:49.810 --> 00:57:50.830
They're not depressed.

00:57:50.830 --> 00:57:51.700
They're not anxious.

00:57:51.700 --> 00:57:54.590
In order to be labeled with
a repressive personality,

00:57:54.590 --> 00:57:55.740
those are rule-outs.

00:57:55.740 --> 00:57:58.240
You have an extremely
structured life.

00:57:58.240 --> 00:58:01.170
These are the people
who can tell you

00:58:01.170 --> 00:58:03.630
everything they're planning to
do for the next three years.

00:58:03.630 --> 00:58:05.090
And it's already scheduled out.

00:58:05.090 --> 00:58:07.770
This is the roommate who
always has all the work

00:58:07.770 --> 00:58:09.717
done three weeks
before the due date.

00:58:09.717 --> 00:58:11.300
This is the person
who makes you crazy

00:58:11.300 --> 00:58:13.341
because you wish you could
be half as disciplined

00:58:13.341 --> 00:58:14.230
as they are.

00:58:14.230 --> 00:58:16.410
People with
personalities like this,

00:58:16.410 --> 00:58:20.600
elevated resting metabolism
in the frontal cortex.

00:58:20.600 --> 00:58:24.520
So which sort of people have
far lower than normal metabolism

00:58:24.520 --> 00:58:26.390
in the frontal cortex?

00:58:26.390 --> 00:58:27.260
Any guesses?

00:58:27.260 --> 00:58:27.990
Shout out.

00:58:31.336 --> 00:58:32.770
Thrill seekers.

00:58:32.770 --> 00:58:35.180
Thrill seekers,
yeah-- thrill seekers,

00:58:35.180 --> 00:58:37.890
it seems to be more at the
dopamine end of things.

00:58:37.890 --> 00:58:41.170
And the zebra book considers
that at one point in there.

00:58:41.170 --> 00:58:43.400
When it's more
manifest in, how are

00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:45.630
you going to pull
off stuff like this,

00:58:45.630 --> 00:58:49.530
sociopaths have much lower
than normal metabolic rates

00:58:49.530 --> 00:58:50.732
in the frontal cortex.

00:58:50.732 --> 00:58:52.190
In fact, in a couple
of weeks there

00:58:52.190 --> 00:58:53.930
is a guy coming to
give a lecture--

00:58:53.930 --> 00:58:55.786
and I'll announce in
here when and where--

00:58:55.786 --> 00:58:57.410
who is one of the
people doing the most

00:58:57.410 --> 00:58:58.580
interesting work with this.

00:58:58.580 --> 00:59:01.800
What this guy has is a
functional MRI machine

00:59:01.800 --> 00:59:03.990
on a trailer, which
he drives around

00:59:03.990 --> 00:59:06.460
from one maximum security
prison to another

00:59:06.460 --> 00:59:09.560
throughout this country--
really interesting research

00:59:09.560 --> 00:59:13.390
on violent individuals who
are or aren't sociopathic,

00:59:13.390 --> 00:59:15.780
decreased frontal metabolism.

00:59:15.780 --> 00:59:17.170
But now something interesting.

00:59:17.170 --> 00:59:20.530
You take a sociopath whose
resting metabolic rate

00:59:20.530 --> 00:59:23.680
in the frontal cortex
is lower than normal.

00:59:23.680 --> 00:59:27.480
Now you give them a task
which demands a certain degree

00:59:27.480 --> 00:59:29.070
of frontal function.

00:59:29.070 --> 00:59:32.090
Not, oh, be a law abiding
citizen in society,

00:59:32.090 --> 00:59:34.270
but something like the
tell the months of the year

00:59:34.270 --> 00:59:36.330
backwards as fast as you can go.

00:59:36.330 --> 00:59:38.990
And what you see is
in order to generate

00:59:38.990 --> 00:59:42.060
the same level of
performance, they

00:59:42.060 --> 00:59:44.590
have to activate more
of the frontal cortex

00:59:44.590 --> 00:59:45.835
than other people do.

00:59:45.835 --> 00:59:48.980
In other words, under
resting circumstances,

00:59:48.980 --> 00:59:52.480
there is a hypometabolism
in the frontal cortex.

00:59:52.480 --> 00:59:55.990
And in the rare, relatively
unemotional circumstances

00:59:55.990 --> 00:59:59.610
where a sociopath does want to
pull off a lot of regulation

00:59:59.610 --> 01:00:02.280
of behavior, they've got
to recruit a lot more

01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:04.200
of the frontal cortex to do it.

01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:07.040
It takes more work to do.

01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:09.230
Other aspects of
frontal cortex--

01:00:09.230 --> 01:00:12.110
not only are kids not
dealing with a whole lot

01:00:12.110 --> 01:00:13.220
of frontal cortex.

01:00:13.220 --> 01:00:15.340
Other species are not
dealing with a whole lot

01:00:15.340 --> 01:00:16.600
of frontal cortex.

01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:19.670
Again, humans have more
frontal cortex proportionately

01:00:19.670 --> 01:00:21.150
than any other species.

01:00:21.150 --> 01:00:23.400
There is no chimpanzee
on Earth who

01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:26.330
could master the five
M&amp;M, one M&amp;M task.

01:00:26.330 --> 01:00:29.370
And that is regularly used as
a test for frontal function

01:00:29.370 --> 01:00:29.900
on them.

01:00:29.900 --> 01:00:34.010
Chimps cannot do it because it
is simply too tempting to reach

01:00:34.010 --> 01:00:37.950
for the five M&amp;Md
because it's right there.

01:00:37.950 --> 01:00:41.670
Interesting assay of how many
frontal neurons a chimp does

01:00:41.670 --> 01:00:46.320
have, though, which is now
instead of 5 M&amp;Ms and 1 M&amp;M,

01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:49.200
five chips of wood
and one chip of wood.

01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:53.420
Reach for the five chips
of wood, you get one M&amp;M.

01:00:53.420 --> 01:00:57.480
Reach for the one chip of
wood, you get five M&amp;Ms.

01:00:57.480 --> 01:00:59.080
Every chimp can do it now.

01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:01.350
They can all do it now
because they're just looking

01:01:01.350 --> 01:01:02.591
at these pieces of wood.

01:01:02.591 --> 01:01:04.090
And they can remember,
that's right.

01:01:04.090 --> 01:01:05.540
Don't go for the
five pieces of wood.

01:01:05.540 --> 01:01:06.748
Go for the one piece of wood.

01:01:06.748 --> 01:01:08.720
When it's chocolate,
though, in front of them,

01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:11.290
it's smells so great.

01:01:11.290 --> 01:01:14.110
And how can you expect them
to keep track of the rules?

01:01:14.110 --> 01:01:15.862
And it's just the five.

01:01:15.862 --> 01:01:18.070
And before you know it,
they've done the wrong thing.

01:01:18.070 --> 01:01:20.770
If you take away some
of the viscera of it,

01:01:20.770 --> 01:01:24.210
if you step back sensorially,
if you substitute

01:01:24.210 --> 01:01:27.190
this in your face chocolate
for these little bits of wood,

01:01:27.190 --> 01:01:29.870
chimps on the average have
enough frontal function

01:01:29.870 --> 01:01:33.300
to be able to pull
that task off.

01:01:33.300 --> 01:01:35.330
Kids, again, could
never do this.

01:01:35.330 --> 01:01:38.090
And this is one classic
sort of developmental test.

01:01:38.090 --> 01:01:39.130
You take a kid.

01:01:39.130 --> 01:01:40.390
And they're in a room.

01:01:40.390 --> 01:01:42.080
And you put a marshmallow there.

01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:46.010
And you say, OK, does
people know this one?

01:01:46.010 --> 01:01:49.700
OK, so do people
now know this one?

01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:50.880
OK, so here's what you do.

01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:52.130
You put the marshmallow there.

01:01:52.130 --> 01:01:54.132
And you tell the child,
OK, I've got to go out

01:01:54.132 --> 01:01:55.340
of the room for a little bit.

01:01:55.340 --> 01:01:57.214
You can have a marshmallow
whenever you want.

01:01:57.214 --> 01:01:59.960
But if you haven't had it
by the time I come back,

01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:01.370
you can have two marshmallows.

01:02:01.370 --> 01:02:03.670
In other words,
how many synapses

01:02:03.670 --> 01:02:05.850
do you have in your
frontal cortex?

01:02:05.850 --> 01:02:08.740
Because that is
spectacularly predictive

01:02:08.740 --> 01:02:11.230
of frontal metabolism
in these kids.

01:02:11.230 --> 01:02:15.160
How long can they hold out
doing the harder thing that

01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:16.570
gets more of a reward?

01:02:16.570 --> 01:02:18.310
What those studies
also were showing

01:02:18.310 --> 01:02:20.850
is the length of time
a kid could hold out

01:02:20.850 --> 01:02:23.370
on the marshmallow test
when they're five years old

01:02:23.370 --> 01:02:27.410
is predictive of SAT
scores many years later,

01:02:27.410 --> 01:02:31.620
is predictive of all sorts
of aspects of the trajectory

01:02:31.620 --> 01:02:34.520
of that frontal development.

01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:37.390
Here's an even better assay
for frontal function in a kid.

01:02:37.390 --> 01:02:40.287
And this one, I think this
is even more informative

01:02:40.287 --> 01:02:41.370
than the marshmallow test.

01:02:41.370 --> 01:02:42.350
Here's what you do.

01:02:42.350 --> 01:02:43.600
You've got your five-year-old.

01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:46.310
And you play hide
and seek with them.

01:02:46.310 --> 01:02:49.160
And the deal is you're
the one who counts first

01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:50.160
while they go and hide.

01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:51.870
And what you do is
you finish counting.

01:02:51.870 --> 01:02:54.850
And then you loudly,
excitedly say, here I come.

01:02:54.850 --> 01:02:55.351
Here I come.

01:02:55.351 --> 01:02:56.225
I'm going to get you.

01:02:56.225 --> 01:02:56.880
Here I come.

01:02:56.880 --> 01:02:58.150
Oh, where are you?

01:02:58.150 --> 01:03:01.070
And then they instantly say,
right here under the piano,

01:03:01.070 --> 01:03:03.380
because they don't have
enough frontal neurons to keep

01:03:03.380 --> 01:03:04.607
themselves from saying that.

01:03:04.607 --> 01:03:06.690
They can't stop themselves
from saying, here I am.

01:03:06.690 --> 01:03:08.000
Here I am, falling for that.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.250
Now, they switch.

01:03:09.250 --> 01:03:10.730
And it's their turn to count.

01:03:10.730 --> 01:03:11.450
And they count.

01:03:11.450 --> 01:03:12.480
You count up to 10.

01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:15.940
And they go 7, 8, 9,
10, 11, 12, 13, 14,

01:03:15.940 --> 01:03:18.460
because they're so excited
to have discovered recently

01:03:18.460 --> 01:03:23.250
there's all these numbers, that
why not count all of them off?

01:03:23.250 --> 01:03:26.450
And they've long forgotten
you're supposed to stop at 10.

01:03:26.450 --> 01:03:28.630
They can't inhibit
that response.

01:03:28.630 --> 01:03:31.810
This is what frontal function
looks like in a kid--

01:03:31.810 --> 01:03:34.680
so marshmallow tests
and hide and seek tests.

01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:37.220
How's this, though, for
taking that charming world

01:03:37.220 --> 01:03:39.680
of five-year-old
regulation and putting it

01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:43.440
into a much more depressing
developmental context?

01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:49.200
Studies by now showing at age 5,
already kindergarten-aged kids,

01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:52.660
there is a relationship between
your socioeconomic status

01:03:52.660 --> 01:03:55.240
and the thickness of
your frontal cortex

01:03:55.240 --> 01:03:57.910
and its resting metabolic rate.

01:03:57.910 --> 01:03:59.420
What's the part
of the brain that

01:03:59.420 --> 01:04:01.690
has some of the highest
levels of receptors

01:04:01.690 --> 01:04:03.410
for glucocorticoids?

01:04:03.410 --> 01:04:04.870
The frontal cortex.

01:04:04.870 --> 01:04:08.060
What do glucocorticoids
do to the frontal cortex?

01:04:08.060 --> 01:04:10.200
They atrophy neurons there.

01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:12.240
So what you are
already seeing is,

01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:15.450
get yourself an unfortunate,
imprudent decision

01:04:15.450 --> 01:04:18.300
in terms of which family
you got yourself born into.

01:04:18.300 --> 01:04:20.630
And be raised with
the stress of poverty.

01:04:20.630 --> 01:04:24.380
And by age 5, already there
are socioeconomic differences

01:04:24.380 --> 01:04:27.570
in the size and the activity
of the frontal cortex.

01:04:27.570 --> 01:04:30.580
And that is, I think, one
of those factoids that

01:04:30.580 --> 01:04:33.830
should have people rioting
at the barricades in terms

01:04:33.830 --> 01:04:38.010
of how screwed you are, how
early on in life in the most

01:04:38.010 --> 01:04:41.460
straight forwardly
neurobiological way by some

01:04:41.460 --> 01:04:45.370
of these oddities of
experience and bad luck.

01:04:45.370 --> 01:04:49.640
OK, so looking finally at the
frontal cortex-- one thing

01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:54.120
to ask at the end of the day
is, so, frontal disinhibition?

01:04:54.120 --> 01:04:57.490
Why don't you see with people
with massive frontal damage,

01:04:57.490 --> 01:04:59.610
instead of them becoming
serial murderers,

01:04:59.610 --> 01:05:03.060
why don't they become like
serial people getting married?

01:05:03.060 --> 01:05:06.530
Why aren't they serial standing
on street corners giving away

01:05:06.530 --> 01:05:09.540
their money and announcing
their love to the whole world,

01:05:09.540 --> 01:05:12.890
and doing equally disinhibited
things in that realm?

01:05:12.890 --> 01:05:13.890
It's not clear.

01:05:13.890 --> 01:05:17.910
It's not clear why this is
so much more tightly involved

01:05:17.910 --> 01:05:21.150
in regulation of stuff
going on in the amygdala.

01:05:21.150 --> 01:05:24.080
OK, so as implied,
though, by this arrow,

01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:26.730
it is not one direction
of inputs there.

01:05:26.730 --> 01:05:28.160
It is bidirectional.

01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:32.000
What you also see is a lot of
ways in which the amygdala can

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:33.970
regulate the frontal cortex.

01:05:33.970 --> 01:05:36.350
And what you already can
guess is the projection

01:05:36.350 --> 01:05:39.600
from the frontal cortex to
the amygdala is inhibitory.

01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:42.720
The projection from the
amygdala to the frontal cortex

01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:44.260
is inhibitory.

01:05:44.260 --> 01:05:46.910
The frontal cortex is
trying to get the amygdala

01:05:46.910 --> 01:05:48.680
to restrain itself.

01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:51.160
The amygdala is trying
to get the frontal cortex

01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:53.000
to stop sermonizing at it.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:56.160
And what you wind up seeing
is in rats, in primates,

01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:59.160
and humans there is
an inverse correlation

01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:02.480
under resting conditions
between the metabolic level

01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:04.850
in the amygdala and
the frontal cortex.

01:06:04.850 --> 01:06:08.310
They move in opposition.

01:06:08.310 --> 01:06:11.540
And what you see is, what
are the circumstances where,

01:06:11.540 --> 01:06:15.230
in effect, the amygdala is going
crazy enough to be silencing

01:06:15.230 --> 01:06:16.620
the frontal cortex?

01:06:16.620 --> 01:06:18.170
That's the world
in which you are

01:06:18.170 --> 01:06:22.230
making astonishingly bad
decisions about things

01:06:22.230 --> 01:06:24.600
during moments of great
duress and arousal

01:06:24.600 --> 01:06:26.750
that you spend the rest
of your life regretting.

01:06:26.750 --> 01:06:30.780
That's the world of the amygdala
getting very inaccurate, rapid

01:06:30.780 --> 01:06:34.870
fire information, and being able
to silence the frontal cortex.

01:06:34.870 --> 01:06:38.730
And then out comes behavior
that is really unregulated.

01:06:38.730 --> 01:06:41.380
The frontal cortex and
the amygdala, in a sense,

01:06:41.380 --> 01:06:46.150
constantly wrestling in
terms of their reciprocity.

01:06:46.150 --> 01:06:48.950
So what happens when
somebody has learned

01:06:48.950 --> 01:06:50.390
to be afraid of something?

01:06:50.390 --> 01:06:53.740
And slowly, over time, they
learn that, in fact, this thing

01:06:53.740 --> 01:06:55.300
is not fearful?

01:06:55.300 --> 01:06:59.120
They habituate to this
fear-conditioned response.

01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:02.060
They habituate to yoking.

01:07:02.060 --> 01:07:04.700
This buzzer means I'm
going to get a shock.

01:07:04.700 --> 01:07:06.600
They extinguish the behavior.

01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:08.380
That's the term given for that.

01:07:08.380 --> 01:07:11.660
You gradually see the amygdala
activates less and less.

01:07:11.660 --> 01:07:13.479
Oh, play the buzzer,
play the tone,

01:07:13.479 --> 01:07:15.770
that you've been conditioned
to associate with a shock.

01:07:15.770 --> 01:07:17.560
Amygdala goes crazy.

01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:19.810
No shock this time,
do the buzzer again,

01:07:19.810 --> 01:07:21.560
no shock, not quite as active.

01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:25.010
Next time, not quite as active,
and it slowly habituates away.

01:07:25.010 --> 01:07:27.600
Destroy the frontal
cortex, and the amygdala

01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:30.820
never habituates to
a learned response,

01:07:30.820 --> 01:07:34.350
a fear-conditioned response
which is no longer fearful.

01:07:34.350 --> 01:07:37.200
It can't learn to
stop being afraid--

01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:40.750
so another realm of this
reciprocal inhibitory

01:07:40.750 --> 01:07:46.430
relationship between the
frontal cortex and the amygdala.

01:07:46.430 --> 01:07:50.030
OK, final bit here in terms
of their interactions--

01:07:50.030 --> 01:07:53.410
the easiest way to frame it
is, each inhibits the other.

01:07:53.410 --> 01:07:55.000
They work reciprocally.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:58.490
There are circumstances, though,
where both the frontal cortex

01:07:58.490 --> 01:08:02.030
and the amygdala will activate
because all you have to think

01:08:02.030 --> 01:08:04.850
are of some circumstances
where whatever

01:08:04.850 --> 01:08:08.770
your cultural conditioning is,
doing the harder thing, which

01:08:08.770 --> 01:08:11.980
is the right thing, is
also the scarier thing.

01:08:11.980 --> 01:08:14.540
Just think what it takes to
have somebody blow a whistle.

01:08:14.540 --> 01:08:17.729
And you leap up over the top
of your trench in World War I.

01:08:17.729 --> 01:08:19.810
And you're going
to be dead 10 steps

01:08:19.810 --> 01:08:22.029
into running towards
the other trench line.

01:08:22.029 --> 01:08:24.279
At some point,
the frontal cortex

01:08:24.279 --> 01:08:27.840
is, in fact, stimulating
the amygdala very strongly

01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:29.490
to produce its behaviors.

01:08:29.490 --> 01:08:32.240
That's showing a circumstance
where that is, indeed,

01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:33.160
the harder behavior.

01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:37.200
It is simplifying to say that
they always work in opposition.

01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:39.399
But as a general rule,
that's happening.

01:08:39.399 --> 01:08:42.689
OK, what this allows us
do now is step back a bit

01:08:42.689 --> 01:08:45.430
and now look at another
brain region, one

01:08:45.430 --> 01:08:48.270
which is in effect
working in opposition

01:08:48.270 --> 01:08:52.199
to the amygdala in another
realm, which is the septum.

01:08:52.199 --> 01:08:53.720
And you remember the septum.

01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:57.229
The hippocampus sends its
loop through the fornix

01:08:57.229 --> 01:08:58.710
down to that septum thing.

01:08:58.710 --> 01:09:02.100
In some manner, the septum
inhibits aggression.

01:09:02.100 --> 01:09:04.760
In the same way that,
simplistically, the amygdala

01:09:04.760 --> 01:09:07.590
mediates it, the exact
same sort of evidence,

01:09:07.590 --> 01:09:10.960
lesion studies, stimulation
studies, recording studies.

01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:13.100
For reasons I don't
fully understand,

01:09:13.100 --> 01:09:15.460
the septum has never
been really a hot spot

01:09:15.460 --> 01:09:16.790
for a lot of research.

01:09:16.790 --> 01:09:19.680
Nonetheless, it, in some
ways, works in opposition

01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:20.920
to the amygdala.

01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:23.410
You could now sit with
one of those circuit

01:09:23.410 --> 01:09:26.800
diagrams of the limbic system
seeing who's connecting to who.

01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:29.060
And you could see
what sort of wiring

01:09:29.060 --> 01:09:31.090
there must be for
the septum to try

01:09:31.090 --> 01:09:35.080
to silence the amygdala, what
the circuitry there would be.

01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:37.810
Back to that limbic rule,
all these limbic structures

01:09:37.810 --> 01:09:39.910
are trying to yell
at the hypothalamus

01:09:39.910 --> 01:09:43.630
and get it to listen to them
and not to the other regions.

01:09:43.630 --> 01:09:45.950
Another area implicated
in aggression--

01:09:45.950 --> 01:09:50.450
the lateral
hypothalamus, subject

01:09:50.450 --> 01:09:53.220
of a huge amount of research
in the 1960s, people

01:09:53.220 --> 01:09:54.470
interested in aggression.

01:09:54.470 --> 01:09:56.984
And then people acted
like ethologists

01:09:56.984 --> 01:09:58.650
and learned the thing
that we've already

01:09:58.650 --> 01:10:02.160
talked about a bit in here,
which is, oh, actually

01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:04.980
the lateral hypothalamus has
nothing to do with aggression.

01:10:04.980 --> 01:10:07.070
It's got to do with
predatory behavior.

01:10:07.070 --> 01:10:10.090
When a rat leaps on a
mouse and shreds it,

01:10:10.090 --> 01:10:11.570
that's not an act of aggression.

01:10:11.570 --> 01:10:13.380
That's an act of foraging.

01:10:13.380 --> 01:10:18.680
Oh, lateral hypothalamus, food
acquisition, not aggression.

01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:21.700
Tons of research in the
'60s went down the tubes

01:10:21.700 --> 01:10:24.600
when people began
to figure that out.

01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:27.670
Now flipping to the other
side of all of this stuff

01:10:27.670 --> 01:10:30.800
rather than the aggression
realm, the empathy realm,

01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:33.870
the compassionate realm-- where
are the structures coming in?

01:10:33.870 --> 01:10:36.450
And we already know
one area from the sex

01:10:36.450 --> 01:10:38.130
lectures that is
pertinent, which

01:10:38.130 --> 01:10:41.230
is the anterior
cingulate, sitting just

01:10:41.230 --> 01:10:42.970
behind the frontal cortex.

01:10:42.970 --> 01:10:45.550
And we already know about some
of the things that it does.

01:10:45.550 --> 01:10:47.540
Remember, that's the
part of the brain,

01:10:47.540 --> 01:10:51.600
somebody pokes your finger, it
activates, along with your pain

01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:53.060
receptor pathways.

01:10:53.060 --> 01:10:56.090
You watch the finger of your
loved on gets poked with a pin,

01:10:56.090 --> 01:10:58.910
anterior cingulate
activates as well.

01:10:58.910 --> 01:11:02.120
That is the part of the brain
where, literally and not just

01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:06.490
metaphorically, you feel the
pain of other individuals.

01:11:06.490 --> 01:11:07.670
How is this?

01:11:07.670 --> 01:11:10.400
Now, a study-- this was done
recently by a guy at Harvard

01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:11.420
named Josh Green.

01:11:11.420 --> 01:11:14.770
What he does is he puts people
in brain scanners, functional

01:11:14.770 --> 01:11:15.470
MRIs.

01:11:15.470 --> 01:11:18.890
And he gives them one of
the great, horrifying moral

01:11:18.890 --> 01:11:21.270
decisions that ever
sort of actually

01:11:21.270 --> 01:11:24.660
occurred in history, which
was the old scenario that

01:11:24.660 --> 01:11:28.140
and a bunch of people are hiding
from the Nazis who are nearby.

01:11:28.140 --> 01:11:30.020
And there is a baby with you.

01:11:30.020 --> 01:11:31.760
And the baby who keeps crying.

01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:33.370
And it is clear
if the baby keeps

01:11:33.370 --> 01:11:35.880
crying you are all going
to be caught and killed.

01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:38.110
Is it OK to smother the child?

01:11:38.110 --> 01:11:40.370
And this wonderfully
hypothetical,

01:11:40.370 --> 01:11:42.590
let's write a doctoral
thesis dissertation

01:11:42.590 --> 01:11:44.620
on this problem
here, was one which

01:11:44.620 --> 01:11:46.810
was a human sort
of decision that

01:11:46.810 --> 01:11:48.900
had to be made endless
number of times.

01:11:48.900 --> 01:11:51.240
What would you do in
that circumstance?

01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:53.260
And what he shows
in these studies

01:11:53.260 --> 01:11:57.610
are that people who activate
the anterior cingulate less

01:11:57.610 --> 01:11:59.930
when they are
contemplating this decision

01:11:59.930 --> 01:12:02.380
are more likely to reach
the decision that it

01:12:02.380 --> 01:12:04.740
is OK to smother the child.

01:12:04.740 --> 01:12:08.730
You see that in these studies,
something about the feeling

01:12:08.730 --> 01:12:11.970
the pain element,
the empathizing,

01:12:11.970 --> 01:12:14.920
something about that,
when it is not as extreme,

01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:17.810
that it is a predictor in these
studies of the individuals

01:12:17.810 --> 01:12:20.030
who will vote for
the smothering.

01:12:20.030 --> 01:12:22.740
All of this has given
rise to this view

01:12:22.740 --> 01:12:25.970
that a lot of what's
happening between the cortex

01:12:25.970 --> 01:12:28.970
and the limbic system is a
whole lot more complicated

01:12:28.970 --> 01:12:32.807
than this old dichotomy
between thought and emotion.

01:12:32.807 --> 01:12:34.140
And the cortex is about thought.

01:12:34.140 --> 01:12:35.910
And the limbic system
is about emotion.

01:12:35.910 --> 01:12:39.000
What is clear is, instead,
they are inseparable.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:40.900
This whole notion
brought up already,

01:12:40.900 --> 01:12:44.400
that Guy Damasio, major figure
in the field, this book of his

01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:46.200
called Descartes'
Error, where he

01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:50.310
goes over Descartes' notion
of the separability of thought

01:12:50.310 --> 01:12:52.720
and emotion, and how in
terms of brain function

01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:54.770
that is not remotely the case.

01:12:54.770 --> 01:12:57.290
In some realms,
you can partially

01:12:57.290 --> 01:13:01.780
separate frontal cortical
function from limbic function.

01:13:01.780 --> 01:13:04.780
One example of this-- and
this was a classic study done

01:13:04.780 --> 01:13:06.397
by that same guy, Josh Green.

01:13:06.397 --> 01:13:08.480
And this was when he was
still a graduate student.

01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:11.430
It involved making use of
people with a brain scanner

01:13:11.430 --> 01:13:13.950
with what's apparently
a classic test

01:13:13.950 --> 01:13:16.140
in, or a classic
puzzle in, philosophy--

01:13:16.140 --> 01:13:18.620
the runaway trolley problem.

01:13:18.620 --> 01:13:20.220
Here's the scenario.

01:13:20.220 --> 01:13:22.110
There is a trolley
which is somehow

01:13:22.110 --> 01:13:23.650
broken loose from its brake.

01:13:23.650 --> 01:13:25.490
It is rolling down
the tracks, where

01:13:25.490 --> 01:13:29.180
it is going to roll over
there and kill five people.

01:13:29.180 --> 01:13:31.560
First scenario,
you have a choice.

01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:34.880
You can pull a lever, which
will cause the trolley

01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:36.960
to be diverted onto a
different track, where

01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:38.710
it will kill one person.

01:13:38.710 --> 01:13:42.540
Is it OK to pull the lever,
saving these five people,

01:13:42.540 --> 01:13:44.530
and one person getting killed?

01:13:44.530 --> 01:13:47.160
Second scenario, you
have the option--

01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:49.590
you're standing behind
this big beefy person.

01:13:49.590 --> 01:13:52.580
And you can push him onto the
track, where the trolley will

01:13:52.580 --> 01:13:53.810
hit them and kill them.

01:13:53.810 --> 01:13:57.350
But it will stop it from
hitting the five people.

01:13:57.350 --> 01:14:01.200
Are you willing to kill one
person in order to save five?

01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:03.860
And something that is shown
in these studies over and over

01:14:03.860 --> 01:14:08.080
is 75% of people are
willing to pull the lever.

01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:11.640
25% of people or so or
willing with their own hands

01:14:11.640 --> 01:14:13.560
to push somebody onto the track.

01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:16.410
The math, the logic,
is absolutely equal.

01:14:16.410 --> 01:14:18.860
But this is always
interpreted as how

01:14:18.860 --> 01:14:20.730
we make different
sorts of decisions

01:14:20.730 --> 01:14:23.700
when it is a much more
visceral, in your face,

01:14:23.700 --> 01:14:27.020
you are going to have to
push this person to his death

01:14:27.020 --> 01:14:28.870
with your own hands,
versus something

01:14:28.870 --> 01:14:31.850
as impersonal as
pulling a lever sitting

01:14:31.850 --> 01:14:35.200
in a cockpit in a military
base in Las Vegas,

01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:37.360
and killing people on the
other side of the globe.

01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:39.760
How salient, in your face is it?

01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:42.780
You get very
different responses.

01:14:42.780 --> 01:14:45.110
And what Green showed
in his study was,

01:14:45.110 --> 01:14:47.180
have people contemplating
whether or not

01:14:47.180 --> 01:14:50.450
to pull the lever, it's the
cortex that's activating--

01:14:50.450 --> 01:14:52.320
predominantly frontal cortex.

01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:55.420
Have people decide whether or
not to push with their hands,

01:14:55.420 --> 01:14:58.347
it's predominately
limbic activation.

01:14:58.347 --> 01:15:00.430
Another version of this--
this has been researched

01:15:00.430 --> 01:15:02.920
by a guy at Dartmouth named
Oliver Goodenough-- again,

01:15:02.920 --> 01:15:03.990
brain imaging.

01:15:03.990 --> 01:15:06.750
And he is both a neurobiologist
and also on the law

01:15:06.750 --> 01:15:08.040
school faculty there.

01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:09.720
And here's the sort
of study he does.

01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:11.780
You will see the
equivalency of it.

01:15:11.780 --> 01:15:13.060
Put people in a scanner.

01:15:13.060 --> 01:15:15.790
And they've been going
through a mock jury trial.

01:15:15.790 --> 01:15:18.020
And what they now
receive on the scanner

01:15:18.020 --> 01:15:20.690
are the judge's
orders to the jury

01:15:20.690 --> 01:15:22.560
before they go and deliberate.

01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:26.460
First version, the judge says,
remember what you are here for.

01:15:26.460 --> 01:15:27.636
You may have your feelings.

01:15:27.636 --> 01:15:30.260
You may have your feelings about
the person, and what they did,

01:15:30.260 --> 01:15:31.390
or what they didn't do.

01:15:31.390 --> 01:15:35.390
But at the end of the day, your
job as a juror now deliberating

01:15:35.390 --> 01:15:39.440
is simply to decide, was
this law violated or not?

01:15:39.440 --> 01:15:42.060
This is not for you to decide
if it's a good law or not.

01:15:42.060 --> 01:15:45.030
This is simply, was
this law broken?

01:15:45.030 --> 01:15:48.082
Second scenario, the judge
stands there and says, OK,

01:15:48.082 --> 01:15:49.540
as you go and
deliberate, remember,

01:15:49.540 --> 01:15:50.665
of course, what the law is.

01:15:50.665 --> 01:15:53.470
But, remember, at the end of the
day, what is this system about?

01:15:53.470 --> 01:15:56.410
It is about protecting the
weak from the powerful.

01:15:56.410 --> 01:15:59.060
And you are a decision
maker at this point-- two

01:15:59.060 --> 01:15:59.990
totally different.

01:15:59.990 --> 01:16:01.330
One is rule bound.

01:16:01.330 --> 01:16:02.690
On is empathy bound.

01:16:02.690 --> 01:16:06.040
People get the first sets of
rules, cortex is activating.

01:16:06.040 --> 01:16:09.040
Second set of rules, limbic
system is activating.

01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:11.160
So those are some domains
where, in fact, they

01:16:11.160 --> 01:16:13.170
are quite separable.

01:16:13.170 --> 01:16:15.490
What you see,
though, is that there

01:16:15.490 --> 01:16:18.490
are all sorts of domains
in which it is a completely

01:16:18.490 --> 01:16:21.650
ridiculous dichotomy
to make between, oh,

01:16:21.650 --> 01:16:25.280
pure abstract cognitive
decisions, and these messy,

01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:28.100
yucky, emotive limbic
sorts of ones--

01:16:28.100 --> 01:16:31.820
instead, tremendous amounts of
interactions between the two.

01:16:31.820 --> 01:16:34.450
One domain where
you see this, which

01:16:34.450 --> 01:16:37.390
is what happens when
you begin to damage

01:16:37.390 --> 01:16:38.510
some of these structures?

01:16:38.510 --> 01:16:41.860
You change the flavor of
the decisions that are made.

01:16:41.860 --> 01:16:44.110
Get people with frontal damage.

01:16:44.110 --> 01:16:46.880
And give them the
runaway trolley problem.

01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:49.330
And they are far more
likely to say, yes,

01:16:49.330 --> 01:16:52.570
it is OK to push
somebody onto the tracks.

01:16:52.570 --> 01:16:56.200
They get a far more
utilitarian decision.

01:16:56.200 --> 01:16:58.770
Equally interesting, and
the same sort of punch line,

01:16:58.770 --> 01:17:01.240
studies where a technique
that's now just being worked out

01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:03.340
called transmagnetic
stimulation,

01:17:03.340 --> 01:17:06.140
were you can
decrease the activity

01:17:06.140 --> 01:17:09.520
of certain cortical regions for
a couple of minutes at a time.

01:17:09.520 --> 01:17:13.260
Turn off one sub region of
the frontal cortex in people,

01:17:13.260 --> 01:17:14.250
in volunteers.

01:17:14.250 --> 01:17:16.890
And in various game theory
games that they're doing,

01:17:16.890 --> 01:17:19.500
they become a lot
more utilitarian.

01:17:19.500 --> 01:17:21.620
They become a lot more selfish.

01:17:21.620 --> 01:17:24.920
So modulating interactions
between there,

01:17:24.920 --> 01:17:27.070
cross talk between the two.

01:17:27.070 --> 01:17:29.530
In some ways the most
interesting demonstration

01:17:29.530 --> 01:17:32.040
for me of the ways in which
these are not separable,

01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:34.580
this thought from
emotion stuff, is

01:17:34.580 --> 01:17:36.790
this really interesting
domain of how

01:17:36.790 --> 01:17:39.360
the human brain does metaphor.

01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:41.350
OK, so we get to symbols.

01:17:41.350 --> 01:17:42.920
We get to abstract things.

01:17:42.920 --> 01:17:46.310
We get into a world where
we have a legal system

01:17:46.310 --> 01:17:49.080
where not only can we judge
that somebody has done something

01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:51.960
wrong to somebody else, if they
have murdered them, or stolen

01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:53.000
their possessions.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.930
But they can be viewed as having
done something transgressive

01:17:55.930 --> 01:17:59.120
if they've ruined the
reputation of somebody else,

01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:02.980
if they've stolen the ideas
of somebody else, plagiarism.

01:18:02.980 --> 01:18:06.200
This is a very abstract
world of judgments we have.

01:18:06.200 --> 01:18:08.850
These are very symbolic
realms of decision

01:18:08.850 --> 01:18:10.890
making we are often into.

01:18:10.890 --> 01:18:13.330
Yet, we have this
problem that we

01:18:13.330 --> 01:18:17.520
have this very old evolutionary
brain that did not necessarily

01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:20.430
evolve for doing
symbols and metaphors.

01:18:20.430 --> 01:18:22.190
And one of the things
you wind of seeing

01:18:22.190 --> 01:18:25.080
is when the brain
evolved the ability

01:18:25.080 --> 01:18:27.620
to do some of this more
metaphorical stuff,

01:18:27.620 --> 01:18:31.050
it had to make use of the
old circuitry that was there.

01:18:31.050 --> 01:18:32.980
And, thus, what
you wind up seeing

01:18:32.980 --> 01:18:37.350
is very often when dealing
with extremely abstract issues

01:18:37.350 --> 01:18:39.550
of decision making,
we treat some

01:18:39.550 --> 01:18:41.610
of the metaphorical
components as

01:18:41.610 --> 01:18:43.870
if they were absolutely real.

01:18:43.870 --> 01:18:45.720
What would be an
example of this?

01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:50.000
Here's one very cool study
that was done recently.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:53.170
So your body and your
brain is very wired

01:18:53.170 --> 01:18:55.700
up for doing
temperature regulation.

01:18:55.700 --> 01:18:56.730
Oh, this is hot.

01:18:56.730 --> 01:18:57.660
This is cold.

01:18:57.660 --> 01:18:59.070
These are different
temperatures.

01:18:59.070 --> 01:19:02.330
There's a whole metric,
in temperature-sensitive

01:19:02.330 --> 01:19:03.340
receptors.

01:19:03.340 --> 01:19:05.330
And there's a whole
circuitry thing.

01:19:05.330 --> 01:19:08.080
And it's going about
the very physical task

01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:10.530
in the very real world
of telling something

01:19:10.530 --> 01:19:13.970
about temperature oscillation
of ions, or whatever.

01:19:13.970 --> 01:19:15.550
Get a hold of this study.

01:19:15.550 --> 01:19:17.060
Somebody is coming
up through what

01:19:17.060 --> 01:19:18.940
they believe is some
sort of psych testing

01:19:18.940 --> 01:19:20.510
that they have volunteered for.

01:19:20.510 --> 01:19:22.670
They get in the
elevator to go up.

01:19:22.670 --> 01:19:25.560
And the actual experiment
has started in the elevator.

01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:27.689
Somebody working on the
experiment comes in.

01:19:27.689 --> 01:19:29.480
And they're holding a
whole bunch of books,

01:19:29.480 --> 01:19:30.710
and barely holding on to them.

01:19:30.710 --> 01:19:32.270
And they're having
a cup of something.

01:19:32.270 --> 01:19:34.200
And they ask the person,
can you do me a favor?

01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:35.158
I'm about to drop this.

01:19:35.158 --> 01:19:37.070
Could you just hold
this cup until we get up

01:19:37.070 --> 01:19:38.310
to the fourth floor?

01:19:38.310 --> 01:19:41.100
In one case, the
cup is iced tea.

01:19:41.100 --> 01:19:42.750
The cup is cold.

01:19:42.750 --> 01:19:46.740
In the other case, the
cup is warm tea, warm.

01:19:46.740 --> 01:19:48.720
So the person spends
about 15 seconds

01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:51.489
holding either this cold
cup or this hot cup.

01:19:51.489 --> 01:19:53.030
And the person thanks
them afterward.

01:19:53.030 --> 01:19:54.200
And out they go.

01:19:54.200 --> 01:19:56.090
And then they are
asked to evaluate

01:19:56.090 --> 01:19:58.440
the personality of the
person they just interacted

01:19:58.440 --> 01:19:59.560
with in the elevator.

01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:02.430
And hold the warm cup,
and you rate the person

01:20:02.430 --> 01:20:07.220
as having a warmer, more
expressive personality.

01:20:07.220 --> 01:20:09.920
No, no, no, temperature
we're talking about,

01:20:09.920 --> 01:20:12.180
like how fast molecules
are oscillating.

01:20:12.180 --> 01:20:13.830
That's what temperature is.

01:20:13.830 --> 01:20:15.870
Warmth, that's just a metaphor.

01:20:15.870 --> 01:20:17.230
They get intermixed.

01:20:17.230 --> 01:20:19.690
When brains had to invent
dealing with things

01:20:19.690 --> 01:20:23.130
like how warm of a
personality somebody has,

01:20:23.130 --> 01:20:25.330
or even something
as nutty as how warm

01:20:25.330 --> 01:20:27.840
is the color of the
carpeting in this room,

01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:29.540
where are you going to stuff it?

01:20:29.540 --> 01:20:31.930
In some way, it
is hijacking some

01:20:31.930 --> 01:20:34.980
of the far more literal
pathways of storage

01:20:34.980 --> 01:20:36.770
of information in the brain.

01:20:36.770 --> 01:20:39.530
Another example-- here
is a wonderful one.

01:20:39.530 --> 01:20:42.530
We already know that the same
part of the brain, the anterior

01:20:42.530 --> 01:20:45.000
cingulate that will tell
you that your finger was

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:48.390
just poked, is telling you
that somebody else's finger was

01:20:48.390 --> 01:20:48.890
poked.

01:20:48.890 --> 01:20:52.570
You are feeling their pain in
the same part of the brain that

01:20:52.570 --> 01:20:54.990
is doing pain in the
literal sort of way,

01:20:54.990 --> 01:20:58.140
another case of the brain
kind of mixing metaphor

01:20:58.140 --> 01:21:00.120
and symbol with the real thing.

01:21:00.120 --> 01:21:02.850
Here's a particularly
interesting version.

01:21:02.850 --> 01:21:06.620
Go get yourself exposed
to some totally rotting,

01:21:06.620 --> 01:21:09.700
smelly carcass, or
inadvertently take a bite

01:21:09.700 --> 01:21:12.300
into some truly rotten food.

01:21:12.300 --> 01:21:14.890
And you will have an area
of the brain activate called

01:21:14.890 --> 01:21:17.310
the insular cortex.

01:21:17.310 --> 01:21:19.560
And what that does in
every species looked at

01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:24.770
is it processes foul,
disgusting stimuli-- disgusting

01:21:24.770 --> 01:21:27.580
spoiled food, or rotten,
smell all of that.

01:21:27.580 --> 01:21:29.970
That's what the
insular cortex does.

01:21:29.970 --> 01:21:34.190
And, no doubt, there's
tongue receptors telling you

01:21:34.190 --> 01:21:37.220
bacterial loads, or acidity
of this rotten food,

01:21:37.220 --> 01:21:38.420
or some such thing.

01:21:38.420 --> 01:21:40.860
And that's what this
part of the brain does.

01:21:40.860 --> 01:21:42.930
Now, sit down a person.

01:21:42.930 --> 01:21:46.490
And tell them a story of
somebody being totally, totally

01:21:46.490 --> 01:21:51.040
mistreated by somebody powerful,
and some completely exploited

01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:52.480
of horrible circumstance.

01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:55.960
And the insular
cortex will activate.

01:21:55.960 --> 01:21:58.640
Have somebody play some
game with somebody else,

01:21:58.640 --> 01:22:00.560
one of the prisoner's
dilemma type games,

01:22:00.560 --> 01:22:02.851
where the person
totally stabs him

01:22:02.851 --> 01:22:04.850
in the back, the person
they're playing against.

01:22:04.850 --> 01:22:08.280
And gets away with it, and
make a really exploitative,

01:22:08.280 --> 01:22:09.400
rotten gesture.

01:22:09.400 --> 01:22:12.580
And the insular
cortex activates.

01:22:12.580 --> 01:22:15.780
Sit somebody down and
say in the control group,

01:22:15.780 --> 01:22:17.370
tell me about some
event that happened

01:22:17.370 --> 01:22:18.520
when you were growing up.

01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:21.570
Versus the experimental
group, tell me about a time

01:22:21.570 --> 01:22:24.690
when you were growing up that
you did something really awful

01:22:24.690 --> 01:22:26.050
to somebody else.

01:22:26.050 --> 01:22:28.190
And the person describes
that circumstance.

01:22:28.190 --> 01:22:31.160
And the insular
cortex activates.

01:22:31.160 --> 01:22:33.680
What does this part
of the brain do?

01:22:33.680 --> 01:22:36.390
It's saying, oh, yes, this
food is full of maggots

01:22:36.390 --> 01:22:37.940
and does not taste very well.

01:22:37.940 --> 01:22:41.240
But it also does moral disgust.

01:22:41.240 --> 01:22:44.490
When you are feeling
disgusted with how someone

01:22:44.490 --> 01:22:48.190
has been treated, when how you
have been treated it activates.

01:22:48.190 --> 01:22:51.460
When you are having
moral self-disgust

01:22:51.460 --> 01:22:54.000
recounting something
awful you did to somebody,

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:55.870
this part of the
brain activates.

01:22:55.870 --> 01:22:59.270
My God, don't they realize
up there this is a metaphor?

01:22:59.270 --> 01:23:01.230
You're not really
eating rotten food.

01:23:01.230 --> 01:23:05.080
And every language on
Earth has words referring

01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:07.850
to moral failures
with words denoting

01:23:07.850 --> 01:23:10.780
gustatory, repellent stimuli.

01:23:10.780 --> 01:23:13.200
I am disgusted by what you did.

01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:15.440
The fact that they did
this, when I hear about what

01:23:15.440 --> 01:23:17.200
they did, it makes me nauseous.

01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:19.460
Something about
this smells rotten.

01:23:19.460 --> 01:23:22.430
Every culture has
terms that intermixes

01:23:22.430 --> 01:23:25.880
literal sensory disgust
with moral disgust.

01:23:25.880 --> 01:23:28.810
And what that's telling you
is that when humans came up

01:23:28.810 --> 01:23:31.490
with something as fancy
as moral transgressions,

01:23:31.490 --> 01:23:33.550
where are you going to
stick the sense of outrage

01:23:33.550 --> 01:23:35.425
you feel when there is
a moral transgression?

01:23:35.425 --> 01:23:36.930
I know.

01:23:36.930 --> 01:23:38.730
Let's hijack the part
of the brain that

01:23:38.730 --> 01:23:41.110
tells you you're eating
some rotten food,

01:23:41.110 --> 01:23:43.410
shoehorning into there.

01:23:43.410 --> 01:23:46.430
Now what you see is
it is possible for us

01:23:46.430 --> 01:23:50.090
to begin to confuse on which
level those areas are working.

01:23:50.090 --> 01:23:52.500
Another study, amazing
one a couple of years

01:23:52.500 --> 01:23:54.420
ago-- here's what was
done in the study.

01:23:54.420 --> 01:23:56.030
You take people.

01:23:56.030 --> 01:23:58.030
And you put them
through their paces

01:23:58.030 --> 01:23:59.807
of either telling me
something wonderful

01:23:59.807 --> 01:24:01.390
you did when you
were a kid, something

01:24:01.390 --> 01:24:05.010
neutral, or some moral
transgression you once had.

01:24:05.010 --> 01:24:06.060
Tell me all about it.

01:24:06.060 --> 01:24:08.010
And then afterward,
saying, well,

01:24:08.010 --> 01:24:09.975
thanks for
participating in this.

01:24:09.975 --> 01:24:11.640
And tell you what?

01:24:11.640 --> 01:24:13.240
We can't pay you.

01:24:13.240 --> 01:24:15.930
But we can either
give you this pen set.

01:24:15.930 --> 01:24:18.640
Or we can give you
this nice flash drive.

01:24:18.640 --> 01:24:23.110
Or we can give you this little
soap set of scented soaps,

01:24:23.110 --> 01:24:23.760
or whatever.

01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:27.020
And have people talk about
their moral failings,

01:24:27.020 --> 01:24:30.450
and they're more likely to
choose the soap afterward.

01:24:30.450 --> 01:24:34.340
People want to wash their
hands of their sins.

01:24:34.340 --> 01:24:38.290
And starting with [? pilot ?]
washing his hands of whatever,

01:24:38.290 --> 01:24:42.570
this is in intermixing of
metaphor with reality, showing

01:24:42.570 --> 01:24:44.240
how clearly this was the case.

01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:47.740
Now what they next did in the
study was have people wallow

01:24:47.740 --> 01:24:50.710
in recounting something awful
they had done to somebody else.

01:24:50.710 --> 01:24:53.112
And then they were allowed
to go to the bathroom.

01:24:53.112 --> 01:24:54.570
And I don't quite
remember how they

01:24:54.570 --> 01:24:57.028
did this, if they had cameras
in the bathroom, which I kind

01:24:57.028 --> 01:24:59.980
of suspect they didn't, or if
they weighed the soap afterward

01:24:59.980 --> 01:25:00.550
or something.

01:25:00.550 --> 01:25:03.340
But people who had just gone
through the moral transgression

01:25:03.340 --> 01:25:05.590
recounting were much more
likely to go in the bathroom

01:25:05.590 --> 01:25:07.480
and washed their
hands at that point.

01:25:07.480 --> 01:25:09.310
But now what they
had were people

01:25:09.310 --> 01:25:12.010
who had done the moral
transgression recounting.

01:25:12.010 --> 01:25:14.260
Either they were
given the opportunity

01:25:14.260 --> 01:25:16.910
to wash their hands
afterward of it.

01:25:16.910 --> 01:25:19.920
Or they were not
given the opportunity.

01:25:19.920 --> 01:25:22.780
Now sitting in the
test room, what happens

01:25:22.780 --> 01:25:23.940
is the staged thing.

01:25:23.940 --> 01:25:26.340
One of the people
working on the project

01:25:26.340 --> 01:25:28.550
comes in holding a
whole bunch of books,

01:25:28.550 --> 01:25:30.960
and accidentally drops them.

01:25:30.960 --> 01:25:34.070
And a bunch of pencils
scattered all over the floor.

01:25:34.070 --> 01:25:38.810
If you were allowed to wash your
hands of your metaphorical sins

01:25:38.810 --> 01:25:41.420
in the previous few minutes,
what they showed was

01:25:41.420 --> 01:25:45.750
you were less likely to
jump up and help the person.

01:25:45.750 --> 01:25:48.270
People translating
a sense of being

01:25:48.270 --> 01:25:52.960
morally soiled into being an
imperative of helping somebody

01:25:52.960 --> 01:25:53.550
else.

01:25:53.550 --> 01:25:57.080
Let somebody go wash their hands
of recounting the awful thing

01:25:57.080 --> 01:25:58.820
they did to somebody
else, and they're

01:25:58.820 --> 01:26:01.330
less likely to help
people afterward.

01:26:01.330 --> 01:26:03.280
What I think we're
seeing here is

01:26:03.280 --> 01:26:07.690
this amazing intertwining
of doing some of our most

01:26:07.690 --> 01:26:11.480
abstract judgments, and
decision making, and decisions

01:26:11.480 --> 01:26:14.520
about behaviors or not
where we just got these old,

01:26:14.520 --> 01:26:18.360
ancient, mammalian brains
that those rotten food,

01:26:18.360 --> 01:26:20.150
doesn't do rotten ethics.

01:26:20.150 --> 01:26:22.020
You've got the systems confused.

01:26:22.020 --> 01:26:25.850
What this begins to speak to is
work by very prominent person

01:26:25.850 --> 01:26:28.790
in the field, a guy University
of Virginia Jonathan Haight,

01:26:28.790 --> 01:26:33.360
whose work emphasizes just how
much moral decision making is

01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:37.420
not decision making, how much
it is affective decisions,

01:26:37.420 --> 01:26:41.600
showing first with brain imaging
how often you are getting

01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:46.030
the affective, the limbic,
the disgusted cortical levels

01:26:46.030 --> 01:26:49.310
of response before you
have the decision making.

01:26:49.310 --> 01:26:52.670
Argument being,
there it is affect

01:26:52.670 --> 01:26:55.170
driving the decision making,
rather than the other way

01:26:55.170 --> 01:26:55.850
around.

01:26:55.850 --> 01:26:58.400
But what he also points
out is the frequency

01:26:58.400 --> 01:27:00.270
you give people
scenarios-- and he's

01:27:00.270 --> 01:27:02.320
doing really interesting
work with this-- where

01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:06.190
you give somebody a
scenario where it just

01:27:06.190 --> 01:27:07.580
strikes you as wrong.

01:27:07.580 --> 01:27:10.120
Here are three of
the ones that he

01:27:10.120 --> 01:27:11.720
uses very often in the studies.

01:27:11.720 --> 01:27:15.040
First one, you describe
a pair of siblings.

01:27:15.040 --> 01:27:16.520
They are grown up.

01:27:16.520 --> 01:27:18.539
They are post-reproductive.

01:27:18.539 --> 01:27:19.830
She has gone through menopause.

01:27:19.830 --> 01:27:21.390
He's had a vasectomy, whatever.

01:27:21.390 --> 01:27:25.000
And they are in love, and not
in the platonic sibling way.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:28.260
And they want to have a sexual
incestuous relationship.

01:27:28.260 --> 01:27:31.540
Is it OK for them to do
it completely in private?

01:27:31.540 --> 01:27:34.480
Second scenario-- your
elderly grandmother

01:27:34.480 --> 01:27:37.880
says it is absolutely fine with
her to slap her in the face

01:27:37.880 --> 01:27:38.650
right now.

01:27:38.650 --> 01:27:41.970
Do you feel like it is OK to do?

01:27:41.970 --> 01:27:44.510
Third scenario, one
that he brings up

01:27:44.510 --> 01:27:47.620
having to do with burning
a flag and stomping on it,

01:27:47.620 --> 01:27:50.380
something laden with symbolism,
but at the end of the day

01:27:50.380 --> 01:27:52.800
is nothing more than
just some cloth.

01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:55.330
Another one he brings
up is, you're hungry.

01:27:55.330 --> 01:27:56.840
Your pet has just died.

01:27:56.840 --> 01:27:59.150
Why not cut him up and eat him?

01:27:59.150 --> 01:28:02.900
And in all these cases, what you
have is exactly the responses

01:28:02.900 --> 01:28:04.260
all of you just had in there.

01:28:04.260 --> 01:28:06.350
And these insular,
cortical neurons

01:28:06.350 --> 01:28:08.910
are popping out of people's
ears all over this room.

01:28:08.910 --> 01:28:13.420
And then what he does is say,
well, what's wrong with that?

01:28:13.420 --> 01:28:16.020
And people really
have a hard time

01:28:16.020 --> 01:28:19.770
giving a rational explanation,
this whole framework

01:28:19.770 --> 01:28:22.670
that he has developed, which
most of the imaging research

01:28:22.670 --> 01:28:26.320
agrees with, that people make
their affective decisions long

01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:28.190
before their more
cognitive ones.

01:28:28.190 --> 01:28:31.480
The cognitive ones are catching
up afterward trying to figure

01:28:31.480 --> 01:28:35.400
out, well, why is it so
important that you cannot step

01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:38.090
on some cloth that has
this pattern on it?

01:28:38.090 --> 01:28:40.760
But it's OK to step on
the cloth with-- why

01:28:40.760 --> 01:28:43.900
is that something worth
putting people in jail for?

01:28:43.900 --> 01:28:46.070
It just doesn't feel right.

01:28:46.070 --> 01:28:47.570
And I think what
that has much to do

01:28:47.570 --> 01:28:51.460
with is how much of the
coding of the abstract stuff

01:28:51.460 --> 01:28:54.910
has to be stuffed into ancient
brain pathways that's telling

01:28:54.910 --> 01:28:57.670
you about very cold
things, instead

01:28:57.670 --> 01:29:00.750
of cold personalities,
very disgusting foods

01:29:00.750 --> 01:29:02.760
rather than
disgusting moral acts.

01:29:02.760 --> 01:29:05.880
We are dealing with a very
ancient brain, and one that's

01:29:05.880 --> 01:29:09.460
not very good yet at
separating the limbic world

01:29:09.460 --> 01:29:11.760
from a more cortical one.

01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:14.980
OK, couple more pieces
of this-- final piece

01:29:14.980 --> 01:29:18.840
in terms of making sense of the
neurobiology, which is now you

01:29:18.840 --> 01:29:21.500
look at parts of the
brain when somebody is

01:29:21.500 --> 01:29:22.980
committing an aggressive act.

01:29:22.980 --> 01:29:26.840
And you show neurons
get activated there.

01:29:26.840 --> 01:29:28.230
Well, that's kind
of interesting,

01:29:28.230 --> 01:29:32.740
all sorts of hypothalamus
nuclei, mid-brain, brain stem,

01:29:32.740 --> 01:29:35.910
those reptilian parts of the
brain from the other day.

01:29:35.910 --> 01:29:36.900
You see that happening.

01:29:36.900 --> 01:29:38.941
You say, well, someone
does something aggressive.

01:29:38.941 --> 01:29:40.190
And they activate.

01:29:40.190 --> 01:29:41.580
That seems to be interesting.

01:29:41.580 --> 01:29:42.920
That seems to be pertinent.

01:29:42.920 --> 01:29:45.960
And it winds up being not
pertinent in the slightest,

01:29:45.960 --> 01:29:49.580
because what you see is those
are the same neurons that

01:29:49.580 --> 01:29:52.039
would activate if you are
running for your life.

01:29:52.039 --> 01:29:53.580
Those are the same
neurons that would

01:29:53.580 --> 01:29:56.750
activate if you were running
joyfully to meet someone.

01:29:56.750 --> 01:29:58.330
Those are neurons
that are just doing

01:29:58.330 --> 01:30:01.750
the nuts and bolts sympathetic
nervous system stuff.

01:30:01.750 --> 01:30:03.350
If you were running
for your life,

01:30:03.350 --> 01:30:05.350
or if you were running
towards someone

01:30:05.350 --> 01:30:08.510
you love, and those are totally
different emotional states,

01:30:08.510 --> 01:30:11.070
nonetheless your heart
has to be beating faster.

01:30:11.070 --> 01:30:13.640
And your diaphragm has to be
doing something different.

01:30:13.640 --> 01:30:17.510
These are nonspecific
pathways of activation

01:30:17.510 --> 01:30:19.170
in the sympathetic
nervous system.

01:30:19.170 --> 01:30:22.060
As has been stated, if you are
recording from some of these

01:30:22.060 --> 01:30:24.850
sympathetic nuclei
in the mid-brain,

01:30:24.850 --> 01:30:27.930
if you were recording from them,
you cannot tell the difference

01:30:27.930 --> 01:30:31.320
whether a person has just
murdered someone or just had

01:30:31.320 --> 01:30:32.520
an orgasm.

01:30:32.520 --> 01:30:34.410
In both of those
cases, neurons have

01:30:34.410 --> 01:30:36.420
to be doing very similar things.

01:30:36.420 --> 01:30:40.720
There's a whole realm of
non-specificity to arousal.

01:30:40.720 --> 01:30:43.330
And this brings up a
really important quote,

01:30:43.330 --> 01:30:46.290
and one that I think will run
through all of these aggression

01:30:46.290 --> 01:30:50.470
sections here, a quote
from Elie Wiesel,

01:30:50.470 --> 01:30:53.580
concentration camp survivor,
Nobel Laureate for his writing,

01:30:53.580 --> 01:30:55.930
Elie Wiesel,
extraordinary man, who

01:30:55.930 --> 01:30:59.150
has this famous quote,
which goes as follows.

01:30:59.150 --> 01:31:02.440
The opposite of
love is not hate.

01:31:02.440 --> 01:31:05.950
The opposite of love
is indifference.

01:31:05.950 --> 01:31:07.820
And the way that he
uses it is in sort

01:31:07.820 --> 01:31:09.426
of a historical framework.

01:31:09.426 --> 01:31:10.800
The opposite of
love is not hate.

01:31:10.800 --> 01:31:12.830
The greatest harm
you can do to someone

01:31:12.830 --> 01:31:14.450
who has been a
victim of something

01:31:14.450 --> 01:31:17.230
is to be indifferent
to their history,

01:31:17.230 --> 01:31:20.596
to deny that it has happened,
to see it not be an imperative

01:31:20.596 --> 01:31:22.720
to make sure it never
happens to anyone else again,

01:31:22.720 --> 01:31:23.880
et cetera, et cetera.

01:31:23.880 --> 01:31:26.470
The opposite of hate
is indifference.

01:31:26.470 --> 01:31:29.770
Applied to physiology here,
it is absolutely the case.

01:31:29.770 --> 01:31:32.240
When you look at what the
sympathetic nervous system is

01:31:32.240 --> 01:31:35.290
doing, when you look at
some of the stress hormones,

01:31:35.290 --> 01:31:37.750
love and hate are not
opposites in the slightest.

01:31:37.750 --> 01:31:40.330
They are physiologically
very, very similar.

01:31:40.330 --> 01:31:42.390
What I think that
also tells you is

01:31:42.390 --> 01:31:45.580
how readily some humans
psychopathologically

01:31:45.580 --> 01:31:47.380
can confuse the two states.

01:31:47.380 --> 01:31:48.960
When you look at
some of these brain

01:31:48.960 --> 01:31:52.160
stem hindbrain spinal
areas during these acts,

01:31:52.160 --> 01:31:53.820
love and hate are not opposites.

01:31:53.820 --> 01:31:56.270
They are very related
to each other.

01:31:56.270 --> 01:32:00.270
OK, jumping forward in the last
couple of minutes, what we now

01:32:00.270 --> 01:32:03.040
have is looking at
what hormones are doing

01:32:03.040 --> 01:32:05.830
to this-- hormones in terms
of the short-term hormonal

01:32:05.830 --> 01:32:09.000
environment, not early in
life, the short-term hormonal

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:09.700
environment.

01:32:09.700 --> 01:32:12.130
And what we have to deal
with, of course, instantly

01:32:12.130 --> 01:32:13.930
if we're going to
bring up hormones is,

01:32:13.930 --> 01:32:16.370
so what's the deal
with testosterone?

01:32:16.370 --> 01:32:19.340
What does testosterone
have to do with aggression?

01:32:19.340 --> 01:32:22.480
Why is it that in virtually
every species out there,

01:32:22.480 --> 01:32:25.490
males are more aggressive
than females, males have more

01:32:25.490 --> 01:32:27.140
testosterone than females do?

01:32:27.140 --> 01:32:29.720
All you need to do to make
sense of this whole section

01:32:29.720 --> 01:32:32.410
here is take everything
from last week concerning

01:32:32.410 --> 01:32:34.890
testosterone and sexual
behavior and just

01:32:34.890 --> 01:32:38.150
substitute aggressive
behavior for sexual behavior.

01:32:38.150 --> 01:32:39.980
It's the same exact rules.

01:32:39.980 --> 01:32:43.560
Yes, testosterone is required
for the full expression

01:32:43.560 --> 01:32:46.430
of aggressive behavior
in males of most species.

01:32:46.430 --> 01:32:47.470
How do you tell?

01:32:47.470 --> 01:32:50.160
Subtract it out, the
castration stuff.

01:32:50.160 --> 01:32:53.690
After castration, do levels
of aggression go down to zero?

01:32:53.690 --> 01:32:57.620
No, same thing as last
week, the more prior

01:32:57.620 --> 01:33:00.520
experience one has
being aggressive,

01:33:00.520 --> 01:33:02.260
the less of a drop
in aggression there

01:33:02.260 --> 01:33:05.290
is after testosterone
levels are removed.

01:33:05.290 --> 01:33:09.600
Put back 100% the normal levels,
aggression is reinstated.

01:33:09.600 --> 01:33:13.710
Put back 10% the normal levels,
reinstated to the same extent,

01:33:13.710 --> 01:33:18.070
200%, same extent, same
exact rule-- testosterone

01:33:18.070 --> 01:33:21.140
is needed for the normal
expression of behavior.

01:33:21.140 --> 01:33:24.490
But it is not necessary
or sufficient.

01:33:24.490 --> 01:33:26.600
And your brain,
your limbic system,

01:33:26.600 --> 01:33:28.730
can't tell the
difference between

01:33:28.730 --> 01:33:32.290
moderate, medium, and very
high levels of testosterone.

01:33:32.290 --> 01:33:34.840
There is no way you could
look at an individual's

01:33:34.840 --> 01:33:36.820
testosterone levels,
and because it's

01:33:36.820 --> 01:33:39.220
two units higher than
it was last week,

01:33:39.220 --> 01:33:41.640
or higher than the person
sitting next to them, to make

01:33:41.640 --> 01:33:45.260
any sort of prediction about who
is going to be more aggressive.

01:33:45.260 --> 01:33:47.990
When you see a correlation
between the levels

01:33:47.990 --> 01:33:50.660
of aggression and
levels of testosterone,

01:33:50.660 --> 01:33:54.400
it's the behavior driving the
testosterone, not the other way

01:33:54.400 --> 01:33:55.680
around.

01:33:55.680 --> 01:33:57.870
How does this translate
into physiology?

01:33:57.870 --> 01:34:01.190
Here's one example of
this in terms of studies.

01:34:01.190 --> 01:34:03.520
Take five rhesus monkey
males-- and this was

01:34:03.520 --> 01:34:05.120
a classic study that was done.

01:34:05.120 --> 01:34:07.780
Put them together, and they
form a dominance hierarchy.

01:34:07.780 --> 01:34:09.630
Number run beats
two through five,

01:34:09.630 --> 01:34:11.800
number two beats three
through five, so on.

01:34:11.800 --> 01:34:15.220
Take number three and pump
him up with testosterone.

01:34:15.220 --> 01:34:18.240
Pump him up with insane
amounts of testosterone.

01:34:18.240 --> 01:34:22.800
And what you will see is he will
now be involved in more fights.

01:34:22.800 --> 01:34:25.600
Does that mean that number
three is now threatening

01:34:25.600 --> 01:34:27.420
number two and number one?

01:34:27.420 --> 01:34:30.570
Absolutely not, what's
going on, number three

01:34:30.570 --> 01:34:34.280
is being a nightmare to
numbers four and five.

01:34:34.280 --> 01:34:37.270
Is testosterone
changing the structure

01:34:37.270 --> 01:34:38.780
of aggression in this group?

01:34:38.780 --> 01:34:43.670
No, it's exaggerating the
pre-existing social structure.

01:34:43.670 --> 01:34:46.360
What testosterone
does is modulate.

01:34:46.360 --> 01:34:47.660
It amplifies.

01:34:47.660 --> 01:34:51.510
It does not turn on a
radio of aggressive music.

01:34:51.510 --> 01:34:53.860
It increases the
volume if and only

01:34:53.860 --> 01:34:56.020
if it is already turned on.

01:34:56.020 --> 01:34:59.510
What does this look like
in terms of the biology,

01:34:59.510 --> 01:35:01.510
getting down to the
neurobiology level?

01:35:01.510 --> 01:35:04.620
That whole business,
raise testosterone levels,

01:35:04.620 --> 01:35:07.330
and the amygdala gets
a lower threshold

01:35:07.330 --> 01:35:09.840
for deciding that a
face looks threatening.

01:35:09.840 --> 01:35:12.520
Put somebody in a brain
scanner, and flashing up

01:35:12.520 --> 01:35:16.580
subliminal faces, and it takes
less of a scary face, one that

01:35:16.580 --> 01:35:19.790
would be border line higher
testosterone levels in someone,

01:35:19.790 --> 01:35:22.760
amygdala activates more.

01:35:22.760 --> 01:35:25.190
How would this look like
on a cellular level?

01:35:25.190 --> 01:35:26.720
Back, remember,
with that business

01:35:26.720 --> 01:35:29.880
about action potentials, the
neuron has an action potential.

01:35:29.880 --> 01:35:34.810
And then for a while afterward,
it enters a refractory period.

01:35:34.810 --> 01:35:37.170
It is silent for
a while afterward.

01:35:37.170 --> 01:35:40.450
What does testosterone do on
the level of single neurons

01:35:40.450 --> 01:35:41.610
in the amygdala?

01:35:41.610 --> 01:35:44.850
It shortens the
refractory period.

01:35:44.850 --> 01:35:46.840
It makes it possible
for the neurons

01:35:46.840 --> 01:35:50.000
to fire more times
per unit time,

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:51.840
thus asking the
question, what does

01:35:51.840 --> 01:35:55.170
testosterone do to
electrical activity

01:35:55.170 --> 01:35:56.710
in neurons and the amygdala?

01:35:56.710 --> 01:35:58.340
It does nothing.

01:35:58.340 --> 01:36:02.600
If and only if the neurons
are already excited,

01:36:02.600 --> 01:36:05.240
testosterone will increase
the numbers of them.

01:36:05.240 --> 01:36:07.370
Testosterone does not cause.

01:36:07.370 --> 01:36:08.600
It amplifies.

01:36:08.600 --> 01:36:13.880
And what it mostly amplifies is
preexisting social structures.

01:36:13.880 --> 01:36:16.000
OK, you noticed
there that I was also

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.617
being very careful in
saying on the average,

01:36:18.617 --> 01:36:21.200
males are more aggressive than
females in all sorts of species

01:36:21.200 --> 01:36:21.700
out there.

01:36:21.700 --> 01:36:24.480
On the average, males have
higher testosterone levels

01:36:24.480 --> 01:36:25.420
than females do.

01:36:25.420 --> 01:36:28.170
The one great exception
to this, which is briefly

01:36:28.170 --> 01:36:29.780
touched on in the
zebra book, which

01:36:29.780 --> 01:36:33.050
is one of the great topics
in all of endocrinology

01:36:33.050 --> 01:36:36.030
these days, is spotted hyenas.

01:36:36.030 --> 01:36:38.460
Hyenas are weird animals.

01:36:38.460 --> 01:36:42.000
Hyenas have a totally
different worldview thanks

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.020
to a bizarre neurobiology.

01:36:44.020 --> 01:36:48.670
Among spotted hyenas, females
are dominant to males.

01:36:48.670 --> 01:36:50.970
Females are bigger than males.

01:36:50.970 --> 01:36:53.590
Females are more
muscular than males.

01:36:53.590 --> 01:36:56.070
Females are more
aggressive than males.

01:36:56.070 --> 01:36:59.580
Females have higher testosterone
levels than males do.

01:36:59.580 --> 01:37:02.020
And you look at the
private parts of a hyena,

01:37:02.020 --> 01:37:04.490
and you cannot tell
who is which sex.

01:37:04.490 --> 01:37:08.050
Female hyenas have
androgenization.

01:37:08.050 --> 01:37:11.890
They have enlarged clitoris's
the size of penises in males.

01:37:11.890 --> 01:37:14.760
They have something that looks
like a scrotum, which turns out

01:37:14.760 --> 01:37:18.980
to be compacted fat cells that
form these scrotum-like things.

01:37:18.980 --> 01:37:21.310
And they look just
like the males.

01:37:21.310 --> 01:37:23.180
And over the years as
part of my field work,

01:37:23.180 --> 01:37:26.090
I spent some years sharing
camp with a guy who is without

01:37:26.090 --> 01:37:29.350
question the world's expert
on, like, hyena clitoris's.

01:37:29.350 --> 01:37:32.390
And this guy would bring
in some anesthetized hyena.

01:37:32.390 --> 01:37:34.780
And he would have to
look at this thing for 15

01:37:34.780 --> 01:37:37.785
minutes with like
calipers, and like night

01:37:37.785 --> 01:37:40.860
viewing goggles and stuff to
finally decide its gender.

01:37:40.860 --> 01:37:45.240
Hyenas are this very interesting
case of a sex reversal

01:37:45.240 --> 01:37:46.810
androgenization.

01:37:46.810 --> 01:37:48.880
Females producing
very high levels

01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:50.810
of androgens in their ovaries.

01:37:50.810 --> 01:37:53.070
And you've got this
sex reversal system

01:37:53.070 --> 01:37:57.040
with the following thing, unlike
in most species of carnivores.

01:37:57.040 --> 01:37:59.370
What happens in the
lions, for example,

01:37:59.370 --> 01:38:03.570
males eat first, followed by
females, followed by cubs.

01:38:03.570 --> 01:38:07.080
Most lion cubs starve to death
in the first year of life.

01:38:07.080 --> 01:38:10.610
Among hyenas because of
the sex reversal system,

01:38:10.610 --> 01:38:14.470
cubs eat first, followed by
females, followed by males.

01:38:14.470 --> 01:38:18.890
The kids survive that
way, a wonderful mutation

01:38:18.890 --> 01:38:20.040
in terms of doing that.

01:38:20.040 --> 01:38:22.910
And what you get as a
result is, unavoidably, you

01:38:22.910 --> 01:38:26.840
get a masculinization of the
genitalia in the females.

01:38:26.840 --> 01:38:29.840
And what you wind up doing
is it winds up having

01:38:29.840 --> 01:38:32.410
a different signaling purpose.

01:38:32.410 --> 01:38:35.260
In most species, what
happens among male primates,

01:38:35.260 --> 01:38:37.820
for example when
males are trying

01:38:37.820 --> 01:38:40.660
to display their dominance,
they get an erection

01:38:40.660 --> 01:38:44.090
and wave their penis, and
look how tough and scary I am.

01:38:44.090 --> 01:38:46.290
And that's due to
a certain wiring

01:38:46.290 --> 01:38:48.020
of the autonomic nervous system.

01:38:48.020 --> 01:38:51.380
In hyenas, it works
just the opposite.

01:38:51.380 --> 01:38:54.476
Males get erections
when they're terrified,

01:38:54.476 --> 01:38:55.600
because you think about it.

01:38:55.600 --> 01:38:57.150
Males are lower
ranking than females.

01:38:57.150 --> 01:38:59.530
Females spend all their
time ripping off the males

01:38:59.530 --> 01:39:00.890
who have just hunted something.

01:39:00.890 --> 01:39:02.650
Females terrorize the males.

01:39:02.650 --> 01:39:04.160
So you're some
male sitting there.

01:39:04.160 --> 01:39:06.320
And here comes this
terrifying female.

01:39:06.320 --> 01:39:06.990
What do you do?

01:39:06.990 --> 01:39:08.470
You say, don't hurt me.

01:39:08.470 --> 01:39:09.540
I'm one of these males.

01:39:09.540 --> 01:39:11.110
I'm not threatening,
or whatever.

01:39:11.110 --> 01:39:14.260
In males, what you get
is you get erections

01:39:14.260 --> 01:39:17.330
when you are under stress
as a subordination gesture.

01:39:17.330 --> 01:39:18.870
What do females do?

01:39:18.870 --> 01:39:22.010
Low ranking females
get clitoral erections

01:39:22.010 --> 01:39:24.520
when they are being threatened
by high ranking females,

01:39:24.520 --> 01:39:26.890
a total sex reversal system.

01:39:26.890 --> 01:39:29.920
So hyenas can either
wind up telling you,

01:39:29.920 --> 01:39:33.530
we are breaking out of
these stereotypical role

01:39:33.530 --> 01:39:35.980
gender expectations, in that
you can have a species where

01:39:35.980 --> 01:39:38.995
females are dominant, and more
muscular, and more aggressive.

01:39:38.995 --> 01:39:40.870
But at the end of the
day, they are like that

01:39:40.870 --> 01:39:43.440
because they are even
more hormonally like males

01:39:43.440 --> 01:39:45.270
than males are.

01:39:45.270 --> 01:39:47.580
Final amazing thing
about them-- and this

01:39:47.580 --> 01:39:49.600
is a story of this
friend of mine,

01:39:49.600 --> 01:39:52.366
this guy who's been studying
hyenas for 30 years.

01:39:52.366 --> 01:39:55.780
And he's incredibly
knowledgeable about hyenas.

01:39:55.780 --> 01:39:57.560
And this was
something that really

01:39:57.560 --> 01:39:59.960
makes you stunned at
what sort of people

01:39:59.960 --> 01:40:02.490
there are in the government
thinking about things here.

01:40:02.490 --> 01:40:04.110
So one day-- he's from Berkeley.

01:40:04.110 --> 01:40:05.750
One day, he's in
his office there.

01:40:05.750 --> 01:40:06.920
And he gets a call.

01:40:06.920 --> 01:40:09.650
And it's from some army colonel.

01:40:09.650 --> 01:40:12.869
And the army colonel says,
oh, we're having a conference.

01:40:12.869 --> 01:40:15.410
And we're having a whole bunch
of carnivore biologists coming

01:40:15.410 --> 01:40:15.576
to it.

01:40:15.576 --> 01:40:16.690
We're going to
have a great time.

01:40:16.690 --> 01:40:18.990
We're having this conference
of carnivore biologists.

01:40:18.990 --> 01:40:20.240
And we want you to come to it.

01:40:20.240 --> 01:40:23.155
My friend says, um,
you're from the army?

01:40:23.155 --> 01:40:24.280
What are you talking about?

01:40:24.280 --> 01:40:25.380
Do you know what I study?

01:40:25.380 --> 01:40:27.963
And the guy proceeds to show him
that he knows exactly what he

01:40:27.963 --> 01:40:30.140
studies, and what his
social security number is,

01:40:30.140 --> 01:40:33.390
and how many, like, cavities he
has, and how much unpaid taxes.

01:40:33.390 --> 01:40:35.906
And he says, so all of
America's carnivore biologists

01:40:35.906 --> 01:40:37.030
are coming to this meeting.

01:40:37.030 --> 01:40:37.890
So come to this meeting.

01:40:37.890 --> 01:40:39.070
We're going to
have a great time.

01:40:39.070 --> 01:40:40.850
It's going to be at
this hotel in Arizona.

01:40:40.850 --> 01:40:42.620
Come, you're going to
have a terrific guy.

01:40:42.620 --> 01:40:44.180
So my friend decides, why not?

01:40:44.180 --> 01:40:46.370
And goes to this, and
winds up in this place.

01:40:46.370 --> 01:40:48.010
And here's this
conference with all

01:40:48.010 --> 01:40:49.910
of America's
carnivore biologists,

01:40:49.910 --> 01:40:51.740
and these three army
colonels sitting

01:40:51.740 --> 01:40:53.850
in the back with
these sunglasses on.

01:40:53.850 --> 01:40:56.720
So all the carnivore biologists
are fairly confused about

01:40:56.720 --> 01:40:57.959
what's up here.

01:40:57.959 --> 01:40:59.750
But, nonetheless, they
sort of settle down.

01:40:59.750 --> 01:41:01.541
And they start doing
their scientist thing,

01:41:01.541 --> 01:41:03.240
giving talks to each other.

01:41:03.240 --> 01:41:06.400
And the Army guys are
sitting in the back there.

01:41:06.400 --> 01:41:08.590
And there's two days
worth of them just sitting

01:41:08.590 --> 01:41:09.730
in the back saying nothing.

01:41:09.730 --> 01:41:11.710
And, finally, all the
carnival biologists

01:41:11.710 --> 01:41:14.416
get all upset, and say, what
are you guys doing here?

01:41:14.416 --> 01:41:15.790
What are we doing
at a conference

01:41:15.790 --> 01:41:17.690
paid for by the US Military?

01:41:17.690 --> 01:41:19.987
And they finally say, OK,
OK, you're such great guys.

01:41:19.987 --> 01:41:22.570
We're going to tell you actually
what we're really up to here.

01:41:22.570 --> 01:41:23.986
You know, we're
from the military.

01:41:23.986 --> 01:41:25.850
We're actually from
the tank corps.

01:41:25.850 --> 01:41:30.130
And what we have is we're
designing these new walker

01:41:30.130 --> 01:41:30.630
things.

01:41:30.630 --> 01:41:33.252
Do you remember in the Star
Wars movie, in the second one,

01:41:33.252 --> 01:41:35.710
they had those machines that
looked like the elephants that

01:41:35.710 --> 01:41:36.834
could walk and all of that?

01:41:36.834 --> 01:41:38.400
Well, we want to build them.

01:41:38.400 --> 01:41:40.180
In order to build
them, we have to know

01:41:40.180 --> 01:41:44.020
how animals locomote, locomate,
how they move, how they walk.

01:41:44.020 --> 01:41:45.560
And you guys study carnivores.

01:41:45.560 --> 01:41:46.960
And carnivores run around a lot.

01:41:46.960 --> 01:41:48.460
So we want to hear you guys.

01:41:48.460 --> 01:41:50.430
Tell us how your animals
move when they're

01:41:50.430 --> 01:41:52.400
doing things like hunting.

01:41:52.400 --> 01:41:55.160
And America's carnivore
biologists listen to this,

01:41:55.160 --> 01:41:57.100
and say, this makes
no sense at all.

01:41:57.100 --> 01:41:59.030
You want to learn about
locomotion in animals.

01:41:59.030 --> 01:42:01.690
You get bioengineering people.

01:42:01.690 --> 01:42:03.370
You don't get zoologists.

01:42:03.370 --> 01:42:04.400
What's going on here?

01:42:04.400 --> 01:42:06.430
So all of America's
carnivore biologists

01:42:06.430 --> 01:42:09.250
proceed to go and sort of
huddle there, and decide

01:42:09.250 --> 01:42:10.250
they're going on strike.

01:42:10.250 --> 01:42:11.958
They are not going to
give any more talks

01:42:11.958 --> 01:42:13.660
until people explain what's up.

01:42:13.660 --> 01:42:16.380
They eat all the donuts that
are left, go to the bar,

01:42:16.380 --> 01:42:17.005
start drinking.

01:42:17.005 --> 01:42:18.838
And they're going to
refuse to have anything

01:42:18.838 --> 01:42:20.360
to do until these
colonels explain

01:42:20.360 --> 01:42:21.850
what's actually going on.

01:42:21.850 --> 01:42:24.430
So the colonels, obviously,
need to get on the phone

01:42:24.430 --> 01:42:27.030
to Washington, and call
up, and get permission.

01:42:27.030 --> 01:42:29.887
They come back and say, OK,
OK, because you guys are all

01:42:29.887 --> 01:42:32.470
our best friends, we're going
to tell you what's really going.

01:42:32.470 --> 01:42:34.589
We're really not making
Star Wars walkers.

01:42:34.589 --> 01:42:35.880
Here's what we're really doing.

01:42:35.880 --> 01:42:38.140
We're from the tank corps.

01:42:38.140 --> 01:42:40.310
And we've built this
new tank recently

01:42:40.310 --> 01:42:42.280
and it was what was
called the Sherman tank.

01:42:42.280 --> 01:42:43.789
And apparently for
all of history,

01:42:43.789 --> 01:42:46.080
what you do if you're in the
tank corps, is what you do

01:42:46.080 --> 01:42:48.300
is you just bash the
hell out of everything,

01:42:48.300 --> 01:42:50.210
and drive your tank
to the highest spot

01:42:50.210 --> 01:42:52.350
around, and just shoot
anything that moves.

01:42:52.350 --> 01:42:55.529
But the Sherman tank apparently
was like the greatest tank

01:42:55.529 --> 01:42:56.570
that had ever been built.

01:42:56.570 --> 01:42:59.150
It could drive like
60 miles an hour.

01:42:59.150 --> 01:43:02.540
And it could fire missiles when
it was bouncing upside down

01:43:02.540 --> 01:43:05.770
out of ditches, and
gyroscopic this and that.

01:43:05.770 --> 01:43:07.910
And it was the greatest,
most mobile tank.

01:43:07.910 --> 01:43:09.570
And they were having
a problem, which

01:43:09.570 --> 01:43:11.680
was they would put in
their tank corps in there.

01:43:11.680 --> 01:43:13.720
And what they would do was bash
the hell out of everything,

01:43:13.720 --> 01:43:15.886
and drive to the highest
spot around, and just shoot

01:43:15.886 --> 01:43:16.850
anything that moved.

01:43:16.850 --> 01:43:19.960
So the US Army Corps
decided that they

01:43:19.960 --> 01:43:23.300
needed to teach their troops,
their army, their tank corps,

01:43:23.300 --> 01:43:25.670
how to hunt like carnivores.

01:43:25.670 --> 01:43:28.500
And, thus, here they
invited all of America's

01:43:28.500 --> 01:43:31.590
carnivore biologists
to come in and teach us

01:43:31.590 --> 01:43:35.040
how to teach our tank crews
how to hunt like carnivores.

01:43:35.040 --> 01:43:36.520
How do you figure
out who's going

01:43:36.520 --> 01:43:38.317
to cut corners on the prey?

01:43:38.317 --> 01:43:40.900
How do you communicate if you're
out of sight with each other?

01:43:40.900 --> 01:43:42.350
What do your hyenas do?

01:43:42.350 --> 01:43:43.680
What do your wolves do?

01:43:43.680 --> 01:43:45.180
What do your coyotes do?

01:43:45.180 --> 01:43:48.280
So at that point, like, all of
America's carnivore biologists

01:43:48.280 --> 01:43:52.140
say, whoa, we are way
in over our heads here.

01:43:52.140 --> 01:43:55.570
So a third of them
instantly march out

01:43:55.570 --> 01:43:58.320
shouting about Ho Chi
Minh or whatever, given

01:43:58.320 --> 01:44:00.924
the age group of most of
America's carnivore biologists.

01:44:00.924 --> 01:44:02.340
And the rest of
them huddle there.

01:44:02.340 --> 01:44:03.050
And they come back.

01:44:03.050 --> 01:44:04.510
And they say, well,
these are very

01:44:04.510 --> 01:44:06.384
difficult questions to answer.

01:44:06.384 --> 01:44:08.550
So the military guys say,
well, yes we will give you

01:44:08.550 --> 01:44:09.880
money for your research.

01:44:09.880 --> 01:44:12.420
So at that point, all of
America's carnivore biologists

01:44:12.420 --> 01:44:15.000
decide they're now best friends
with these Army Corps guys.

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:16.760
They go through the rest of
the conference telling them

01:44:16.760 --> 01:44:18.880
all about the hunting
techniques of their animals,

01:44:18.880 --> 01:44:21.540
and with careful instructions
as to who to submit grants to.

01:44:21.540 --> 01:44:24.540
They all immediately go back to
the universities, write grants.

01:44:24.540 --> 01:44:28.320
My friend writes this grant
for like four Sherman tanks,

01:44:28.320 --> 01:44:31.860
and night viewing goggles
for like a Death Star

01:44:31.860 --> 01:44:34.480
and flamethrowers for his
hyenas, and all of that.

01:44:34.480 --> 01:44:36.600
All of America's
carnivore biologists

01:44:36.600 --> 01:44:39.830
send in their grant proposals
to this PO Box at the Pentagon.

01:44:39.830 --> 01:44:43.760
And nobody has ever heard from
any of these Army guys again.

01:44:43.760 --> 01:44:45.560
And this was about 15 years ago.

01:44:45.560 --> 01:44:47.750
And to this day,
none of them know

01:44:47.750 --> 01:44:50.210
what were these people
really trying to find out

01:44:50.210 --> 01:44:51.510
from us at this meeting?

01:44:51.510 --> 01:44:53.900
This was this totally
bizarre incident

01:44:53.900 --> 01:44:55.945
showing that somebody or
other in the tank corps

01:44:55.945 --> 01:44:57.580
is sitting around
trying to figure out

01:44:57.580 --> 01:45:02.084
what it is that the coyotes,
and marmots, and hyenas do.

01:45:02.084 --> 01:45:05.750

00:00:04.992 --> 00:00:05.825
Stanford University.

00:00:05.825 --> 00:00:08.039
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:09.940
So back a little bit.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:11.580
Still back in the neurobiology.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.130
Back to the anterior cingulate.

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.280
Remember anterior
cingulate again.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.500
All that empathy stuff,
feeling somebody else's pain.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.880
That business about
something metaphorical,

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.060
something symbolic
about pain and empathy

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.320
is happening in there.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.230
Something people
have been speculating

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.690
about for about 10
years now has to do

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:31.520
with a class of
neurons that have come

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.030
to be called mirror neurons.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.100
Mirror neurons were
first identified

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.810
in motor parts of the
cortex, parts that

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.390
tell you which muscles to move.

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.560
And these are neurons
that don't get excited

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.580
when you are, for example,
moving your arm like this.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.450
And they don't get excited
if you're watching somebody

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.150
moving their arm like this.

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.380
But they do get
excited if both of you

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.280
are doing it at the same time or
closely in time with each other

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.220
if they're mirroring each other.

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.570
So people took a
look at this and this

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.660
immediately became an
area of a lot of research.

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:08.280
And from the first nanosecond
when people were discussing

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.710
mirror neurons, of course
what they were immediately

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.530
talking about is this is
some neuronal cellular basis

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.590
of empathy, feeling
somebody else's pain.

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:19.640
That sort of thing.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.600
There's got to be mirror neurons
in the anterior cingulate

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.740
that's doing more abstract
versions of feeling somebody

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.820
else's actions and feeling
somebody else's feelings

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.030
and all that sort of thing.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.810
Totally irresistible.

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.360
There has not been
a paper written

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.090
on the neurobiology of
empathy in the last decade

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.050
without the word mirror getting
some place or other in there.

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:42.630
Totally cool idea.

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.770
Still not yet demonstrated.

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.950
Shifting over, covering
a little more ground.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.190
That business again
about sort of storage

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.740
of very abstract new
stuff, symbolic stuff,

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.700
into our clanky old
mammalian brains.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.020
The notion of having to mix in
symbolic metaphorical functions

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.200
into areas of the brain
that do it very literally.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.880
What comes through with
that is strong support

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.380
for the argument of someone like
Haidt, that guy the other day,

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.800
arguing that moral reasoning
is mostly after the fact.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.570
It's rationalization
for moral affect.

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.870
Mostly what we're having is
an initial moral affective

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.160
responses.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.180
And that's built around
the power of, for example,

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.070
a symbolic moral failure to
cause the same neurons to get

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.250
excited in your brain that would
tell you that you're disgusted

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.770
with rotten food, the
visceralness, the sort

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:41.980
of salience of it,
the whole notion

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.110
there being in his work
more and more support

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.900
for it that an awful lot
of the time moral reasoning

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.290
is coming after the moral
decision has been made

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.100
along the lines of affect.

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.170
And a lot of the brain
imaging work by now

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.860
is showing evidence for this.

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.800
And again, the strongest
sort of evidence

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.080
is when you go through
the list of things,

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.480
would you eat your
pet after it died?

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.260
Is incest OK if it's
post-reproductive?

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.530
And all the ways in which people
say, I can't tell you why,

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:11.680
but it's wrong.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.080
That shouldn't be allowed.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.640
And what that is over
and over in those cases

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.200
is a demonstration of the
affective moral decision making

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.200
coming before the
moral reasoning.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.900
So really important
feature of his work.

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.800
Backfilling on some
neurotransmitter stuff,

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:28.770
neurochemistry.

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:33.530
I managed to completely forget
poor, innocent serotonin coming

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:34.530
into the picture.

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.480
What we covered on
Wednesday was dopamine

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.410
and the ability of
dopamine to, in effect,

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.660
give the frontal
cortex the energy

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.550
to do the emotional
regulation stuff.

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:46.930
In effect, if what
the frontal cortex

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.140
is saying to all of
the limbic system

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.940
on many occasions is,
don't do, it don't do it,

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.540
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.520
What the dopaminergic
projections

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.620
into the frontal
cortex are doing

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.120
is telling the frontal cortex,
tell the limbic system not

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.190
to do it because it's going to
be amazing if they can hold out

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:05.080
down there.

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.220
The dopamine system, in terms
of the anticipation of reward.

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.390
Now switching over to
another neurotransmitter

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.402
that gets lots of attention
in this business-- serotonin.

00:04:15.402 --> 00:04:16.860
Before it's over
with, we are going

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:19.540
to hear about serotonin
in coming weeks having

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.150
to do with a bunch of different
psychiatric disorders.

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.150
But this is serotonin in some
frontal cortical related areas

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.430
of the brain seeming
to have something

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.050
to do with aggression
and impulsive behavior.

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:33.240
What's the evidence?

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.150
First off, the totally
correlative stuff.

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.310
Look at levels of serotonin in
animals, experimental animals,

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.610
in these projection areas that
go into the frontal cortex.

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:48.560
Lower levels of serotonin
predicting more impulsive,

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.450
more aggressive behavior.

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:52.610
Consistent finding in the field.

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:56.900
Consistent finding when you then
switch over to humans and look

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.929
at something that you
cannot do in a human,

00:04:59.929 --> 00:05:02.220
not looking at something that
you can't do in a human--

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:03.040
whatever.

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.950
You can't look at serotonin
levels and somebody's brain

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:08.630
because you're not going to
slice it out and measure stuff.

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:10.310
What that whole
literature is about

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.580
is instead looking at
this synthetic pathway.

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:18.020
How is serotonin broken
down, these two enzymes here.

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.660
MOA, monoamine oxidase,
this one broken down

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:25.680
into a waste product called
5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid.

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.140
Do not write that down.

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:28.370
5-HIAA.

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.850
The main point being
that in a human

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:33.350
you can't measure levels
of this very readily.

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:35.540
You measure this in
the blood stream,

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:40.080
in the cerebral spinal fluid,
in the urine, places like that.

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.820
And the literature is
showing that lower levels

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:46.080
of serotonin breakdown
products are correlated

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.980
in humans with higher levels
of aggression and antisocial

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:51.730
behavior.

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:54.640
You should be able to rip that
one to shreds within seconds.

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.270
Number one, this
is just correlative

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:59.880
and you could very easily
imagine horses and carts

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.470
getting all confused here.

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:03.780
The second thing
is remember when

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.130
you're measuring
neurotransmitter junk

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:07.980
in the bloodstream
or the urine, you're

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:11.329
measuring the junk of all the
gazillion different places

00:06:11.329 --> 00:06:12.995
in the brain where
this neurotransmitter

00:06:12.995 --> 00:06:17.000
is being used for things have
nothing to do with aspects

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.890
of aggression, impulsivity.

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:21.170
It's really hard
to tell anything.

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:22.800
Nonetheless, the
animal literature

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.540
has been pretty
consistent with this.

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:26.010
So back to correlation.

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:28.100
Which is causing which,
which is causing which?

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:29.940
Then you could do
the animal studies

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:34.660
showing that when you manipulate
serotonin levels in something

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:36.940
like a rat or a
primate, drive down

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:40.040
serotonin levels in the
frontal cortical region

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.700
and you get more
aggressive behavior.

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:44.730
You get more impulsivity.

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:47.700
So evidence for that there
actually being causal.

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:49.950
Something similar
or a building block

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:52.290
of that, studies that
have been done in humans.

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:53.800
You don't slice
somebody's head open

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.340
and measure their
serotonin levels,

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:57.320
but instead in
this case you give

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:01.840
a drug which, for a short
period, will mimic serotonin.

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:04.120
and It will mimic serotonin
in the way serotonin

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:06.860
interacts with the receptors
in the frontal cortex,

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:09.620
your buzzing serotonin pathways.

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:12.150
In those individuals in
the frontal cortex what do

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:13.740
you wind up seeing?

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:16.710
Increased metabolism
in the frontal cortex.

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:20.600
Serotonin stimulates
frontal metabolism

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:26.130
except in individuals with a
history of antisocial violence.

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:27.950
What's that
beginning to suggest?

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:31.890
Part of what serotonin is doing
is joining in with dopamine

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:34.250
to stimulate the
frontal cortex, get

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:37.510
the I wouldn't do that if I
were you really, really, hold on

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:40.430
don't do it, pathways
down to the limbic system.

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:43.000
And part of the
evidence we're seeing,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.870
violent sociopaths having lower
than normal metabolic rates

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:48.250
in the frontal cortex.

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:51.450
Some of these pieces
beginning to come together.

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:55.120
So a lot is relevant in
terms of levels of this.

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:58.390
Immediately one
starts thinking genes.

00:07:58.390 --> 00:08:02.540
Genes related to the various
types of serotonin receptors.

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:04.710
Genes related to the
enzymes that make

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:06.670
serotonin, that break it down.

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:10.410
And there's a literature
that's emerging on that one.

00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:14.510
First off, it is a really tough
literature to make sense of.

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:17.520
As follows, suppose
you are studying

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:20.570
some population of people
who are very aggressive

00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:22.500
and you're measuring
this breakdown

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:24.810
product in their bloodstream
and you see there's

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:27.780
very low levels in the stuff.

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:28.660
OK.

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:31.320
So how do you interpret that if?

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:35.049
You believe that low
levels of serotonin

00:08:35.049 --> 00:08:36.650
give rise to aggression.

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:38.590
So what's your interpretation?

00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:41.059
Low levels of this,
because you're not

00:08:41.059 --> 00:08:42.340
making much serotonin.

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:43.840
If you're not making
much serotonin,

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:46.270
you're not getting much
serotonin breakdown product,

00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:48.470
support for the idea
that aggression is

00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:51.750
caused by too little serotonin.

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:55.810
Suppose instead you like the
idea of too much serotonin

00:08:55.810 --> 00:08:56.970
causing aggression.

00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:58.450
What would you then say?

00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:00.520
Well, suppose there
is a mutation in one

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:04.360
of these enzymes that's supposed
to break down serotonin.

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:06.450
And because of the
mutation, it doesn't.

00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:07.560
What's going to happen?

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:10.880
Serotonin doesn't get broken
down, it's levels build up,

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:13.630
and thus you'll see
low levels of that.

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:16.500
In other words, the
same exact finding

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:19.600
can tell either elevated or
lower than normal levels.

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.834
Completely uninterpretable
when you're

00:09:21.834 --> 00:09:23.500
trying to make sense
of what's happening

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:26.250
in an organism like a human
where you can't actually

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:27.670
measure at this step.

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:29.520
So there could be low
levels because there

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:30.910
is low levels of everything.

00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:32.680
Or there could be
low levels because,

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:36.370
thanks to a blockade here, the
levels of this are building up.

00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:39.160
Totally impossible to
separate those out.

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:40.880
In some of the
studies in the field

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:44.750
have really strongly voted
for one type of conclusion

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:47.310
based on human studies
measuring that stuff

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:49.840
where it simply can't be done.

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:51.630
How about the genetics, though?

00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:57.530
What you see are differences
in variance of the gene.

00:09:57.530 --> 00:10:00.240
That's the critical one
for making serotonin.

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:04.030
Basically concept, if
you're not a bio chem type,

00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:06.960
if there is a couple of steps
needed to make something

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:09.620
and one step is really,
really important,

00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:11.770
basically like if
this first step

00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:14.680
occurs you're guaranteed
that the second one will.

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:17.470
And the first step is the
one that's a little bit iffy.

00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:20.450
That would be referred
to as the rate limiting

00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:22.180
step in the pathway.

00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:26.740
The rate limiting enzyme, this
enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase,

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:30.790
is the rate limiting step in
the synthesis of serotonin.

00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:34.360
And by now, there is a
literature showing variance

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:37.120
on tryptophan
hydroxylase in people.

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:40.100
Variance in non-human
primates that

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:43.960
begin to correlate a bit
with how much of this,

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:45.290
how much of aggression.

00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:46.400
Not big effects.

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:49.310
Back to our statistics lecture,
the findings are there.

00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:51.270
They're not big effects, though.

00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:53.250
Meanwhile, at the
other end, people

00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:56.990
have been looking at genetic
variants on these guys

00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:59.460
and that literature is
coming through also.

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:01.120
Different variants
that appear to have

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:03.790
different levels of
activity correlated

00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:06.670
with different levels of
aggression, different levels

00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:08.130
of breakdown products.

00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:10.290
So that's out there as well.

00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:13.770
But immediately we've got
something going straight back

00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:16.680
to four different earlier
lectures, the point being made

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:20.840
over and over, scale graph
by now where exactly where

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:23.810
this one is heading-- if
I can get the right ink--

00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:38.690
which is-- OK.

00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:42.880
So variants on this MAO
gene, this monoamine oxidase.

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:45.590
It comes in two
different flavors.

00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:48.590
And what you've got is in
terms of how they function.

00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:51.590
One of them should
be predisposing

00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:55.740
towards more serotonin
signaling than the other.

00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:58.980
And thus you would predict that
the one that predisposes you

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:02.260
towards less serotonin
signaling in the frontal cortex

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.690
should be associated with
higher levels of aggression.

00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:09.330
And thus we go back to that same
exact study, that same group

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:11.470
that did the study
looking at the interaction

00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:14.990
between depression, serotonin
transporter gene, all of that,

00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:16.420
looking at those data.

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:20.480
Now what they were asking
was by age 25 or so

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:24.530
what was the incidence of
antisocial violent behavior

00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:27.300
in this population
of 17,000 kids

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:31.220
and what does that have to
do with which variant of MAO

00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:31.970
they had?

00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:35.090
And it's the exact
same punchline by now.

00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:38.400
This is the depression
gene environment, stress,

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:40.810
figurative,
superimposable with this.

00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:42.860
It's the exact same punchline.

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:47.440
Having the bad version
of monoamine oxidase gene

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:52.280
does not increase your risk of
antisocial violent behavior.

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:54.540
Having the bad
version of the gene

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:59.670
and getting brought up in an
environment with abuse vastly

00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:01.020
increased likelihood.

00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:03.580
And what they showed in
there was the number of times

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:06.150
of major physical
abuse during childhood,

00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:08.110
the more that was
the case, the more

00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:09.700
there was an interaction here.

00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:11.710
Having the good
version growing up

00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:13.640
in a more abusive
setting, yes, it

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:16.210
increases the odds of
antisocial behavior.

00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:17.520
Not a big effect, though.

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:18.970
What do we got here?

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:22.030
Yet another gene
environment interaction.

00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:24.970
By now you should be
utterly unwilling to say

00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:27.430
whether any gene
does anything here

00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:30.470
outside the context of saying,
in what sort of setting,

00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:31.870
with what sort of background?

00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:34.550
Huge interaction here.

00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:38.870
So giving a sense here of where
serotonin is fitting into it.

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:42.490
Next piece of neurochemistry
that's relevany-- and this

00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:44.210
is not a
neurotransmitter, but this

00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:46.150
is a nuerochemical
that occasionally

00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:50.070
gets put into the nervous
system, which is alcohol.

00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:50.660
Alcohol.

00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:54.300
What doe alcohol do
first to neurons on sort

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:55.980
of the nuts and bolts level?

00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:59.930
Is alcohol a mimicker of any
particular neurotransmitter?

00:13:59.930 --> 00:14:00.640
No.

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:03.380
Does alcohol bind to
any particular class

00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:05.220
of neurotransmitter receptor?

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:06.760
No, not that either.

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:11.390
Alcohol seems to have some
remarkably nonspecific effects

00:14:11.390 --> 00:14:13.260
in terms of how cells function.

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:16.120
All one could say at
this point is alcohol

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:18.590
is not equal to--
it's kind of working

00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:20.580
like this neurotransmitter
or that enzyme

00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:22.120
or that-- it's not that clean.

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:25.820
It is a messy drug with lots
of effects in the brain.

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:27.820
So what does alcohol have
to do with aggression?

00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:29.390
Everybody knows
the answer to that,

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:33.100
which is alcohol increases
levels of aggression.

00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:34.240
Everybody knows this.

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:35.830
Everybody knows
this and the guy who

00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:37.490
gets a couple of
drinks under his built

00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:40.270
and is flinging people out
the bar soon afterward.

00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:42.730
Alcohol increases aggression.

00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:46.940
What you find, in fact, is there
is no significant relationship

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:48.000
between the two.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.060
A huge literature
examining this by now.

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:55.770
And what you see instead is
one of our if then contingent

00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:56.860
themes here.

00:14:56.860 --> 00:15:00.420
Over and over you're getting
this sort of thing coming up.

00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:04.170
Alcohol does not cause
people to be aggressive.

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:06.780
Alcohol causes
people who already

00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:10.140
are aggressive to
become more aggressive.

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:13.620
Alcohol causes people who
are unaggressive to become

00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:14.930
more inhibited.

00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:18.150
What alcohol does
is merely magnify

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:20.590
the preexisting
social tendencies.

00:15:20.590 --> 00:15:22.070
This theme over and over again.

00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:25.150
That's exactly what testosterone
was doing two days ago.

00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:28.250
Testosterone does not make
number three ranking rhesus

00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:30.700
monkeys start attacking
number two and number one.

00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:33.830
It makes them absolutely
torture numbers four and five.

00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:36.380
Testosterone does not
create aggression.

00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:40.100
It amplifies preexisting social
patterns [INAUDIBLE] that's

00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:43.830
our remove the testosterone
and aggression doesn't go down

00:15:43.830 --> 00:15:44.830
to 0%.

00:15:44.830 --> 00:15:48.620
Interaction with social
history, same exact theme again.

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:50.820
Alcohol does not
cause aggression.

00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:53.340
It amplifies
aggressiveness in people

00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:56.660
who already are aggressive.

00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:59.690
Along with that, sort of
as a confounding factor,

00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:02.160
we have this problem that
everybody knows that alcohol

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:03.430
makes you more aggressive.

00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:05.420
And what has also
been shown in studies

00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:08.250
is that if you tell
people that you have just

00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:10.160
raised their blood
alcohol levels

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:13.810
infusing in either alcohol
or infusing in saline.

00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:16.120
And what you see is
when people believe

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:18.300
their blood alcohol
levels have risen

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:20.070
they become more aggressive.

00:16:20.070 --> 00:16:21.860
What is alcohol about?

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:26.800
Alcohol allows you to give
voice to those preexisting

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:29.400
social tendencies
towards aggression.

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:33.090
Modifier over and over
again this sort of theme.

00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:35.370
And this has been studied
in all sorts of contexts.

00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:37.370
One really interesting
domain have

00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:39.380
been people who--
anthropologists

00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:42.910
who basically study how
people in different cultures

00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:46.166
learn to get drunk.

00:16:46.166 --> 00:16:47.290
That's kind of interesting.

00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:49.706
That must be an interesting
thing to spend your career on.

00:16:49.706 --> 00:16:50.800
What is this about?

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:53.550
Looking at-- one of the
people who does this work,

00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:57.050
looking at this whole issue
of populations that did not

00:16:57.050 --> 00:16:59.230
have a prior history
of heavy alcohol

00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:03.220
use before some explicit
transitional event.

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:05.450
And what that usually
translates that into

00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:07.540
is Polynesian
islands that did not

00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:10.920
have much alcohol before
they were touched by the West

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:14.980
during World War II with alcohol
brought in heavily after that.

00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:18.270
So the question becomes,
what are people's behaviors

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:20.319
like in these cultures
as they are first

00:17:20.319 --> 00:17:23.440
having a culture of
people drinking to excess?

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:26.210
And the answer is, it depends.

00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:29.600
It depends on the people who
are teaching you to drink.

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:31.520
And what you see
is an interaction

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:34.570
between the type
of colonial power

00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:37.640
that controlled the island at
the time and what people did.

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:40.590
And you would see in
British controlled islands,

00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:42.640
American controlled
islands, people

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:44.330
would start
realizing that you're

00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:47.650
supposed to be aggressive and
become more violent when you're

00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:48.370
drunk.

00:17:48.370 --> 00:17:51.782
Meanwhile, over in like French
Tahiti, people get drunk

00:17:51.782 --> 00:17:53.240
and they all sleep
with each other.

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:53.740
Aha.

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:54.700
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:57.780
It's a cultural context
specific sort of thing.

00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:00.770
This shown over and over again.

00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:02.830
So a little bit on the
neurochemistry here.

00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:05.370
We then began
working our way left,

00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:08.280
looking first at
hormonal regulation,

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:10.440
the short-term hormonal effects.

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:11.970
Looking at testosterone.

00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:14.830
Let's also briefly
go to the other side

00:18:14.830 --> 00:18:18.530
around that time point, the
acute environmental releasers.

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:21.270
Aggression as our
fixed action pattern.

00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:25.530
What are some of the releasing
stimuli for aggression?

00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:29.310
Some of the most reliable ones
are ones that always, always

00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:32.260
demand you to interview an
animal in the same language

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:36.390
across different species Just as
with sexual behavior releasing

00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:39.970
stimuli, some species become
aggressive in response

00:18:39.970 --> 00:18:45.320
to smells, to sounds, to sights,
to our whole array with this.

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:46.420
Here's one version.

00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:49.860
Here's a species of ant that
gets aggressive in response

00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:51.210
to vibration.

00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:53.080
And these are ants
living in East Africa

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:56.440
that have a symbiotic
relationship with trees there

00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:57.840
acacia trees.

00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:01.730
And what happens is the acacia
trees grow these little sort

00:19:01.730 --> 00:19:06.980
of igloo bubbly spheroid
things on their branches, which

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:09.810
have holes in them and
which provide perfect living

00:19:09.810 --> 00:19:11.340
environments for the ants.

00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:13.700
So acacia trees are
giving ants a home.

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:16.840
And what the ants do in return
is they protect the acacia tree

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:18.210
from herbivores.

00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:19.830
Herbivores eating their leaves.

00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:20.650
What happens?

00:19:20.650 --> 00:19:23.150
Along comes a giraffe
and begins to chew

00:19:23.150 --> 00:19:25.580
and it breaks a branch
and the vibration

00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:28.390
causes all of these
ants to come pouring out

00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:30.430
and bite the giraffe's lips.

00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:32.820
At which point the giraffe
goes to a different tree.

00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:35.500
So we see in that case,
what's the releasing stimulus?

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:37.390
Go and shake a branch
and you suddenly

00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:39.840
have 4,000 ants angry at you.

00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:43.100
All these deals again and
again, interviewing an animal

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:44.470
in its own language.

00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:47.980
So what are some of the reliable
releasing stimuli in humans?

00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:50.370
Same theme as with
the sexual behavior.

00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:53.800
We don't have any auditory
stimuli that automatically

00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:54.870
trigger aggression.

00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:56.760
We don't have any
olfactory ones.

00:19:56.760 --> 00:20:00.040
We don't have any-- we've
got some subliminal ones.

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:02.720
Remember that study
mentioned a few weeks back.

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:05.810
Take sweat from someone
who is frightened

00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:07.440
as opposed to the
same amount of sweat

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:09.820
from someone who's been
happily exercising.

00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:12.520
That was the deal of swabbing
the arm pits of people

00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:14.000
jumping out of airplanes.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.290
Take sweat from someone
who is frightened

00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:20.220
and subliminal exposure to
it, the amygdala activates.

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:22.750
So we're not completely
free of sensory stuff,

00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:25.880
but we're not triggered in
any sort of way that's as

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:27.700
dramatic as in other species.

00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:32.180
So what sort of multi-sensory,
multi-modal sort of things

00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:33.550
trigger aggression?

00:20:33.550 --> 00:20:37.290
Number one, most
reliable one, is pain.

00:20:37.290 --> 00:20:40.500
Make an organism feel
pained and you have greatly

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:43.470
increased its likelihood of
turning around and biting

00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:45.230
the closest thing to it.

00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:48.210
So pain as a trigger for it.

00:20:48.210 --> 00:20:50.560
Frustration as a trigger.

00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:51.930
Take a rat.

00:20:51.930 --> 00:20:54.940
Train it to press a lever
10 times, it gets its food.

00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:56.310
10 times, get its food.

00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:57.930
10 times, it doesn't
get its food.

00:20:57.930 --> 00:21:00.210
10 times, you're not
giving it its food.

00:21:00.210 --> 00:21:01.950
Get the rat good and frustrated.

00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:03.840
And with great
reliability if there

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:05.500
is another rat
sitting there, it's

00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:07.570
going to spin
around and bite it.

00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:11.460
So displacement aggression,
being driven there

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:14.690
by frustration, by pain,
things of that sort.

00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:19.580
And what's really depressing is
if you were a rat or a primate

00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:22.250
and you were sitting there
being frustrated by not getting

00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:24.760
a reward and your
glucocorticoid levels

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:27.270
have risen, go and
bite somebody else

00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:30.640
and your glucocorticoid
levels will go down.

00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:32.980
And there we describe a
very depressing feature

00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:34.330
about our social world.

00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:36.880
Displacing aggression
on somebody else

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:40.350
in species after species
is stress reducing.

00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:41.480
So triggers.

00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:43.110
Triggers for that.

00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:46.630
Great example of this
and a remarkable one,

00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:48.580
back to that business
from a couple of weeks

00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:53.640
ago, that alternative mating
strategy of orangutan males.

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:55.140
That business that
after hearing all

00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:58.700
that heartwarming alternative
strategy stuff of male

00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:01.220
baboons forming
friendships with females.

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:03.910
Meanwhile, the alternative
strategy with a orangutan

00:22:03.910 --> 00:22:07.000
males being something
that absolutely fits

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.850
all the definitions of rape.

00:22:08.850 --> 00:22:10.590
Well, do you see
anything like that

00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:12.540
in some other primate species?

00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:16.620
And you see it every now
and then among male baboons.

00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:20.870
Again, defined as
forced sex with a female

00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:22.580
who actively
attempts to get away

00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:24.540
and actively attempts to resist.

00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:27.060
What you see under
that sort of definition

00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:31.330
is every now and then it
will happen in baboons.

00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:33.050
What is the circumstance?

00:22:33.050 --> 00:22:35.070
I've seen it three
times over the years.

00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:37.370
Other people have seen
it occasionally as well.

00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:39.960
It's always the exact
same circumstance.

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:43.700
It is the number one male
on the day or the day

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:45.710
after that he has
just been dumped out

00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:47.590
of his alpha position.

00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:51.630
And most of the time the animal
goes and mopes somewhere else.

00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:53.650
Most of the time the
animal mopes and then

00:22:53.650 --> 00:22:55.790
finds somebody
smaller to beat up on.

00:22:55.790 --> 00:22:59.170
The only times I've seen this
over all these years, that

00:22:59.170 --> 00:23:01.170
was exactly the circumstance.

00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:04.060
Frustration, aggression
displacement.

00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:06.390
Very, very familiar.

00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:09.110
When we get to some more
environmental factors later on,

00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:12.220
some of the big ones, what we
will deal with in this context

00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:15.180
is the relationship
between why is it

00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:18.030
that when the economy gets
bad, violence goes up.

00:23:18.030 --> 00:23:20.610
Why does poverty breed violence?

00:23:20.610 --> 00:23:22.330
And this is
consistently the case.

00:23:22.330 --> 00:23:24.110
Why is that occurring?

00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:26.700
Some framing theoretically
within the context

00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:30.130
of frustration and
pain and stress

00:23:30.130 --> 00:23:34.400
are really reliable predictors
of aggressive behavior.

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:38.060
But again, it's the same
theme as with alcohol.

00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:40.760
Pain makes organisms
that are already

00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:44.690
predisposed towards being
aggressive more aggressive.

00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:47.810
It does not do so
uniformly across the board.

00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:50.610
Frustration, the
same exact thing.

00:23:50.610 --> 00:23:54.460
Once again, we have something
modulating, amplifying,

00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:57.580
blunting, damping, all
this sort of theme again

00:23:57.580 --> 00:24:00.360
and again, some
other factor there.

00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:01.820
Another example of this.

00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:04.080
Another environmental
trigger-- and study

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:07.806
this subject somewhere in the
1950s or so and the top thing

00:24:07.806 --> 00:24:09.430
that you would get
on the list in terms

00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:12.570
of environmental
releasers for aggression

00:24:12.570 --> 00:24:15.270
would be overcrowding.

00:24:15.270 --> 00:24:18.000
This was a whole literature
that emerged at the time.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.380
A psychologist named
Calhoun, John Calhoun,

00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:21.720
started this whole field.

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:24.260
And what he would do
was take a bunch of rats

00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:28.350
living in an enclosure
of a certain size

00:24:28.350 --> 00:24:30.020
and go about observing them.

00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:32.030
And they're going about
their rat business.

00:24:32.030 --> 00:24:35.250
And now put all of them
into a much smaller space,

00:24:35.250 --> 00:24:37.780
a higher density, crowd them.

00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:41.370
And what he reported
was aggression explodes

00:24:41.370 --> 00:24:42.010
at that point.

00:24:42.010 --> 00:24:44.050
Aggression goes
through the roof.

00:24:44.050 --> 00:24:45.730
Crowding causing aggression.

00:24:45.730 --> 00:24:47.730
The two factoids,
or rather the one

00:24:47.730 --> 00:24:50.790
factoid that everybody
learned from that literature

00:24:50.790 --> 00:24:53.580
for decades afterward from
the Scientific American papers

00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:56.210
was violence would
go up to the point

00:24:56.210 --> 00:24:59.810
that rats would start killing
and cannibalizing each other.

00:24:59.810 --> 00:25:03.660
Urban crowding making our next
generation of cannibals, which

00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:06.240
is exactly what an awful
lot of sociologists

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:08.070
are off running
with, not to mention

00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:09.910
various Southern
senators who talked

00:25:09.910 --> 00:25:13.240
about the menace of inner
city population density

00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:17.360
and spawning violence because
overcrowding causes aggression.

00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:19.680
Whole literature-- and
it took a number of years

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:22.550
until people started
looking a little bit closer

00:25:22.550 --> 00:25:23.690
at the animals.

00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:26.440
And on the average,
the rate of aggression

00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:29.480
does not change with crowding.

00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:32.340
You could probably fill in
the next sentence by now.

00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:34.857
What you see instead
is animals that

00:25:34.857 --> 00:25:36.940
are already aggressive
become more aggressive when

00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:37.565
you crowd them.

00:25:37.565 --> 00:25:39.910
Animals that are
subordinate and unaggressive

00:25:39.910 --> 00:25:42.050
become even more
weak and withdrawn.

00:25:42.050 --> 00:25:44.920
What these early generations
of studies were doing wrong

00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:48.310
was folks sitting there just
looking for the exciting stuff.

00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:49.150
Oh, my God.

00:25:49.150 --> 00:25:51.730
We just saw a rat
cannibalize another one.

00:25:51.730 --> 00:25:54.680
I sure never saw that
with a big enclosure.

00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:57.160
The actual quantitative
rates of aggression

00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:59.030
do not go up with crowding.

00:25:59.030 --> 00:26:02.330
Aggressive individuals
become more aggressive then.

00:26:02.330 --> 00:26:05.420
And we readily can fit
that into scenarios

00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:10.260
of frustration, displacement,
and that kind of thing.

00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:13.030
Now switching back to where
we started the other day,

00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:14.340
back to hormones.

00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:16.660
The short-term
hormonal exposure.

00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:19.330
And where we had
started with short-term

00:26:19.330 --> 00:26:21.390
not the hormonal
exposure back when

00:26:21.390 --> 00:26:23.530
you were a fetus, but
in the last minute,

00:26:23.530 --> 00:26:25.700
in the last hour, the
last couple of days.

00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:29.080
Where we started, of
course, was testosterone.

00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:31.020
And to summarize
that again, it is

00:26:31.020 --> 00:26:33.830
the same punchline as with
testosterone and sexual

00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:34.710
behavior.

00:26:34.710 --> 00:26:38.250
Testosterone is required
for the normal range

00:26:38.250 --> 00:26:41.260
of aggressive behavior in
every species looked at.

00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:45.580
When you castrate males,
levels of aggression go down.

00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:50.370
Just as critically levels of
aggression do not go down to 0.

00:26:50.370 --> 00:26:53.550
Very critically there, the
more prior social experience

00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:57.420
with aggression the more it is
maintained after castration.

00:26:57.420 --> 00:27:02.570
Replace the testosterone, 10%
of normal levels, 100%, 200%.

00:27:02.570 --> 00:27:04.880
All of them do the
exact same thing.

00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:07.530
The brain is sensitive
to testosterone,

00:27:07.530 --> 00:27:11.330
but it's not sensitive to
small little differences in it.

00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:14.850
So no individual who is more
aggressive than the person

00:27:14.850 --> 00:27:17.310
sitting next to
them, there is no way

00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:19.920
it can ever be
attributed to differences

00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:23.620
in testosterone levels in
the normal healthy range.

00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:26.970
Back to the same qualifier
from the sex lectures.

00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:30.900
Now take someone who instead of
having 200% the normal levels,

00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:34.160
twice the normal levels, they
have tenfold higher levels,

00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:37.110
higher than the body
ever normally sees

00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:39.950
because they are abusing
anabolic steroids

00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:43.210
and their levels of
aggression do indeed go up.

00:27:43.210 --> 00:27:45.190
But within the normal
range, you gotta

00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:47.950
have testosterone but
it is necessary but not

00:27:47.950 --> 00:27:49.240
sufficient for normal levels.

00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:52.080
The brain is not sensitive
to small little differences

00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:55.500
and it is overwhelmingly
modulatory.

00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:57.030
That same business again.

00:27:57.030 --> 00:27:59.200
Number three in the
hierarchy stoked

00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:01.910
on testosterone attacks
four and five more,

00:28:01.910 --> 00:28:03.680
doesn't bother with two and one.

00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:06.320
Exaggerating
preexisting tendencies.

00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:09.190
Testosterone is
shortening the lag time

00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:11.590
between action potentials
in the amygdala

00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:15.750
if and only if the
amygdala has gotten excited

00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:17.830
and, passing on
aggressive messages,

00:28:17.830 --> 00:28:20.610
testosterone amplifies
it, testosterone

00:28:20.610 --> 00:28:24.810
not as causing but as
modulating that same theme again

00:28:24.810 --> 00:28:26.016
and again.

00:28:26.016 --> 00:28:27.390
Finally, towards
the end of that,

00:28:27.390 --> 00:28:30.490
we heard about that in amazing
example of hyenas and their sex

00:28:30.490 --> 00:28:31.870
reversal system.

00:28:31.870 --> 00:28:35.080
One final interesting
feature of it, which is we

00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:38.480
live within 30 miles of
the world's only research

00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:41.450
colony of hyenas who live
up in the Berkeley hills.

00:28:41.450 --> 00:28:43.600
And if the wind
is just right, you

00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:45.620
can hear them whooping
in downtown Berkeley

00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:46.680
at night on occasion.

00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:50.251
And God knows how many religions
that has spawned over there.

00:28:50.251 --> 00:28:50.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:52.870
But they've got this
hyena colony there.

00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:56.390
And these were hyenas that were
brought over as pups from East

00:28:56.390 --> 00:28:59.800
Africa, from Kenya, as part
of studying this weird sex

00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:01.220
reversal system.

00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:03.630
Hyenas turn out to be
models for a whole bunch

00:29:03.630 --> 00:29:05.960
of gynecological
disorders having

00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:07.960
to do with the elevated
testosterone levels

00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:08.810
in the females.

00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:11.220
All of that-- they've now
gone through about 20 years

00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:14.110
in generations, but the
very first generation

00:29:14.110 --> 00:29:16.800
they had raised
a critical issue.

00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:19.810
Back to the other day,
hyenas' social systems,

00:29:19.810 --> 00:29:21.840
females are dominant to males.

00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:23.740
Females are more
aggressive than males.

00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:26.250
Females have higher
testosterone levels.

00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:28.790
So the question becomes,
you've got a whole bunch

00:29:28.790 --> 00:29:33.490
of hyenas that were brought over
as pups raised without mothers,

00:29:33.490 --> 00:29:37.070
raised in something
other than a normal hyena

00:29:37.070 --> 00:29:38.940
clan of watching adults.

00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:42.660
They're all growing up as pups
together without adult models.

00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:44.900
Are females going
to still wind up

00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:47.120
being more aggressive
than males?

00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:50.290
And what they saw
was, yes, indeed.

00:29:50.290 --> 00:29:53.990
Females had the same normal
higher testosterone levels

00:29:53.990 --> 00:29:56.670
as you would find in wild
hyenas, the same weirdo

00:29:56.670 --> 00:29:57.950
genitals, all of that.

00:29:57.950 --> 00:30:00.580
And females were
socially dominant.

00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:01.280
Whoa.

00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:05.200
Hormones and bizarre
fake scrotums is destiny.

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:10.120
But what they saw was it took
years for the dominant system

00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:12.570
to emerge with the
females dominating.

00:30:12.570 --> 00:30:14.150
It took far longer.

00:30:14.150 --> 00:30:17.130
What's that telling us about
normal hyenas out there?

00:30:17.130 --> 00:30:20.550
It's a mixture of you
having lots of testosterone

00:30:20.550 --> 00:30:23.150
on board and its
physiological consequences

00:30:23.150 --> 00:30:26.310
and you getting to
watch Mom terrorizing

00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:27.930
the males in the neighborhood.

00:30:27.930 --> 00:30:30.985
So once again, a combination
between social factors,

00:30:30.985 --> 00:30:32.560
endocrine modulators.

00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:36.800
They eventually got to a classic
female dominated social system.

00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:39.480
It took them a
lot longer though.

00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:45.019
Next hormone, hormones to look
at, estrogen, progesterone.

00:30:45.019 --> 00:30:47.060
Back to, no, we're not
going to look at that yet.

00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:47.720
Hold on.

00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:48.320
Stop.

00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:49.070
All of you.

00:30:49.070 --> 00:30:52.460
Next what we look at are
testosterone levels in females.

00:30:52.460 --> 00:30:53.090
Oh, yes.

00:30:53.090 --> 00:30:53.870
That again.

00:30:53.870 --> 00:30:55.980
Same exact thing as
from the sex lecture,

00:30:55.980 --> 00:30:57.450
substituted from there.

00:30:57.450 --> 00:31:00.340
Females generates certain
levels of testosterone

00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:03.380
of related androgens
from the adrenal gland,

00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:07.420
adrenal androgens, maybe 5%
the levels you see in males.

00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:10.120
And what we saw
last week is female

00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:14.980
proceptive sexual behavior
is dependent on testosterone.

00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:16.840
Same exact deal.

00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:19.200
Take out the
adrenals of a woman,

00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:21.290
testosterone levels
drop down to 0

00:31:21.290 --> 00:31:25.390
at that point and levels of
sexual libido, proceptivity,

00:31:25.390 --> 00:31:26.090
go down.

00:31:26.090 --> 00:31:27.430
Not all the way down.

00:31:27.430 --> 00:31:29.920
Depends on how much prior
social experience, same song

00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:30.630
and dance.

00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:32.980
And same song and dance here.

00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:33.900
Aggression.

00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:36.560
Aggression in females
of various species

00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:39.720
is amplified by the
adrenal androgrens.

00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:42.510
Those low levels castrate.

00:31:42.510 --> 00:31:43.140
Goes down.

00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:44.110
Not all the way down.

00:31:44.110 --> 00:31:45.640
Same exact deal again.

00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:50.390
It is modulatory in females
as well as in males.

00:31:50.390 --> 00:31:53.380
Now leaping to estrogen
and progesterone.

00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:56.310
What's up with them in
terms of aggression?

00:31:56.310 --> 00:31:59.590
And we had first hints of it
from the very first lecture,

00:31:59.590 --> 00:32:02.910
that business that a
disproportionate share

00:32:02.910 --> 00:32:06.150
of female violence is
carried out by women

00:32:06.150 --> 00:32:08.250
in their perimenstrual period.

00:32:08.250 --> 00:32:11.530
The whole notion of
perimenstrual syndrome

00:32:11.530 --> 00:32:13.720
increasing aggression.

00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:15.550
This has been around
for a long time

00:32:15.550 --> 00:32:18.600
and this holds up in
some criminology studies,

00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:20.140
though what you see
here, of course,

00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:23.600
is a gazillion different
ways of interpreting it.

00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:25.930
First possible interpretation.

00:32:25.930 --> 00:32:28.740
All we're looking
at here is culture.

00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:31.680
Culture that decides
that menstruation

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:35.800
is a state that you are
unhygienic and need to be

00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:37.440
separated from everybody else.

00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:40.350
And great novels about
red tents and sort

00:32:40.350 --> 00:32:41.790
of cultural values on it.

00:32:41.790 --> 00:32:44.250
So, of course, behavior
changes dramatically

00:32:44.250 --> 00:32:46.060
at that time with a
peripheralization,

00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:50.860
a stigmatization in culture
after culture blah, blah.

00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:52.820
Cross-cultural argument.

00:32:52.820 --> 00:32:56.690
Then there's a personality
argument that a lot of people

00:32:56.690 --> 00:32:57.190
do.

00:32:57.190 --> 00:32:59.330
Looking at the literature,
the relationship between

00:32:59.330 --> 00:33:02.560
increased aggressiveness around
the perimenstrual period.

00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:04.980
Again, notice I'm not
saying pre-menstrual.

00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:06.820
What the literature
shows is a couple

00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:09.480
of days after just as much
as a couple of days before.

00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:11.090
So perimenstrual.

00:33:11.090 --> 00:33:13.760
Personality differences
explaining that.

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:17.640
Then there are the marvelous
psychodynamic psychoanalysts

00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:19.430
who've been let loose
at that for years.

00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:21.080
And what they come
up with-- this

00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:23.830
is one of the great
ridiculous sound bytes.

00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:27.030
That aggression goes up and
women around the time they

00:33:27.030 --> 00:33:29.650
are menstruating
because this evidence

00:33:29.650 --> 00:33:32.960
that they are fertile but
have gone another cycle

00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:36.670
without getting pregnant
throws them into the conflict--

00:33:36.670 --> 00:33:38.746
the conflict between-- get this.

00:33:38.746 --> 00:33:40.620
This could go on like
a doily in the kitchen.

00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:45.680
The conflict between being
productive and reproductive.

00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:49.120
Oh, should I function in society
or should I be off having

00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:50.990
babies like female hyenas?

00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:52.900
And, oh, that's what it's about.

00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:56.140
It's the deep psychoanalytic
conflict and evidence

00:33:56.140 --> 00:33:58.340
that yet again you have
passed up the chance

00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:00.850
to be a mother and
reproductive so you're

00:34:00.850 --> 00:34:02.260
going to be in a pissy mood.

00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:02.780
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:04.920
So that's a more
psychodynamic theory.

00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:08.639
And that one has been around
in the literature forever.

00:34:08.639 --> 00:34:10.820
But back to the biological one.

00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:11.980
Biological one.

00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:16.429
So what sort of evidence
is it for for that?

00:34:16.429 --> 00:34:17.960
So what we got here?

00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:22.170
Let's switch from our
deal from previously.

00:34:22.170 --> 00:34:25.080
So now we've got
menstruation, day 28 coming

00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:26.290
right in the middle there.

00:34:26.290 --> 00:34:28.489
And let us look at this record.

00:34:28.489 --> 00:34:32.844
Here is a female, someone
who you've been observing.

00:34:32.844 --> 00:34:35.260
And you've been observing, in
fact, for a couple of years.

00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:38.940
And you keep track of any time
they do something aggressive.

00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:42.920
And what you see after you've
got 20 cycles worth of data

00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:48.380
is the likelihood of it
occurring does something

00:34:48.380 --> 00:34:50.770
like that.

00:34:50.770 --> 00:34:53.500
That's the perimenstrual
irritability.

00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:56.000
That's a disproportionate
share of women

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.910
in prison for violent acts.

00:34:57.910 --> 00:34:59.150
That's all of that.

00:34:59.150 --> 00:35:01.190
So what do you make
of it when told

00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:03.510
that this is precisely
the profile you

00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:06.880
see in a female baboon?

00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:09.780
Well, she's probably
not getting bummed out

00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:12.330
every time she menstruates
and wonders whether she really

00:35:12.330 --> 00:35:13.970
should be holding
off having babies

00:35:13.970 --> 00:35:16.240
until she gets to be a
partner in the law firm.

00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:18.960
What you see there is none
of the cultural stuff,

00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:20.640
none of the
pyschodynamic, and none

00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:22.320
of the psychosomatic stuff.

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:24.160
Another realm of explanation.

00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:27.200
You see something close
to the same exact thing

00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:29.730
in female baboons.

00:35:29.730 --> 00:35:31.960
So that, and for
my money, argues

00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:36.700
that there is some major biology
going on there amid possibly

00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:38.510
relevant cultural factors.

00:35:38.510 --> 00:35:41.170
Possibly relevant in
terms of there always

00:35:41.170 --> 00:35:43.730
being an argument in a certain
school of anthropologists

00:35:43.730 --> 00:35:46.010
for some decades
that you don't see

00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:49.670
perimenstrual shifts
in behavior in cultures

00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:54.260
that are more free about bodies
and more sexually uninhibited.

00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:57.480
And presumably this
tells you that something

00:35:57.480 --> 00:35:59.452
about baboons'
sexual inhibitions,

00:35:59.452 --> 00:36:00.910
there's not a whole
lot of evidence

00:36:00.910 --> 00:36:03.480
for that perimenstrual
mood shifts is

00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:06.020
pretty universal
across human cultures.

00:36:06.020 --> 00:36:10.050
And you see the same exact
thing in a female baboon.

00:36:10.050 --> 00:36:14.670
So we've got some biology
going on there for my money.

00:36:14.670 --> 00:36:17.860
None the less, you
don't have only biology

00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:21.360
because there are all sorts
of psychological factors.

00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:24.210
One study showing
things, for example,

00:36:24.210 --> 00:36:28.560
like if you tell a woman that
she is one day before having

00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:29.490
her period.

00:36:29.490 --> 00:36:31.760
And I'm not exactly
sure how this one

00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:34.260
works, let alone the human
subject's permission.

00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:36.930
But this was a study
done some decades ago.

00:36:36.930 --> 00:36:40.530
Women become more irritable.

00:36:40.530 --> 00:36:42.770
So a self-fulfilling component.

00:36:42.770 --> 00:36:46.780
Tell someone that
they are going to have

00:36:46.780 --> 00:36:50.460
their period the next day and
their male significant other

00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:51.565
becomes more irritable.

00:36:51.565 --> 00:36:52.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:52.750 --> 00:36:57.180
Irritability among men who
have significant others, women,

00:36:57.180 --> 00:37:01.420
peaks around the time that
she as menstru-- whoa,

00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:05.940
we've got either some sort of
viral, infectious, intersexual

00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:09.600
thing happening here or we've
got strong components having

00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:11.860
nothing to do with the biology.

00:37:11.860 --> 00:37:14.920
This one, in addition,
studies showing that, yes,

00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:16.940
there is this mood fluctuation.

00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:20.460
On the average there is a
larger fluctuation in mood,

00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:23.790
affect, when you compare
weekend versus week

00:37:23.790 --> 00:37:27.090
day, in particular Friday,
Saturday versus Monday,

00:37:27.090 --> 00:37:27.810
Tuesday.

00:37:27.810 --> 00:37:30.220
Bigger fluctuation
than the mood changes

00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:32.770
you see typically in
women around the time

00:37:32.770 --> 00:37:33.830
of their period.

00:37:33.830 --> 00:37:37.020
So we got some biology here,
but nonetheless there's

00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:39.500
other stuff going on as well.

00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:40.860
So what about the biology?

00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:42.440
One thing that
immediately comes up

00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:45.730
is this issue that, OK,
perimenstrual periods,

00:37:45.730 --> 00:37:49.800
mood shifts there, are not
purely about aggression

00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:51.320
and irritability.

00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:55.000
They are also about depression
and social withdrawal.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:56.910
That's the time of
cycle when women

00:37:56.910 --> 00:38:00.110
are most likely to have
a depressive episode.

00:38:00.110 --> 00:38:02.660
Very, very different
scenario there.

00:38:02.660 --> 00:38:03.800
So what's up with that?

00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:07.460
You begin to get a hint of
this looking at the baboons.

00:38:07.460 --> 00:38:10.300
What you see is
this is the profile

00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:14.400
you would see in a high
ranking female baboon.

00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:18.640
Look at a low ranking female and
there's no particular change.

00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:21.360
Look instead at a
measure of how far

00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:23.650
away she stays
from everyone else

00:38:23.650 --> 00:38:25.680
and it does something like that.

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:28.710
In other words, if you are
a low ranking female baboon,

00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:32.050
you don't have the option to
be irritable to somebody else

00:38:32.050 --> 00:38:33.270
and dump on them.

00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:37.400
You instead become more socially
withdrawn, do less grooming.

00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:41.300
So an interaction between
place and society, all of that.

00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:43.060
So the biology now.

00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:45.380
Estrogen, progesterone.

00:38:45.380 --> 00:38:48.000
Lots of evidence
that their levels

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.570
and in particular their
ratio is critical to what

00:38:51.570 --> 00:38:52.780
is going on here.

00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:55.010
Massive changes in
the levels of both

00:38:55.010 --> 00:38:58.050
of these hormones around
the time of one's period.

00:38:58.050 --> 00:39:00.655
And does not take a
whole lot for the ratios

00:39:00.655 --> 00:39:03.510
thus to become
very, very skewed.

00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:06.130
Back to the advanced
endocrinology stuff,

00:39:06.130 --> 00:39:07.550
the fact that
parts of your brain

00:39:07.550 --> 00:39:08.930
are not just
measuring the levels

00:39:08.930 --> 00:39:12.240
of one hormone or another,
but the ratio of the two.

00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:14.060
That seems to be pertinent.

00:39:14.060 --> 00:39:16.870
What the evidence
suggests is in one subset

00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:19.900
of women with severe
perimenstrual syndrome--

00:39:19.900 --> 00:39:22.220
and that's about 10%
of the population.

00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:25.190
In one subset of those
individuals what seems to be

00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:29.090
the problem is too much
of a drop of progesterone

00:39:29.090 --> 00:39:32.780
around the time of your period.

00:39:32.780 --> 00:39:35.650
So what's the
neurochemistry of that?

00:39:35.650 --> 00:39:37.800
Quick memory from
a few weeks ago.

00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:42.162
What's one of the unlikely
things that progesterone does?

00:39:42.162 --> 00:39:44.140
[INAUDIBLE]

00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:44.760
Yeah.

00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:46.350
The GABA receptor stuff.

00:39:46.350 --> 00:39:50.450
Progesterone-- by way of often
this metabolite, this sort

00:39:50.450 --> 00:39:52.770
of breakdown product
of it-- progesterone

00:39:52.770 --> 00:39:56.040
being able to bind to
the receptor for GABA

00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:59.280
at a minor tranquilizer
binding site

00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:03.780
just like where benzodiazepines
like Valium bind to.

00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:06.910
Progesterone as
decreasing anxiety,

00:40:06.910 --> 00:40:10.110
progesterone as mildly sedative.

00:40:10.110 --> 00:40:11.940
That's one of the
interpretations that's

00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:13.950
given for what a
more than normally

00:40:13.950 --> 00:40:18.030
rapid drop of progesterone
might have to do with PMS.

00:40:18.030 --> 00:40:20.810
Another subgroup of
women appear to have

00:40:20.810 --> 00:40:23.030
an atypically large
drop in levels

00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:28.290
of opioids, endogenous
opioids, around the time here.

00:40:28.290 --> 00:40:31.490
Normally there are
levels of beta endorphin,

00:40:31.490 --> 00:40:35.000
a neurotransmitter slash
hormone with all sorts

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:39.270
of nice effects on mood
and things of that sort.

00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:42.460
And levels tend to go
down around this point.

00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:46.200
A subset of women with severe
PMS where the marker there

00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:49.030
appears to be a
particularly fast drop

00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:52.030
of opioid beta endorphin
levels at the time.

00:40:52.030 --> 00:40:55.390
So just the first bits of
hints of the endocrinology

00:40:55.390 --> 00:40:57.500
of what that is about.

00:40:57.500 --> 00:40:58.900
Final hormones.

00:40:58.900 --> 00:41:03.580
Final hormones, glucocorticoids,
epinephrine, norepinephrine,

00:41:03.580 --> 00:41:05.870
glucocorticoids,
sympathetic nervous system.

00:41:05.870 --> 00:41:09.050
And it's the same exact
deal as two days ago.

00:41:09.050 --> 00:41:11.650
Looking at the fact
that those midbrain,

00:41:11.650 --> 00:41:15.117
hindbrain areas get activated
during an aggressive act.

00:41:15.117 --> 00:41:17.200
Oh, does that teach us
something about aggression?

00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:18.620
Not in the slightest.

00:41:18.620 --> 00:41:21.350
What you have instead
is the nonspecificity.

00:41:21.350 --> 00:41:24.920
Levels of glucocorticoids
will go up roughly equally

00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:27.830
whether you were running for
your life or running in rage

00:41:27.830 --> 00:41:29.110
or running in joy.

00:41:29.110 --> 00:41:32.020
That whole deal again,
sympathetic arousal.

00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:33.340
It's nonspecific.

00:41:33.340 --> 00:41:35.960
And back to that sound
byte from two days ago,

00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:38.220
the opposite of
love is not hate.

00:41:38.220 --> 00:41:41.250
The opposite of love
is indifference.

00:41:41.250 --> 00:41:45.120
And endocrinologically,
this is the case again.

00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:48.350
One interesting piece in the
glucocorticoid and sympathetic

00:41:48.350 --> 00:41:50.010
nervous system domain.

00:41:50.010 --> 00:41:53.820
Take somebody and poke
their finger with a pin

00:41:53.820 --> 00:41:56.460
or make them physically
uncomfortable

00:41:56.460 --> 00:41:58.960
or something painful
and they activate

00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:03.041
the sympathetic nervous system
as part of their mild stress

00:42:03.041 --> 00:42:03.540
response.

00:42:03.540 --> 00:42:05.140
The early stages of it.

00:42:05.140 --> 00:42:08.920
One class of people where this
doesn't work anywhere near

00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:11.340
as much-- sociopaths.

00:42:11.340 --> 00:42:14.890
And by now a large literature
showing elevated pain

00:42:14.890 --> 00:42:19.260
thresholds in people with
sociopathic violent disorders

00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:21.940
of behavior, elevated
pain thresholds

00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:26.600
and less sympathetic nervous
system responsiveness to pain.

00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:29.230
And you should be able to
go off and running with that

00:42:29.230 --> 00:42:32.430
one easily in so far
as metaphorically

00:42:32.430 --> 00:42:36.040
what empathy is about, is
feeling somebody else's pain.

00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:39.540
If your own pain system is on
the pretty insensitive side,

00:42:39.540 --> 00:42:41.980
that is certainly going
to have an impact there.

00:42:41.980 --> 00:42:45.010
That's a very
consistent finding.

00:42:45.010 --> 00:42:47.360
So what we are ready for
now is switching over

00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:51.300
to longer term environmental
ideas about aggression.

00:42:51.300 --> 00:42:54.231
Why do I keep pretending
as if the chart is here?

00:42:54.231 --> 00:42:54.730
Here.

00:42:54.730 --> 00:42:56.360
We've now moved over to here.

00:42:56.360 --> 00:42:58.890
Shifting from
environmental triggers--

00:42:58.890 --> 00:43:01.840
not something painful
five seconds ago,

00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:04.780
not I was expecting you get
this food pellet after pressing

00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:08.140
the lever 20 times and I didn't
get the lever, I'm frustrated.

00:43:08.140 --> 00:43:11.410
Not a minute's worth of
environmental releasers.

00:43:11.410 --> 00:43:15.620
But instead general
pictures of what environment

00:43:15.620 --> 00:43:17.010
has to do with aggression.

00:43:17.010 --> 00:43:21.019
Some of the broad theories that
have come out over the years.

00:43:21.019 --> 00:43:22.810
Let's take a five minute
break before that.

00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:28.580
To quickly go through
this deal again.

00:43:28.580 --> 00:43:32.005
So you've got amino
acid precursor.

00:43:32.005 --> 00:43:36.160
Tryptophan, that's your building
block for making serotonin.

00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:39.610
Key enzyme coded for by a gene.

00:43:39.610 --> 00:43:40.690
It's a protein.

00:43:40.690 --> 00:43:43.410
Key enzyme that turns
it into the first step.

00:43:43.410 --> 00:43:44.404
And then this enzyme.

00:43:44.404 --> 00:43:45.570
There's always a ton around.

00:43:45.570 --> 00:43:48.140
It automatically gets
turned into serotonin.

00:43:48.140 --> 00:43:49.750
So now you have serotonin.

00:43:49.750 --> 00:43:53.700
Serotonin will do its thing
by way of binding to serotonin

00:43:53.700 --> 00:43:54.720
receptors.

00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:57.730
And at some point serotonin
tone will be broken down

00:43:57.730 --> 00:43:59.870
into this waste product.

00:43:59.870 --> 00:44:02.680
So a gene coding
for this protein,

00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:05.970
a gene coding for this one,
which we're not interested in.

00:44:05.970 --> 00:44:09.150
A bunch of genes coding
for the receptors.

00:44:09.150 --> 00:44:11.880
And genes coding for
these two enzymes.

00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:13.860
And the whole point
there being that there's

00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:16.540
different versions
of these genes

00:44:16.540 --> 00:44:20.290
for the synthetic enzymes,
for the degradative enzymes,

00:44:20.290 --> 00:44:21.560
for the receptors.

00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:24.250
And thus beginning to
look at whether that

00:44:24.250 --> 00:44:28.120
predicts differences in
levels of aggressive behavior.

00:44:28.120 --> 00:44:30.340
So that's what that was about.

00:44:30.340 --> 00:44:33.950
In addition, was just told
a great story about somebody

00:44:33.950 --> 00:44:37.090
who was under tremendous
duress to supply

00:44:37.090 --> 00:44:40.700
alcohol for her younger
16-year-old sister

00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:44.330
and friends at a sweet
16 party and decided,

00:44:44.330 --> 00:44:46.010
no way is this happening.

00:44:46.010 --> 00:44:49.170
And thus bought a bunch of
bottles of something or other

00:44:49.170 --> 00:44:51.890
and took the labels off
and put other labels on.

00:44:51.890 --> 00:44:53.960
And before you knew it,
you had a whole bunch

00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:57.350
of 16-year-olds
acting just asinine

00:44:57.350 --> 00:44:59.580
and claiming to be
drunk beyond words.

00:44:59.580 --> 00:45:00.890
And, yes.

00:45:00.890 --> 00:45:02.360
Social modulation of.

00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:03.110
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:03.110 --> 00:45:05.100
Very, very frequently seen.

00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:08.620
And hopefully some of you
have taken part in experiments

00:45:08.620 --> 00:45:10.360
like that yourselves
over the years

00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:14.110
or may foist that one
off on someone else.

00:45:14.110 --> 00:45:17.820
So now pushing over toward
some of the broad theories

00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:20.960
about environmental
triggers for aggression.

00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:24.220
And no surprise, theories
are a dime a dozen.

00:45:24.220 --> 00:45:26.560
All sorts of theorists
over the years.

00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:29.630
And some of which occasionally
feel obliged to actually go

00:45:29.630 --> 00:45:31.350
see if there's
data supporting it.

00:45:31.350 --> 00:45:32.850
But what I'll just
touch on briefly

00:45:32.850 --> 00:45:35.970
are three very broadly
different schools

00:45:35.970 --> 00:45:39.700
of thinking about environmental
factors in aggression.

00:45:39.700 --> 00:45:43.460
The first school is one that
says environment is irrelevant.

00:45:43.460 --> 00:45:45.640
And you can bet how much
I'm going to like that here

00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:46.710
in the coming minutes.

00:45:46.710 --> 00:45:49.170
And who was the main
advocate of that?

00:45:49.170 --> 00:45:53.670
Our ever reliable friend
Herr Nazi Konrad Lorenz.

00:45:53.670 --> 00:45:57.400
Konrad Lorenz, after he had
gotten out of his prison camp

00:45:57.400 --> 00:45:59.980
after World War II for
being a Nazi propagandist

00:45:59.980 --> 00:46:03.060
and he sort of dusted himself
off and got his ethology

00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:05.740
empire going again
and remarkably

00:46:05.740 --> 00:46:09.750
was forgiven by the other
elder fathers of ethology,

00:46:09.750 --> 00:46:12.790
including Niko Tinbergen,
who spent much of World War

00:46:12.790 --> 00:46:14.560
II in a concentration
camp and he

00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:16.740
is the one who led
the move to make sure

00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:19.950
that Konrad Lorenz was
welcomed back in the community

00:46:19.950 --> 00:46:22.290
even though he was an
unrepentant Nazi swine.

00:46:22.290 --> 00:46:25.440
But-- so after Konrad
Lorenz came out,

00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:27.560
in the early '60s he
wrote a book which

00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:32.070
was one of the most influential
anthropology books of all time,

00:46:32.070 --> 00:46:34.520
a book called On Aggression.

00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:38.430
And that was the coffee
table book for half a decade.

00:46:38.430 --> 00:46:41.890
That was the book that people
had book clubs about if they

00:46:41.890 --> 00:46:42.990
were intellectuals.

00:46:42.990 --> 00:46:46.920
On Aggression had a huge
influence on people's thinking

00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:48.450
at the time.

00:46:48.450 --> 00:46:51.300
And what was the Lorenz's
basic premise as to

00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:53.940
what were the environmental
components of aggression?

00:46:53.940 --> 00:46:55.300
What was aggression about?

00:46:55.300 --> 00:46:57.130
It was exactly
the book you would

00:46:57.130 --> 00:47:00.230
expect to be written
by an unrepentant Nazi.

00:47:00.230 --> 00:47:05.590
Because his theme was just
following biological orders.

00:47:05.590 --> 00:47:09.540
In Lorenz's view, on his view
as to what aggression is about,

00:47:09.540 --> 00:47:11.190
it is inevitable.

00:47:11.190 --> 00:47:13.880
There is no environmental
requirement.

00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:17.240
Aggression is universal
and inevitable.

00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:20.080
Famous quote of his that
he gave, for example,

00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:23.060
near his death in the
1970s to Newsweek.

00:47:23.060 --> 00:47:25.800
There is no love without hate.

00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:26.530
Wow.

00:47:26.530 --> 00:47:28.021
He must have been
a great father.

00:47:28.021 --> 00:47:28.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:32.390
But what you see is a whole
book, a whole premise,

00:47:32.390 --> 00:47:33.030
built on that.

00:47:33.030 --> 00:47:35.290
A number of the notions,
the basic themes

00:47:35.290 --> 00:47:36.840
that ran through the book.

00:47:36.840 --> 00:47:40.450
Number one, aggression
is universal.

00:47:40.450 --> 00:47:43.440
It is there in all individuals.

00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:47.990
Number two, what he called his
hydraulic model of aggression.

00:47:47.990 --> 00:47:50.090
And if this sounds silly,
you should actually

00:47:50.090 --> 00:47:53.850
go see the book because he had
actual diagrams of like pseudo

00:47:53.850 --> 00:47:57.220
toilet bowl plumbing stuff
telling us how aggression

00:47:57.220 --> 00:47:58.880
works as follows.

00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:04.190
There is some aggression toilet
bowl water tank which is slowly

00:48:04.190 --> 00:48:06.030
filling up with water.

00:48:06.030 --> 00:48:09.360
And the deal is that the
higher the levels of water get,

00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:12.520
the higher the aggressive
drive, the less

00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:16.940
of an environmental trigger it
takes to provoke the aggression

00:48:16.940 --> 00:48:18.560
to come out.

00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:22.040
The higher the levels,
the more easily

00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:24.580
a releasing stimulus
will trigger fixed action

00:48:24.580 --> 00:48:26.280
pattern of aggression.

00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:29.320
Intrinsic in his model
also and explicitly stated

00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:34.240
was eventually his toilet bowl
fills up with enough-- actually

00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:35.990
it's not the toilet
bowl, it's the tank.

00:48:35.990 --> 00:48:37.730
The tank fills up
with enough water

00:48:37.730 --> 00:48:40.180
that it begins to
dribble over the top

00:48:40.180 --> 00:48:43.500
and thus you get
spontaneous aggression.

00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:46.440
His model was with
the passage of time,

00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:50.460
the longer It has been since an
organism has been aggressive,

00:48:50.460 --> 00:48:52.620
the less of an
environmental releaser

00:48:52.620 --> 00:48:55.530
is needed to provoke
the aggression until it

00:48:55.530 --> 00:48:57.940
is ultimately spontaneous.

00:48:57.940 --> 00:49:02.080
The third piece of his model
was just like a toilet bowl

00:49:02.080 --> 00:49:05.610
again, which is when you have
an aggressive act you've just

00:49:05.610 --> 00:49:07.190
emptied out the tank.

00:49:07.190 --> 00:49:10.190
You deplete the
aggressive drive.

00:49:10.190 --> 00:49:13.440
You deplete it so that
it resets the system,

00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:15.510
starting a refractory period.

00:49:15.510 --> 00:49:18.080
That aggression
decreases the likelihood

00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:20.510
of aggression occurring
immediately afterward.

00:49:20.510 --> 00:49:22.240
This was the
Lorentzian model, which

00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:25.270
was enormously,
enormously influential

00:49:25.270 --> 00:49:27.420
and everybody learned
about this in Intro Anthro

00:49:27.420 --> 00:49:30.470
through the 1960s. '60s
And it would take you

00:49:30.470 --> 00:49:33.650
about two seconds
to shred this one.

00:49:33.650 --> 00:49:36.120
How many of you have
ever murdered anyone?

00:49:39.330 --> 00:49:39.980
You never know.

00:49:39.980 --> 00:49:41.980
People are kind of drowsy,
checking their emails

00:49:41.980 --> 00:49:43.220
and suddenly confess.

00:49:43.220 --> 00:49:45.940
How many of you plan
to murder somebody?

00:49:45.940 --> 00:49:48.930
Yes, we are like the most
dangerous aggressively species

00:49:48.930 --> 00:49:51.630
on this planet and the
vast majority of us

00:49:51.630 --> 00:49:53.970
will never have a physical
fight with somebody

00:49:53.970 --> 00:49:56.180
since we left
seventh grade or so.

00:49:56.180 --> 00:49:58.410
Aggression is not universal.

00:49:58.410 --> 00:50:00.720
Aggression is not inevitable.

00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:05.350
And aggression is not sublimated
into psychological processes,

00:50:05.350 --> 00:50:08.090
which thus can pass as
support for this model.

00:50:08.090 --> 00:50:10.690
The final thing that
does it in is aggression

00:50:10.690 --> 00:50:12.870
is not self-depleting.

00:50:12.870 --> 00:50:15.530
Aggression is self-reinforcing.

00:50:15.530 --> 00:50:18.110
And all you have to do
is look at the crowd

00:50:18.110 --> 00:50:20.300
contagion, the
emotional contagion,

00:50:20.300 --> 00:50:24.020
that occurs in soccer stadiums
when people start fighting.

00:50:24.020 --> 00:50:25.920
Crowd violence, all of that.

00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:29.850
Aggression is not self-depleting
and resetting the clock.

00:50:29.850 --> 00:50:32.660
Aggression stimulates
more aggression.

00:50:32.660 --> 00:50:35.110
Aggression legitimatizes it.

00:50:35.110 --> 00:50:37.160
It habituates you to it it.

00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:39.620
Is not fitting
Lorenz's model at all.

00:50:39.620 --> 00:50:41.830
Meanwhile, on the
other end of the block,

00:50:41.830 --> 00:50:44.240
was a very, very
different sort of view.

00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:47.210
And this is one that permeates
a lot of thinking in the field.

00:50:47.210 --> 00:50:49.300
And this is one built
around the notion

00:50:49.300 --> 00:50:53.310
that aggression is ultimately
all about frustration.

00:50:53.310 --> 00:50:59.600
It is about frustration,
pain, stress, fear, anxiety.

00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:01.660
And this was a view
very heavily pushed

00:51:01.660 --> 00:51:05.210
by Soviet researchers in the
period of the Soviet Union.

00:51:05.210 --> 00:51:07.670
A very Marxist view
because essentially

00:51:07.670 --> 00:51:09.820
what you conclude at
the end is this theme

00:51:09.820 --> 00:51:12.090
I keep bringing up
every time pointing out

00:51:12.090 --> 00:51:15.470
that the amygdala has something
to do with both aggression

00:51:15.470 --> 00:51:16.580
and fear.

00:51:16.580 --> 00:51:19.250
That in a world in which
no amygdaloid neuron

00:51:19.250 --> 00:51:21.810
need have an action
potential out of fear,

00:51:21.810 --> 00:51:23.500
there's not going
to be aggression.

00:51:23.500 --> 00:51:27.490
So this is the extreme version
of the frustration displacement

00:51:27.490 --> 00:51:28.180
model.

00:51:28.180 --> 00:51:31.770
And what is emphasized
in that is a lot of data.

00:51:31.770 --> 00:51:36.590
You look at, for example, when
levels of unemployment go up,

00:51:36.590 --> 00:51:40.330
levels of spousal abuse go up,
levels of child abuse go up.

00:51:40.330 --> 00:51:43.860
When the economy gets
bad, the same exact thing.

00:51:43.860 --> 00:51:45.200
Laboratory animals.

00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:47.810
Shock a rat, it will bite
the one sitting next to it.

00:51:47.810 --> 00:51:51.450
All of these versions of
displacement aggression.

00:51:51.450 --> 00:51:56.030
In a baboon troop, for example,
almost 50% of aggression

00:51:56.030 --> 00:52:00.020
is displacement aggression
after somebody loses a fight

00:52:00.020 --> 00:52:02.340
or loses access to a resource.

00:52:02.340 --> 00:52:04.980
Almost certainly this
begins to explain

00:52:04.980 --> 00:52:09.780
two really, really depressing
things about unequal societies.

00:52:09.780 --> 00:52:13.940
First one being that the
poorer you are, the more likely

00:52:13.940 --> 00:52:16.140
you are to be violent,
the more likely

00:52:16.140 --> 00:52:18.810
you are to commit some
sort of criminal violence.

00:52:18.810 --> 00:52:21.690
And when the economy gets bad,
the rates of that get worse.

00:52:21.690 --> 00:52:22.880
It gets more skewed.

00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:25.380
And the other ironic
piece of all of that

00:52:25.380 --> 00:52:32.060
is that when crime goes up in
lower socioeconomic strata,

00:52:32.060 --> 00:52:36.160
overwhelmingly it is crime
turned on the other poor.

00:52:36.160 --> 00:52:38.690
When crime goes
up during periods

00:52:38.690 --> 00:52:42.840
of frustration and mistreatment
of lower socioeconomic classes,

00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:45.900
it does not take the form
of suddenly everybody going

00:52:45.900 --> 00:52:48.930
and deciding to like scale
the wall to the palace there

00:52:48.930 --> 00:52:51.300
and rip off some
of the Ming vases.

00:52:51.300 --> 00:52:54.130
It is victimizing the
people who are victims

00:52:54.130 --> 00:52:55.600
right next door to you.

00:52:55.600 --> 00:52:57.930
During times of
economic downturns,

00:52:57.930 --> 00:53:00.810
the rates of crime in
poorer neighborhoods go up

00:53:00.810 --> 00:53:03.640
and it's almost always
turned on individuals

00:53:03.640 --> 00:53:04.900
in the neighborhood.

00:53:04.900 --> 00:53:07.510
So that supports
this picture as well.

00:53:07.510 --> 00:53:10.980
One interesting thing that
argues against frustration

00:53:10.980 --> 00:53:12.390
displacement models.

00:53:12.390 --> 00:53:13.950
And this is looking at animals.

00:53:13.950 --> 00:53:17.140
And looking at what happens
to levels of aggression

00:53:17.140 --> 00:53:19.430
during periods of famine.

00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:22.400
And this has been studied in a
surprising number of species.

00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:26.600
And what you've got are two
very opposing predictions.

00:53:26.600 --> 00:53:30.720
First one is if what aggression
is about is built out

00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:36.480
of frustration, need pain, fear,
hunger, things of that sort,

00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:40.040
the prediction would be when you
look at populations of animals

00:53:40.040 --> 00:53:42.350
during periods of
famine, aggression

00:53:42.350 --> 00:53:45.370
should go up over
food resources.

00:53:45.370 --> 00:53:46.960
And this comes
with the qualifier

00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:49.730
that these studies have
to be during a period when

00:53:49.730 --> 00:53:52.000
animals are having
to work harder

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:54.040
to get the normal
amounts of food

00:53:54.040 --> 00:53:56.760
rather than that they are
being calorically deprived

00:53:56.760 --> 00:53:59.140
because obviously behavior
is going to be changed then.

00:53:59.140 --> 00:54:00.950
So frustration
displacement model

00:54:00.950 --> 00:54:03.710
predicts that during
periods of famine,

00:54:03.710 --> 00:54:07.180
aggression goes up
in social species.

00:54:07.180 --> 00:54:10.380
A very different model would
predict exactly the opposite.

00:54:10.380 --> 00:54:12.430
And what the bulk of
the literature has shown

00:54:12.430 --> 00:54:17.240
is during periods of famine in
wild animals in social groups,

00:54:17.240 --> 00:54:20.700
aggression tends to go
down rather than up.

00:54:20.700 --> 00:54:22.600
So at least in that
realm that tends

00:54:22.600 --> 00:54:26.480
to be a vote against one
particular type of frustration

00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:28.130
displacement aggression.

00:54:28.130 --> 00:54:29.310
It tends to go down.

00:54:29.310 --> 00:54:31.850
And in fact, the term has
been given for that by people

00:54:31.850 --> 00:54:33.150
who think about these things.

00:54:33.150 --> 00:54:36.200
It's referred to
as behavioral fat.

00:54:36.200 --> 00:54:40.580
Why does aggression go up, for
example, among young male lions

00:54:40.580 --> 00:54:43.110
not during the periods of
the year when there is not

00:54:43.110 --> 00:54:46.610
much food but during the peak
of, say, zebra migration?

00:54:46.610 --> 00:54:48.040
What's going on there?

00:54:48.040 --> 00:54:48.860
You've got a lion.

00:54:48.860 --> 00:54:51.190
It's sitting there
saying, I'm not hungry.

00:54:51.190 --> 00:54:52.220
My stomach is full.

00:54:52.220 --> 00:54:53.402
There's nobody to hunt.

00:54:53.402 --> 00:54:55.110
Nobody's going to mate
with me right now,

00:54:55.110 --> 00:54:57.510
so I might as well go get
in a fight with somebody.

00:54:57.510 --> 00:55:00.790
And in that scenario
what aggression is about

00:55:00.790 --> 00:55:05.020
is use of surplus resources
when there is an excess.

00:55:05.020 --> 00:55:06.890
It is behavioral fat.

00:55:06.890 --> 00:55:09.690
And in lots of species
you see aggression

00:55:09.690 --> 00:55:12.430
as a model of behavioral
fat rather than

00:55:12.430 --> 00:55:15.620
purely resource deprivation.

00:55:15.620 --> 00:55:17.430
One interesting
interpretation that I've

00:55:17.430 --> 00:55:20.320
seen of one type of
violence, which is the notion

00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:23.300
that violence,
aggression, competition,

00:55:23.300 --> 00:55:26.800
being built around limited
resources, a very interesting

00:55:26.800 --> 00:55:32.410
interpretation of clan violence,
of feuds, of vendettas,

00:55:32.410 --> 00:55:35.270
of retributive violence, which
has been a large percentage

00:55:35.270 --> 00:55:37.010
of violence over the centuries.

00:55:37.010 --> 00:55:39.670
A way to formalize
that is to think

00:55:39.670 --> 00:55:42.020
that these are two
different clans at war

00:55:42.020 --> 00:55:45.240
with each other competing
for a very, very

00:55:45.240 --> 00:55:48.280
singular resource,
the one who does

00:55:48.280 --> 00:55:50.290
the last bit of retribution.

00:55:50.290 --> 00:55:52.040
That's what they're
competing for.

00:55:52.040 --> 00:55:54.080
So an interesting
interpretation there.

00:55:54.080 --> 00:55:56.230
Third broad branch
of people thinking

00:55:56.230 --> 00:55:58.660
about theorizing about
aggression-- and these are,

00:55:58.660 --> 00:56:00.590
of course, our behaviorists.

00:56:00.590 --> 00:56:03.870
Back to the Watson and
Skinner and give me

00:56:03.870 --> 00:56:05.860
a child of any
background and let

00:56:05.860 --> 00:56:09.774
me control rewards and positive
reinforcement and punishments

00:56:09.774 --> 00:56:11.440
and negative
reinforcement, all of that,

00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:14.580
and I will be able to regulate
any aspect of behavior.

00:56:14.580 --> 00:56:16.530
We know that whole
approach by now.

00:56:16.530 --> 00:56:18.120
We saw all the
ways in which that

00:56:18.120 --> 00:56:22.390
fails in explaining classical
ethologically based behavior.

00:56:22.390 --> 00:56:27.100
But in the standard behaviorist
view have enough opportunities

00:56:27.100 --> 00:56:32.500
for punishment and you can
shape, you can condition away,

00:56:32.500 --> 00:56:35.400
you can eliminate
aggressive behavior.

00:56:35.400 --> 00:56:38.550
And all you need to do
is think for two seconds

00:56:38.550 --> 00:56:42.730
and see that that is very
limited in its applicability.

00:56:42.730 --> 00:56:45.390
Nicely, huge number
of experiments

00:56:45.390 --> 00:56:47.820
have been going on for two
centuries in this country

00:56:47.820 --> 00:56:50.960
looking at that, which is
looking at rates of crime

00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:54.910
as levels of punishment, the
length of jail sentences,

00:56:54.910 --> 00:56:57.110
the likelihood of
being caught, things

00:56:57.110 --> 00:56:59.760
like that as the
punishment likelihood

00:56:59.760 --> 00:57:04.070
and severity changes, does that
change the likelihood of crime?

00:57:04.070 --> 00:57:07.980
Most studied is the very
specific question of,

00:57:07.980 --> 00:57:11.550
does the death penalty
decrease the amount of murders?

00:57:11.550 --> 00:57:14.160
As different states have
eliminated the death penalty,

00:57:14.160 --> 00:57:17.140
as they've reinstated
it, things of that sort,

00:57:17.140 --> 00:57:21.050
does changing your behaviorist
realm of punishment

00:57:21.050 --> 00:57:23.000
that you could get
for killing someone,

00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:27.020
does that decrease the
incidence of murders?

00:57:27.020 --> 00:57:31.040
And what you wind up seeing
is in some cases, yes.

00:57:31.040 --> 00:57:32.060
Absolutely.

00:57:32.060 --> 00:57:33.960
When you are looking
at murders that

00:57:33.960 --> 00:57:36.430
involve premeditated violence.

00:57:36.430 --> 00:57:38.580
When it is someone
who is sitting there

00:57:38.580 --> 00:57:40.620
for months planning
how to do this,

00:57:40.620 --> 00:57:43.610
when somebody who is
hired to kill somebody.

00:57:43.610 --> 00:57:44.710
Things of that sort.

00:57:44.710 --> 00:57:47.670
When it is planned in advance,
increased the likelihood

00:57:47.670 --> 00:57:50.830
of death penalty does indeed
decrease the likelihood

00:57:50.830 --> 00:57:52.820
of premeditated murder.

00:57:52.820 --> 00:57:58.010
However, it does not touch for a
second impulsive murder, crimes

00:57:58.010 --> 00:57:59.660
of passion, things of that sort.

00:57:59.660 --> 00:58:01.040
And that makes perfect sense.

00:58:01.040 --> 00:58:04.560
There is no person who has
just been insulted in a bar

00:58:04.560 --> 00:58:07.160
and pulls out a gun
who stops for a second

00:58:07.160 --> 00:58:08.520
and thinks, wait a second.

00:58:08.520 --> 00:58:11.880
Did the state legislature
pass that new law last week?

00:58:11.880 --> 00:58:13.030
Let me think about it.

00:58:13.030 --> 00:58:15.510
They don't think about that
because they don't think.

00:58:15.510 --> 00:58:20.230
And the majority of violence in
that realm is unpremeditated.

00:58:20.230 --> 00:58:22.250
Mostly what the
studies have shown

00:58:22.250 --> 00:58:25.440
is changing the
severity of punishment

00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:29.350
for murder does not particularly
change the murder rates.

00:58:29.350 --> 00:58:32.810
So these broad different
sorts of views-- aggression

00:58:32.810 --> 00:58:36.860
as inevitable, biologically
inevitable, all environment can

00:58:36.860 --> 00:58:39.170
do is shape the frequency a bit.

00:58:39.170 --> 00:58:43.970
Aggression as solely a product
of fear, frustration, anxiety,

00:58:43.970 --> 00:58:45.710
resource deprivation.

00:58:45.710 --> 00:58:48.540
Aggression solely as
a set of behaviors

00:58:48.540 --> 00:58:51.170
that could be shaped by
reward and punishment

00:58:51.170 --> 00:58:52.830
to the point of going away.

00:58:52.830 --> 00:58:54.820
What do you actually
see when you

00:58:54.820 --> 00:58:57.740
see some aspects of
environmental impacts

00:58:57.740 --> 00:58:58.630
on aggression?

00:58:58.630 --> 00:59:01.120
Particularly early in life.

00:59:01.120 --> 00:59:03.070
What do you wind
up seeing in terms

00:59:03.070 --> 00:59:05.730
of learning to be aggressive?

00:59:05.730 --> 00:59:08.060
The theme that comes
through over and over again,

00:59:08.060 --> 00:59:10.470
as I've referred
to, is the notion

00:59:10.470 --> 00:59:12.900
that a lot of what early
experience is about

00:59:12.900 --> 00:59:15.240
is not learning how
to be aggressive,

00:59:15.240 --> 00:59:17.450
but learning when
to be aggressive.

00:59:17.450 --> 00:59:19.790
The appropriate context for it.

00:59:19.790 --> 00:59:20.630
Whoa.

00:59:20.630 --> 00:59:21.789
My page has disappeared.

00:59:21.789 --> 00:59:23.455
No wonder it seemed
to have just jumped.

00:59:26.070 --> 00:59:29.990
Let's just do that
for a moment here.

00:59:29.990 --> 00:59:32.780
Oh, that's what we're
talking about next.

00:59:32.780 --> 00:59:34.540
So let's get rid of that.

00:59:34.540 --> 00:59:37.120
So what that ushers
us into, I say,

00:59:37.120 --> 00:59:40.330
trying to make it seem as if
that's a seamless transition--

00:59:40.330 --> 00:59:42.357
what, OK.

00:59:42.357 --> 00:59:43.940
Let's all sing for
a couple of minutes

00:59:43.940 --> 00:59:45.220
here while I look at
this piece of paper.

00:59:45.220 --> 00:59:45.820
[LAUGHTER]

00:59:45.820 --> 00:59:48.000
So what this now
brings up is, what

00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:50.860
does early experience--
in terms of environment,

00:59:50.860 --> 00:59:52.810
in terms of upbringing--
what does that

00:59:52.810 --> 00:59:56.290
have to do with aggressive
behavior, empathy, compassion,

00:59:56.290 --> 00:59:58.430
all the things we
are looking at here?

00:59:58.430 --> 01:00:00.860
Because never more
than during development

01:00:00.860 --> 01:00:04.210
do these themes of is
aggression inevitable,

01:00:04.210 --> 01:00:06.640
is aggression purely
about social learning,

01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:09.160
is aggression purely
about displacement--

01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:13.260
never more is it clearer in
terms of the consequences

01:00:13.260 --> 01:00:15.340
than during early development.

01:00:15.340 --> 01:00:18.270
So what's the transition
during development

01:00:18.270 --> 01:00:21.040
towards the development
of aggression,

01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:23.780
the development of
empathy, the development

01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:26.370
of compassionate
behavior, cooperation?

01:00:26.370 --> 01:00:27.570
All of that.

01:00:27.570 --> 01:00:29.520
Widely, widely studied.

01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:32.240
Tons of research that's
been done in this area.

01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:35.160
Much of it ultimately
framed along the lines of,

01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:38.140
what is the development
of moral standards?

01:00:38.140 --> 01:00:39.970
Moral development in kids.

01:00:39.970 --> 01:00:42.860
But what's pertinent
comes long before that.

01:00:42.860 --> 01:00:46.350
Very early in life the most
pertinent initial transition

01:00:46.350 --> 01:00:48.750
is when kids start
distinguishing

01:00:48.750 --> 01:00:51.780
between animate and
inanimate objects.

01:00:51.780 --> 01:00:55.550
And that comes remarkably
early during the first few days

01:00:55.550 --> 01:00:56.760
to weeks of life.

01:00:56.760 --> 01:00:59.420
That's a very early transition.

01:00:59.420 --> 01:01:04.040
And as I think we have
heard already, what you see

01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:06.470
is this specialized
region of the brain,

01:01:06.470 --> 01:01:09.680
the fusiform cortex
that responds to faces,

01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:12.660
and the fact that autistic
individuals, that part

01:01:12.660 --> 01:01:16.290
of their brains do not respond
to faces as in everybody else,

01:01:16.290 --> 01:01:20.780
not necessarily distinguishing
between animate and inanimate.

01:01:20.780 --> 01:01:22.920
So initial stage,
first beginning

01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:25.240
to get that dichotomy down.

01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:28.190
What then emerges is
the first evidence

01:01:28.190 --> 01:01:31.440
of kids beginning to
differentiate themselves

01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:33.540
from the world around
them, beginning

01:01:33.540 --> 01:01:35.340
to get a sense of self.

01:01:35.340 --> 01:01:37.550
And this is where
kids begin to get

01:01:37.550 --> 01:01:39.550
ego boundaries of some sort.

01:01:39.550 --> 01:01:43.130
Before that happens,
a kid very typically

01:01:43.130 --> 01:01:46.520
views themselves as basically
being continuous with mom.

01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:50.330
And this is the world where
you see a 12-month-old where

01:01:50.330 --> 01:01:53.270
mom has a cut on her finger
and has been walking around

01:01:53.270 --> 01:01:56.170
with a Band-Aid and the
kid is there all day

01:01:56.170 --> 01:01:58.940
saying that they have
an owie on their finger.

01:01:58.940 --> 01:02:01.880
Because they are
mom, mom is them.

01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:04.310
There is no particular
boundary between them.

01:02:04.310 --> 01:02:06.650
Around a year of age
is when you begin

01:02:06.650 --> 01:02:09.230
to see this starting to happen.

01:02:09.230 --> 01:02:10.820
So a sense of self.

01:02:10.820 --> 01:02:13.410
What that, of course, has
to be a precursor for it

01:02:13.410 --> 01:02:17.211
a sense of others being
selves, theory of mind.

01:02:17.211 --> 01:02:18.960
So we've already heard
the building blocks

01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:20.080
of theory of mind.

01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:23.230
When do kids first
begin to recognize

01:02:23.230 --> 01:02:26.790
that not only are they
a distinct individual,

01:02:26.790 --> 01:02:30.340
but there are other individuals
with different information,

01:02:30.340 --> 01:02:31.800
with different
thoughts, ultimately

01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:33.170
with different feelings?

01:02:33.170 --> 01:02:35.070
And when does that
begin to emerge?

01:02:35.070 --> 01:02:37.250
Typically between
age of three to five.

01:02:37.250 --> 01:02:40.180
And we've already heard some
of the basic sort of tests

01:02:40.180 --> 01:02:41.820
that are done to reveal that.

01:02:41.820 --> 01:02:44.810
And what you also see
is it is very, very

01:02:44.810 --> 01:02:46.490
emotionally contingent.

01:02:46.490 --> 01:02:49.640
Take a kid who is doing
great theory of mind when

01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:53.170
you read them some abstract
story about Sally Mae

01:02:53.170 --> 01:02:55.080
or, who is it?

01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:55.970
Sarah Ann?

01:02:55.970 --> 01:02:57.040
Sally.

01:02:57.040 --> 01:02:58.260
Sally Ann?

01:02:58.260 --> 01:03:01.370
OK, I seem to not be able
to get this one down.

01:03:01.370 --> 01:03:03.430
That kid with the doll there.

01:03:03.430 --> 01:03:05.330
Read them and they
may be at a point

01:03:05.330 --> 01:03:08.450
where they are three, six months
into being able to perfectly do

01:03:08.450 --> 01:03:09.660
tests like that.

01:03:09.660 --> 01:03:12.560
But get them in an emotional
aroused circumstance

01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:14.950
where it's something
they really care about as

01:03:14.950 --> 01:03:18.170
opposed to like some story
there and the theory of mind

01:03:18.170 --> 01:03:19.990
goes down the tubes
at that point.

01:03:19.990 --> 01:03:22.440
It is not an all
or none transition.

01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:25.240
It is one that is
vulnerable, potentially,

01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:26.360
to strong emotions.

01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:28.950
Go figure, not surprising.

01:03:28.950 --> 01:03:31.005
So what a lot of people
have thought about is,

01:03:31.005 --> 01:03:35.610
is theory of mind a
prerequisite for empathy?

01:03:35.610 --> 01:03:39.010
Is it possible to feel
somebody else's pain

01:03:39.010 --> 01:03:42.060
and act upon it
without having a sense

01:03:42.060 --> 01:03:44.420
that there is a
somebody else who has

01:03:44.420 --> 01:03:46.290
different thoughts
and, most importantly,

01:03:46.290 --> 01:03:47.150
different feelings?

01:03:47.150 --> 01:03:49.660
And they can be bad feelings,
things of that sort.

01:03:49.660 --> 01:03:53.910
Is theory of mind a
prerequisite for empathy?

01:03:53.910 --> 01:03:56.520
And the general sense among
a lot of people in the field

01:03:56.520 --> 01:03:57.760
is, yes, indeed.

01:03:57.760 --> 01:04:00.900
It is necessary
but not sufficient.

01:04:00.900 --> 01:04:04.170
And where you see the
most dramatic dissociation

01:04:04.170 --> 01:04:06.570
between theory of
mind and empathy

01:04:06.570 --> 01:04:08.790
is when you look at sociopaths.

01:04:08.790 --> 01:04:11.510
Every sort of test
that could be done,

01:04:11.510 --> 01:04:15.300
sociopaths have spectacular
theories of mind.

01:04:15.300 --> 01:04:18.940
They are incredibly good
at manipulating people.

01:04:18.940 --> 01:04:23.080
And manipulation requires
a very, very astute theory

01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:25.700
of mind to be able to do that.

01:04:25.700 --> 01:04:29.160
Sociopaths have the
prerequisite of theory of mind

01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:31.350
that most people think
that empathy requires.

01:04:31.350 --> 01:04:34.330
But what you have there
is it stops at that point.

01:04:34.330 --> 01:04:35.390
It does not continue.

01:04:35.390 --> 01:04:40.120
It is a means for exploitation
rather than the transition

01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:42.130
into true empathy.

01:04:42.130 --> 01:04:44.120
As we've already heard,
there is evidence

01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:47.730
for empathy like of that sort
and theory of mind in apes,

01:04:47.730 --> 01:04:49.780
so we're not the only ones.

01:04:49.780 --> 01:04:52.320
So general view being
that you don't get empathy

01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:54.000
until you get theory of mind.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.250
But there's always been
this confusing sort

01:04:56.250 --> 01:04:58.870
of counter bit of evidence
where you see stuff

01:04:58.870 --> 01:05:02.890
like the world of a
15-month-old where somebody

01:05:02.890 --> 01:05:04.640
is sitting in the room crying.

01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:07.770
And often in experiments
someone who is pretending to.

01:05:07.770 --> 01:05:09.920
And the 15-month-old
will come up

01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:12.090
and try to give the
paci to the person

01:05:12.090 --> 01:05:13.660
and try to put it
in their mouth.

01:05:13.660 --> 01:05:15.820
Here, feel better.

01:05:15.820 --> 01:05:18.970
So possible
interpretations, number one

01:05:18.970 --> 01:05:22.070
being that this is already
evidence of empathy.

01:05:22.070 --> 01:05:24.880
Empathy not yet having the
theory of mind element of not

01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:27.430
only recognizing there's
somebody else, but not

01:05:27.430 --> 01:05:29.560
everybody likes
pacies, especially mine

01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:31.090
that I've been slobbering on.

01:05:31.090 --> 01:05:35.150
Other interpretation, an
irritation decreasing strategy,

01:05:35.150 --> 01:05:38.040
which is it's simply
distressing having the person

01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:39.930
in there acting all upset.

01:05:39.930 --> 01:05:42.100
And what's going to
make them shut up?

01:05:42.100 --> 01:05:45.640
I know, I'm going to go over
to them and give them my stuffy

01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:46.970
and maybe that will work.

01:05:46.970 --> 01:05:48.790
It is not empathy.

01:05:48.790 --> 01:05:52.170
It is attempts to get away
from this irritating context.

01:05:52.170 --> 01:05:55.930
Studies very interestingly,
though, arguing against that.

01:05:55.930 --> 01:05:59.530
Take kids during their first
three to six months of life

01:05:59.530 --> 01:06:04.040
and show them a scenario where
two people are interacting.

01:06:04.040 --> 01:06:07.510
One of them needs help
and the other helps them.

01:06:07.510 --> 01:06:11.010
Or one of them needs help
and the other doesn't.

01:06:11.010 --> 01:06:13.960
Or one of them has
something and the other one

01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:15.380
takes the thing away from them.

01:06:15.380 --> 01:06:18.140
So either pro-social
behavior, neutral,

01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:19.700
or anti-social behavior.

01:06:19.700 --> 01:06:21.850
And kids in that
age range already

01:06:21.850 --> 01:06:24.730
prefer to look at the
individual who's doing

01:06:24.730 --> 01:06:27.040
the pro-social helpful thing.

01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:31.350
So some sort of elements of
this are already in there

01:06:31.350 --> 01:06:33.280
before formal theory of mind.

01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:37.040
None the less, that seems to
be a big important part of it.

01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:39.770
Next, so you got
yourself theory of mind

01:06:39.770 --> 01:06:42.550
and the next step in there
is not only recognition

01:06:42.550 --> 01:06:44.430
that somebody else
has other thoughts

01:06:44.430 --> 01:06:45.750
but they have other feelings.

01:06:45.750 --> 01:06:47.380
They can be very
different from yours.

01:06:47.380 --> 01:06:48.940
They can be legitimate.

01:06:48.940 --> 01:06:52.410
And what we begin to enter
now is the more formal world

01:06:52.410 --> 01:06:54.470
of moral development in kids.

01:06:54.470 --> 01:06:58.410
And the name, the-- without
question-- the most influential

01:06:58.410 --> 01:07:01.166
psychologist in this whole
field, one of the biggest

01:07:01.166 --> 01:07:03.040
names in the whole field
in the last century,

01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:04.810
this guy Lawrence Kohlberg.

01:07:04.810 --> 01:07:09.650
And Kohlberg's famed stages
of moral development in kids.

01:07:09.650 --> 01:07:13.350
How many of you are
familiar with Kohlberg?

01:07:13.350 --> 01:07:15.741
How many are not?

01:07:15.741 --> 01:07:16.240
Good.

01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:17.560
Kohlberg is.

01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:19.010
So Kohlberg.

01:07:19.010 --> 01:07:21.920
Lawrence Kohlberg was a
psychologist at Harvard,

01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:23.540
super influential.

01:07:23.540 --> 01:07:25.920
And he came out of
tradition established

01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:28.080
by the Swiss psychologist.

01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:30.250
It's never possible to
just say the psychologist.

01:07:30.250 --> 01:07:33.490
You always have to see the
Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget.

01:07:33.490 --> 01:07:35.780
And Piaget brought
in the whole notion

01:07:35.780 --> 01:07:40.460
of sequences of development,
sequences as in kids

01:07:40.460 --> 01:07:42.390
crawl before they walk.

01:07:42.390 --> 01:07:45.920
Kids comprehend language before
they begin to produce it.

01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:49.190
And Piaget generated a
whole world of information

01:07:49.190 --> 01:07:52.370
about stages of
cognitive development.

01:07:52.370 --> 01:07:55.220
At what age do kids
have object permanence?

01:07:55.220 --> 01:07:58.080
You cover something, is
the object still existing

01:07:58.080 --> 01:08:00.850
or do you get all surprised
when you take the lid off

01:08:00.850 --> 01:08:03.460
and it's still there and
start breathing faster?

01:08:03.460 --> 01:08:06.020
Stages of cognitive maturation.

01:08:06.020 --> 01:08:08.080
And Kohlberg came
out of that tradition

01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:11.280
looking instead at
sequential development

01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:14.170
of moral development.

01:08:14.170 --> 01:08:16.520
The theme that ran through
this whole sort of world

01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:19.210
of sequential
whatevers is that you

01:08:19.210 --> 01:08:21.960
don't have the sequence change.

01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:25.109
There are no kids ever who
run before they're crawling.

01:08:25.109 --> 01:08:27.649
There are no kids who are
fluidly producing language

01:08:27.649 --> 01:08:29.090
before they comprehend it.

01:08:29.090 --> 01:08:30.500
It's a set sequence.

01:08:30.500 --> 01:08:32.069
What does experience do?

01:08:32.069 --> 01:08:34.700
It regulates the rate,
the speed with which

01:08:34.700 --> 01:08:36.200
you make the transitions.

01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:38.210
So Kohlberg introduced
the whole notion

01:08:38.210 --> 01:08:41.819
that there are also sequences
of moral development.

01:08:41.819 --> 01:08:44.020
Very broadly what
he came up with

01:08:44.020 --> 01:08:47.330
were six different categories,
six different steps.

01:08:47.330 --> 01:08:50.479
And people, I take it, have
been spending the rest of time

01:08:50.479 --> 01:08:53.710
deciding whether there is,
in fact, 60 sub parts of that

01:08:53.710 --> 01:08:55.800
and splitting and
lumping all of that.

01:08:55.800 --> 01:08:59.050
Broadly these six stages
fall into three categories,

01:08:59.050 --> 01:09:04.090
what he called preconventional
moral reasoning,

01:09:04.090 --> 01:09:09.470
conventional moral reasoning,
and post-conventional moral

01:09:09.470 --> 01:09:11.010
reasoning.

01:09:11.010 --> 01:09:13.540
You might have guessed that
after the pre in conventional,

01:09:13.540 --> 01:09:15.350
but those were the three phases.

01:09:15.350 --> 01:09:18.529
And broadly they could
be termed or framed

01:09:18.529 --> 01:09:22.609
in terms of what the motivation
is for acting morally.

01:09:22.609 --> 01:09:26.240
In the preconventional stage,
why do you act morally?

01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:28.500
Because you may get caught.

01:09:28.500 --> 01:09:31.069
Because you may get punished.

01:09:31.069 --> 01:09:34.790
Because if you act morally,
maybe you'll get a reward.

01:09:34.790 --> 01:09:36.040
What's in it for me?

01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:41.160
A very ego centered set of
motivations for moral behavior.

01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:44.580
Then transitioning into
the conventional stage.

01:09:44.580 --> 01:09:46.880
How that is typically
framed as is

01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:49.660
your motivations for
your moral behavior

01:09:49.660 --> 01:09:53.760
are based on shared group
values, shared group

01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:54.740
conventions.

01:09:54.740 --> 01:09:57.820
Things built around
social norms.

01:09:57.820 --> 01:10:01.390
Rules, laws, even a
higher level of belief

01:10:01.390 --> 01:10:04.160
in the importance
of law and order

01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:07.360
in a society transcending
any given law,

01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:10.680
a notion that if you
follow conventional rules

01:10:10.680 --> 01:10:14.250
of moral reasoning you will
be viewed by society at large

01:10:14.250 --> 01:10:19.100
as a good girl, as a good boy
at whatever developmental stage.

01:10:19.100 --> 01:10:23.550
Your moral reasoning being
built around society-wide rules

01:10:23.550 --> 01:10:24.810
and implications.

01:10:24.810 --> 01:10:27.220
Finally, the
post-conventional stage

01:10:27.220 --> 01:10:29.620
is built around
transcending that.

01:10:29.620 --> 01:10:31.970
The word transcendence
plays a lot

01:10:31.970 --> 01:10:34.210
in that realm of
Kohlberg's thinking.

01:10:34.210 --> 01:10:37.930
The notion that there
are all sorts of examples

01:10:37.930 --> 01:10:40.980
of moral reasoning, moral
decision making, where

01:10:40.980 --> 01:10:45.090
you are, in fact, violating
the rules of society.

01:10:45.090 --> 01:10:46.800
You are breaking a law.

01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:48.870
You are breaking a social norm.

01:10:48.870 --> 01:10:50.800
What's the motivation there?

01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:52.610
The notion that
there are things that

01:10:52.610 --> 01:10:55.990
are more important than
the laws of society.

01:10:55.990 --> 01:10:58.480
There are things that are
more important than what

01:10:58.480 --> 01:10:59.970
everybody else thinks.

01:10:59.970 --> 01:11:03.870
What this has because it is the
world of civil disobedience.

01:11:03.870 --> 01:11:07.720
This is the world of saying,
bad laws need to be broken.

01:11:07.720 --> 01:11:09.780
This is the world
of people saying,

01:11:09.780 --> 01:11:12.280
I don't care if I get punished.

01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:15.100
I don't care what
everybody else is doing.

01:11:15.100 --> 01:11:16.940
This is the right thing to do.

01:11:16.940 --> 01:11:19.050
That would be a
post-conventional Kohlberg

01:11:19.050 --> 01:11:20.190
stage.

01:11:20.190 --> 01:11:22.625
The main thinking that
goes into sort of Kohlberg

01:11:22.625 --> 01:11:24.800
then looking at
adult moral reasoning

01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:28.210
is as you go through the various
steps and these sub steps

01:11:28.210 --> 01:11:31.050
and all sorts of tests that
ostensibly sort of tapped

01:11:31.050 --> 01:11:34.810
into it, not everybody
reaches the same Kohlberg

01:11:34.810 --> 01:11:36.460
stage in adulthood.

01:11:36.460 --> 01:11:39.320
People will stop in
their conventional stage.

01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:42.300
Some people will get to a
partial post-conventional

01:11:42.300 --> 01:11:42.970
stage.

01:11:42.970 --> 01:11:45.560
The way of thinking of
people within this framework

01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:49.670
is, how far do you progress
in your cold Kohlbergian

01:11:49.670 --> 01:11:54.340
sort of ladder of
complexity, sophistication,

01:11:54.340 --> 01:11:56.510
in your moral reasoning?

01:11:56.510 --> 01:11:58.330
Ways in which this would look.

01:11:58.330 --> 01:12:01.860
Take somebody and you can
have a Kohlberg stage of being

01:12:01.860 --> 01:12:03.740
very focused on the individual.

01:12:03.740 --> 01:12:05.860
Sort of studies
that will be done.

01:12:05.860 --> 01:12:09.500
You have a kid who believes
there is a baseball team.

01:12:09.500 --> 01:12:12.960
And they're told that
here's a bunch of kids.

01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:15.250
There's one more spot
left on the baseball team.

01:12:15.250 --> 01:12:18.420
And this has always been
a team for boys and boys

01:12:18.420 --> 01:12:20.210
play baseball better than girls.

01:12:20.210 --> 01:12:22.780
This was the sort of
way this type of study

01:12:22.780 --> 01:12:24.620
was done some decades ago.

01:12:24.620 --> 01:12:25.900
And here's a girl.

01:12:25.900 --> 01:12:27.900
Typically we don't
allow girls on the team.

01:12:27.900 --> 01:12:29.800
But this one girl wants to play.

01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:33.630
And what you see is at a
preconventional stage what kids

01:12:33.630 --> 01:12:37.200
are most likely to do is
reason morally on the level

01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:39.210
of individual consequences.

01:12:39.210 --> 01:12:43.136
Saying things like, well, she
hasn't gotten to play before.

01:12:43.136 --> 01:12:45.010
All of these boys have
gotten to play before.

01:12:45.010 --> 01:12:46.630
She's never gotten
to play before.

01:12:46.630 --> 01:12:47.660
It would be fair.

01:12:47.660 --> 01:12:49.770
She's the one who
should get to play.

01:12:49.770 --> 01:12:51.340
By the time you get
to kids reaching

01:12:51.340 --> 01:12:54.190
conventional moral
reasoning stages, what

01:12:54.190 --> 01:12:57.400
they're doing instead is
saying, well, boys are better.

01:12:57.400 --> 01:13:00.140
We need to put one of the
boys on because the team will

01:13:00.140 --> 01:13:01.750
be more successful.

01:13:01.750 --> 01:13:04.930
Suddenly moving from the level
of individual consequences

01:13:04.930 --> 01:13:09.700
to norms and law and order
and things of that sort.

01:13:09.700 --> 01:13:12.210
So the general
framework of Kohlberg.

01:13:12.210 --> 01:13:15.480
And amid that becoming
the dominating model.

01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:18.820
There has been a gazillion
totally appropriate criticisms

01:13:18.820 --> 01:13:20.080
of it.

01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:25.850
One is focusing right off the
bat on gender and the fact

01:13:25.850 --> 01:13:29.410
that Kohlberg, doing his
stuff mostly in the 1960s,

01:13:29.410 --> 01:13:32.100
had the same biases as most
everyone of the time, which

01:13:32.100 --> 01:13:34.400
was a very disproportionate
share of the studies

01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:37.210
were done on males
rather than females.

01:13:37.210 --> 01:13:40.050
The notion that Kohlbergian
reasoning sequences

01:13:40.050 --> 01:13:42.510
of moral development are
a better fit for what

01:13:42.510 --> 01:13:46.820
happens in boys and men
than in women, girls.

01:13:46.820 --> 01:13:50.120
That boys are more about
justice girls are more about

01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:53.550
affiliation, reconciliation,
things of that sort.

01:13:53.550 --> 01:13:55.650
So a gender critique.

01:13:55.650 --> 01:13:57.660
Next is a cultural critique.

01:13:57.660 --> 01:13:59.410
And there's been a
whole world of people

01:13:59.410 --> 01:14:02.620
doing cross-cultural moral
development in [INAUDIBLE] type

01:14:02.620 --> 01:14:03.250
studies.

01:14:03.250 --> 01:14:06.400
And one thing that you
see is that the stages

01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:09.620
don't necessarily move in
this inevitable sequence

01:14:09.620 --> 01:14:10.810
in different cultures.

01:14:10.810 --> 01:14:13.345
So that has been sort
of a blow to this.

01:14:13.345 --> 01:14:17.620
This is how all humans are.

01:14:17.620 --> 01:14:20.180
What you also begin
to see is when

01:14:20.180 --> 01:14:23.620
you begin to couple
sort of other values

01:14:23.620 --> 01:14:25.070
with your moral stage.

01:14:25.070 --> 01:14:28.480
For example, what
studies show is people

01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:33.040
who are trained in childhood
to respect ability more than

01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:38.340
effort are far more likely
to endorse social norm

01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:42.570
moral reasoning over
social justice reasoning.

01:14:42.570 --> 01:14:43.890
That is shown.

01:14:43.890 --> 01:14:45.000
What's that one about?

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.910
Again, ability--
having something

01:14:47.910 --> 01:14:52.030
that you view as transcendent,
as not intrinsic to sort

01:14:52.030 --> 01:14:54.152
of the effort of the person.

01:14:54.152 --> 01:14:55.110
That's making no sense.

01:14:55.110 --> 01:14:56.900
I just tied that into knots.

01:14:56.900 --> 01:14:58.290
Don't listen to
what I just said.

01:14:58.290 --> 01:15:00.760
Nonetheless, here's
what they have found.

01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:05.070
People who were brought up to
value ability more than effort

01:15:05.070 --> 01:15:09.090
tend to value moral
reasoning for social norms

01:15:09.090 --> 01:15:11.080
rather than for social justice.

01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:14.740
They are less likely to get to
a post-conventional Kohlberg

01:15:14.740 --> 01:15:15.720
stage.

01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:18.055
So that being one of
the backbones of people

01:15:18.055 --> 01:15:18.930
who think about this.

01:15:18.930 --> 01:15:21.210
But a whole world
of additional things

01:15:21.210 --> 01:15:23.130
in moral development and kids.

01:15:23.130 --> 01:15:27.900
How do kids first learn that
sometimes it's OK to lie?

01:15:27.900 --> 01:15:30.180
How do kids learn
that, in fact, you're

01:15:30.180 --> 01:15:33.890
supposed to tell grandma that
you love the sweater even

01:15:33.890 --> 01:15:35.320
though you think it's awful?

01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:38.700
Or do not tell her you
already have this toy?

01:15:38.700 --> 01:15:41.430
How do you kids learn to lie?

01:15:41.430 --> 01:15:43.510
Related to that,
how do kids first

01:15:43.510 --> 01:15:47.600
learn the difference between
rules and principles?

01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:50.080
Rules that are meant
to be less breakable,

01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:53.590
principles where you are having
to balance them to weigh them.

01:15:53.590 --> 01:15:56.240
When do kids first learn
about the possibility

01:15:56.240 --> 01:15:58.290
of there being bad laws?

01:15:58.290 --> 01:15:59.910
That just because
something is a law

01:15:59.910 --> 01:16:01.950
doesn't mean it is
necessarily good?

01:16:01.950 --> 01:16:05.900
When do kids first start to
consistently make distinctions

01:16:05.900 --> 01:16:10.500
between or see the similarities
between intended harm

01:16:10.500 --> 01:16:12.470
and successful harm?

01:16:12.470 --> 01:16:15.630
At an earlier stage
kids discount activities

01:16:15.630 --> 01:16:17.660
that don't actually
produce the harm

01:16:17.660 --> 01:16:20.740
that it was meant to
if it's not successful.

01:16:20.740 --> 01:16:24.590
When do kids begin to see that
they are more similar than they

01:16:24.590 --> 01:16:25.560
initially respond to?

01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:29.600
All of these nuances,
subtleties, here.

01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:32.110
Other ways that people have
thought about development

01:16:32.110 --> 01:16:33.340
of aggression.

01:16:33.340 --> 01:16:37.360
Now comes the issue of
peer groups and community

01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:41.540
and aspects of what sort of
world are you being exposed to?

01:16:41.540 --> 01:16:45.480
What this always
comes down to is,

01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:48.430
what are the effects on
violence in growing up

01:16:48.430 --> 01:16:51.600
in a violent setting and
being witness to violence

01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:52.990
and being a victim of violence?

01:16:52.990 --> 01:16:54.940
We've already seen
one realm of this

01:16:54.940 --> 01:16:58.770
which is the greater the
incidence of childhood abuse,

01:16:58.770 --> 01:17:02.480
the greater the likelihood
of adult anti-social behavior

01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:05.900
and a huge
interaction with genes

01:17:05.900 --> 01:17:09.220
that have a relevance
to the neurochemistry.

01:17:09.220 --> 01:17:10.730
What else is shown?

01:17:10.730 --> 01:17:13.750
Consistently, study
after study, shows

01:17:13.750 --> 01:17:16.850
that independent of
family circumstances,

01:17:16.850 --> 01:17:20.730
socioeconomic status, personal
experience of violence,

01:17:20.730 --> 01:17:22.630
after controlling
for all of that,

01:17:22.630 --> 01:17:24.300
growing up in a
neighborhood where

01:17:24.300 --> 01:17:27.300
there is a lot of violence
feeds into a higher

01:17:27.300 --> 01:17:28.850
rate of violence in adulthood.

01:17:28.850 --> 01:17:30.960
What it does is rationalize it.

01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:33.130
What it does is it desensitizes.

01:17:33.130 --> 01:17:34.810
So that is shown consistently.

01:17:34.810 --> 01:17:38.490
What is shown is there is even
a stronger effect, tapping

01:17:38.490 --> 01:17:40.960
right into this,
when one is witness

01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:42.405
to violence within the family.

01:17:42.405 --> 01:17:44.370
So violence within
neighborhoods.

01:17:44.370 --> 01:17:46.500
This was worked on a
number of years ago.

01:17:46.500 --> 01:17:48.640
Sociologist,
psychiatrist at Harvard

01:17:48.640 --> 01:17:52.770
named Felton Earls going through
very, very careful studies

01:17:52.770 --> 01:17:54.750
controlling for all
sorts of factors

01:17:54.750 --> 01:17:57.290
of how many violent
acts were kids

01:17:57.290 --> 01:18:00.360
seeing in various
communities as they grew up.

01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:03.660
And that is a very strong
predictor in and of itself.

01:18:03.660 --> 01:18:07.800
Violent acts within the
family even more so.

01:18:07.800 --> 01:18:09.910
That, of course,
brings up another one

01:18:09.910 --> 01:18:12.350
of the great perpetual
questions is,

01:18:12.350 --> 01:18:14.740
what is the effect on
adult violence of having

01:18:14.740 --> 01:18:18.590
been a kid growing up watching
a lot of violent television

01:18:18.590 --> 01:18:21.600
or a lot of violent movies
or, as the studies are now

01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:24.850
beginning to be there, to
ask violent video games?

01:18:24.850 --> 01:18:26.180
What's that one about?

01:18:26.180 --> 01:18:28.230
And every parent for
decades has known,

01:18:28.230 --> 01:18:30.860
of course, what the worry,
which is watching violence

01:18:30.860 --> 01:18:33.440
in any sort of version
of media like this

01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:35.860
is going to foster
violence intensely.

01:18:35.860 --> 01:18:37.310
Well studied subject.

01:18:37.310 --> 01:18:39.450
And what the results
generally show

01:18:39.450 --> 01:18:42.130
is-- yes, here it comes again.

01:18:42.130 --> 01:18:43.430
The same exact thing.

01:18:43.430 --> 01:18:46.760
Watching a lot of violent
television when you were a kid

01:18:46.760 --> 01:18:49.660
makes you more violent
if you already are

01:18:49.660 --> 01:18:51.440
tending towards being violent.

01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:54.760
What it does is it exaggerates
the pre-existing social

01:18:54.760 --> 01:18:55.620
tendencies.

01:18:55.620 --> 01:18:57.070
You know that drill by now.

01:18:57.070 --> 01:19:01.040
After this lecture you could now
pull out half a dozen examples

01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:05.160
of x does not cause whatever,
but it magnifies or blunts

01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:06.680
preexisting tendencies.

01:19:06.680 --> 01:19:09.150
That's what the literature
consistently shows.

01:19:09.150 --> 01:19:12.850
Violent television,
movies, reading material

01:19:12.850 --> 01:19:17.050
and violent video games does
not increase the likelihood

01:19:17.050 --> 01:19:18.140
of being violent.

01:19:18.140 --> 01:19:19.650
It's only in kids
who are already

01:19:19.650 --> 01:19:22.380
predisposed towards that.

01:19:22.380 --> 01:19:25.460
Next, more aspects
of environment.

01:19:25.460 --> 01:19:29.990
Here we have the summary of
the classic study that was

01:19:29.990 --> 01:19:31.710
done a couple of decades ago.

01:19:31.710 --> 01:19:34.540
Couple at the University of
Toronto named Daly and Wilson.

01:19:34.540 --> 01:19:37.750
And what they did was
look at the likelihood

01:19:37.750 --> 01:19:42.807
of men committing murder
as a function of their age.

01:19:42.807 --> 01:19:45.390
And they were interested in age
because they were viewing that

01:19:45.390 --> 01:19:47.770
as a proxy for
testosterone levels.

01:19:47.770 --> 01:19:50.170
And what they showed looking
in three different cities--

01:19:50.170 --> 01:19:53.570
Chicago, Toronto, and London--
which was in all those cities

01:19:53.570 --> 01:19:57.490
your likelihood of being
violent or committing a murder,

01:19:57.490 --> 01:20:00.410
if you were male was
somewhere late teenage years

01:20:00.410 --> 01:20:02.070
into early 20s or so.

01:20:02.070 --> 01:20:03.850
I drew this a little bit wrong.

01:20:03.850 --> 01:20:06.540
And that was fascinating
to them because that

01:20:06.540 --> 01:20:09.890
happens to be the time of life
when males have their highest

01:20:09.890 --> 01:20:11.080
testosterone levels.

01:20:11.080 --> 01:20:14.090
And what was hugely
interesting in that study

01:20:14.090 --> 01:20:17.360
was that the curves were
superimposable in these three

01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:18.450
different cities.

01:20:18.450 --> 01:20:22.410
One American city, one Canadian
city, one British city.

01:20:22.410 --> 01:20:24.670
So you could now ask
the sort of question

01:20:24.670 --> 01:20:26.890
that we've had coming up
since the behavior genetics

01:20:26.890 --> 01:20:30.260
lectures, which is if
you could know only one

01:20:30.260 --> 01:20:33.065
thing about these
group of individual men

01:20:33.065 --> 01:20:35.190
and you want to know
something about predictability

01:20:35.190 --> 01:20:37.799
of their being aggressive,
what's the one thing you would

01:20:37.799 --> 01:20:38.340
want to know?

01:20:38.340 --> 01:20:41.720
Well, it would be mighty useful
to know how old they are.

01:20:41.720 --> 01:20:45.180
Because this suggests a big
age effect and maybe that's

01:20:45.180 --> 01:20:47.120
got something to do with
the high testosterone

01:20:47.120 --> 01:20:48.440
at that point.

01:20:48.440 --> 01:20:50.800
And one of these sort
of relevant to that,

01:20:50.800 --> 01:20:53.860
sort of a classic sort of
sound byte in criminology,

01:20:53.860 --> 01:20:58.030
is one of the leading causes of
a decrease in criminal behavior

01:20:58.030 --> 01:21:00.380
is people turning age 25.

01:21:00.380 --> 01:21:03.170
It's a very, very strong
maturational curve.

01:21:03.170 --> 01:21:03.947
So look at that.

01:21:03.947 --> 01:21:05.030
Look at this is important.

01:21:05.030 --> 01:21:07.870
This is sort of life
history trajectory.

01:21:07.870 --> 01:21:10.910
But then you look at something
even more interesting,

01:21:10.910 --> 01:21:14.160
which is you ask, so how
many murders are there

01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:15.540
in each of these cities?

01:21:15.540 --> 01:21:20.070
And in their database the
London one averaged 30 year,

01:21:20.070 --> 01:21:25.290
Toronto averaged 50, and
Chicago averaged 600.

01:21:25.290 --> 01:21:27.530
So now you have a choice.

01:21:27.530 --> 01:21:30.840
You could find out one
fact and one fact only.

01:21:30.840 --> 01:21:34.570
Do I want to know how old this
individual is or-- let's even

01:21:34.570 --> 01:21:37.100
be fancier-- do I want
to know this individual's

01:21:37.100 --> 01:21:39.150
testosterone levels and his age?

01:21:39.150 --> 01:21:40.840
Do I want to know
that information

01:21:40.840 --> 01:21:44.170
or do I want to know what
society he's been growing up

01:21:44.170 --> 01:21:44.680
with?

01:21:44.680 --> 01:21:47.880
Without question you
get more predictability.

01:21:47.880 --> 01:21:50.060
This is far more important.

01:21:50.060 --> 01:21:52.880
We now can sort of put
inheritability type

01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:54.150
interpretations.

01:21:54.150 --> 01:21:55.750
Yeah, this is important.

01:21:55.750 --> 01:21:57.970
But it doesn't hold
a candle to whatever

01:21:57.970 --> 01:22:01.640
these environmental factors
are in there-- far, far

01:22:01.640 --> 01:22:05.940
bigger effects than the
age effect happening here.

01:22:05.940 --> 01:22:07.810
What else?

01:22:07.810 --> 01:22:11.350
So again, this business
about socialization involving

01:22:11.350 --> 01:22:13.430
lots of teaching of context.

01:22:13.430 --> 01:22:16.240
And more evidence for this
came from one of the all time

01:22:16.240 --> 01:22:19.510
classic studies, one that
was referred to in the sex

01:22:19.510 --> 01:22:20.010
lectures.

01:22:20.010 --> 01:22:23.010
And this was the work
by that guy Harry Harlow

01:22:23.010 --> 01:22:25.220
raising captive rhesus monkeys.

01:22:25.220 --> 01:22:27.310
And we heard
different variations.

01:22:27.310 --> 01:22:29.370
Raising them without a mother.

01:22:29.370 --> 01:22:32.140
Raising them in social
groups with peers.

01:22:32.140 --> 01:22:34.820
Raising them in complete
social isolation.

01:22:34.820 --> 01:22:36.780
And what we heard
last week was, it

01:22:36.780 --> 01:22:41.020
did not change the fixed action
patterns of sexual behavior.

01:22:41.020 --> 01:22:42.562
It changed the context.

01:22:42.562 --> 01:22:44.020
In other words,
you had monkeys who

01:22:44.020 --> 01:22:47.470
had grown up in some of the most
of the isolated environments

01:22:47.470 --> 01:22:50.480
and they were trying to do sex
normally but just with things

01:22:50.480 --> 01:22:53.120
that the monkeys don't
normally have sex with.

01:22:53.120 --> 01:22:56.090
The same exact thing in the
realm of aggression here.

01:22:56.090 --> 01:22:58.640
Being raised, for example,
in social isolation

01:22:58.640 --> 01:23:01.580
as a rhesus monkey, then in
the young adulthood you're

01:23:01.580 --> 01:23:06.230
put into a social group and you
have perfectly normal threat

01:23:06.230 --> 01:23:06.730
yawns.

01:23:06.730 --> 01:23:09.760
You have perfectly normal
fixed action patterns

01:23:09.760 --> 01:23:12.090
of dominance and subordination.

01:23:12.090 --> 01:23:15.350
What you don't know is who
you should be doing it to.

01:23:15.350 --> 01:23:17.660
And Harlow showed that
these animals then put

01:23:17.660 --> 01:23:20.320
into social groups
were threatening

01:23:20.320 --> 01:23:21.890
high ranking males
they shouldn't

01:23:21.890 --> 01:23:23.140
have been going anywhere near.

01:23:23.140 --> 01:23:26.040
Were terrified and
subordinating themselves

01:23:26.040 --> 01:23:29.100
to little pipsqueak infants
there, things of that sort.

01:23:29.100 --> 01:23:32.870
They had not learned the
appropriate social context.

01:23:32.870 --> 01:23:35.260
And that's an awful
lot of what's going on.

01:23:35.260 --> 01:23:36.404
Example of this.

01:23:36.404 --> 01:23:38.070
And this is one that
I actually observed

01:23:38.070 --> 01:23:42.270
in my baboons some years ago
and this business about context.

01:23:42.270 --> 01:23:45.990
Back to baboons and female
baboons, the business there.

01:23:45.990 --> 01:23:47.810
If you are a high
ranking female,

01:23:47.810 --> 01:23:50.640
you have far more options to
be aggressive than if you're

01:23:50.640 --> 01:23:51.710
a low ranking one.

01:23:51.710 --> 01:23:54.560
You inherit your rank
from your mother.

01:23:54.560 --> 01:23:56.720
If your mother is
number one in the troop,

01:23:56.720 --> 01:23:58.740
you, her first daughter,
will be number two.

01:23:58.740 --> 01:24:01.770
If your mother was number 12
and your her second daughter,

01:24:01.770 --> 01:24:03.570
you're going to be number 14.

01:24:03.570 --> 01:24:05.400
It's a hereditary system.

01:24:05.400 --> 01:24:07.630
And this was some
years ago where it just

01:24:07.630 --> 01:24:11.250
happened in one of my troops
the highest ranking female who

01:24:11.250 --> 01:24:13.430
was still fertile,
her mother matriarch

01:24:13.430 --> 01:24:15.160
was one step above her.

01:24:15.160 --> 01:24:17.020
But this female,
the highest ranking

01:24:17.020 --> 01:24:20.100
for a female, gave birth,
had her first daughter.

01:24:20.100 --> 01:24:22.210
And it just happened
a day later one

01:24:22.210 --> 01:24:24.330
of the lower ranking
females in the troop

01:24:24.330 --> 01:24:26.180
also gave birth
and had a daughter.

01:24:26.180 --> 01:24:29.650
So suddenly you've got this
great side by side comparison.

01:24:29.650 --> 01:24:32.900
And what you see was every
developmental landmark

01:24:32.900 --> 01:24:36.120
the high ranking kid was hitting
earlier than the other kid just

01:24:36.120 --> 01:24:38.840
in terms of sheer physical
maturation, coordination,

01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:39.570
all of that.

01:24:39.570 --> 01:24:41.710
When they were about
a week old, they

01:24:41.710 --> 01:24:44.090
had their first
social interaction.

01:24:44.090 --> 01:24:46.850
Low ranking infant spots
the high ranking one

01:24:46.850 --> 01:24:48.750
and obviously is
thrilled, finally

01:24:48.750 --> 01:24:50.686
seeing somebody else
the same size as them

01:24:50.686 --> 01:24:52.560
instead of just looking
at everybody's knees.

01:24:52.560 --> 01:24:54.940
And the low ranking
one goes wobbling over

01:24:54.940 --> 01:24:56.430
to sort of greet this other one.

01:24:56.430 --> 01:24:58.350
And as she gets about
three steps away

01:24:58.350 --> 01:25:01.310
from a high ranking
infant, low ranking mom

01:25:01.310 --> 01:25:04.480
leans over, grabs her
daughter by the tail,

01:25:04.480 --> 01:25:06.750
and pulls her back.

01:25:06.750 --> 01:25:09.620
And she had just
gotten her first lesson

01:25:09.620 --> 01:25:13.250
in her appropriate social rank
and her appropriate social

01:25:13.250 --> 01:25:14.100
behavior.

01:25:14.100 --> 01:25:15.690
She had just gotten
the first lesson

01:25:15.690 --> 01:25:19.429
that that is not somebody you
go up to and interact with.

01:25:19.429 --> 01:25:20.970
If you're going to
interact with her,

01:25:20.970 --> 01:25:24.470
what it's going to consist
of is you sitting real still

01:25:24.470 --> 01:25:26.850
and don't make any
eye contact and hope

01:25:26.850 --> 01:25:27.920
she doesn't notice you.

01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:30.630
And if she does, immediately
make a subordinate gesture.

01:25:30.630 --> 01:25:33.310
You do not go and walk
up to her to greet her.

01:25:33.310 --> 01:25:36.120
And the amazing thing is
at that point you pick up

01:25:36.120 --> 01:25:38.660
and you come back 25
years later and there

01:25:38.660 --> 01:25:41.600
are going to be two old ladies
out in the savanna there doing

01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:43.840
the same exact
ominous interactions

01:25:43.840 --> 01:25:46.240
that they learned in
their first week of life.

01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:50.510
Very, very early social
training for this.

01:25:50.510 --> 01:25:53.630
Finally, another bit of evidence
for that social training, which

01:25:53.630 --> 01:25:56.730
we already heard about, the
captive hyenas growing up

01:25:56.730 --> 01:25:59.310
without adults there
took much longer

01:25:59.310 --> 01:26:02.410
to come through with the
same social dominance system

01:26:02.410 --> 01:26:05.230
that you would see with
animals in the wild.

01:26:05.230 --> 01:26:07.590
So the question then
becomes, amid all

01:26:07.590 --> 01:26:10.700
of this social environment
mattering hugely,

01:26:10.700 --> 01:26:14.420
how important are parents and
how important is peer group?

01:26:14.420 --> 01:26:16.920
And a very, very
interesting book

01:26:16.920 --> 01:26:19.610
came out about a decade
ago by a psychologist

01:26:19.610 --> 01:26:23.010
named Judith Rich Harris
called The Nurture Assumption.

01:26:23.010 --> 01:26:26.110
And what she did was
basically strongly

01:26:26.110 --> 01:26:28.890
attack the literature
on parental influence

01:26:28.890 --> 01:26:30.200
on child development.

01:26:30.200 --> 01:26:33.140
And her argument was
that peer influences

01:26:33.140 --> 01:26:38.200
are vastly more powerful than
the field usually recognizes.

01:26:38.200 --> 01:26:39.540
Great story with her.

01:26:39.540 --> 01:26:41.980
She was about 60 at the time.

01:26:41.980 --> 01:26:45.180
And many decades before she
had been a graduate student

01:26:45.180 --> 01:26:47.130
in psychology at Harvard.

01:26:47.130 --> 01:26:49.070
And something was
not working out

01:26:49.070 --> 01:26:51.130
and she was expelled
from the program.

01:26:51.130 --> 01:26:54.120
And the chair of the
department, a guy named

01:26:54.120 --> 01:26:56.840
George Miller at the time,
was the one who told her

01:26:56.840 --> 01:26:58.280
that this wasn't working out.

01:26:58.280 --> 01:27:01.820
So good luck and off
you go to trade school

01:27:01.820 --> 01:27:05.580
and she proceeded to,
never finishing her degree,

01:27:05.580 --> 01:27:09.210
become a science writer
and writing science books

01:27:09.210 --> 01:27:10.260
for kids or whatever.

01:27:10.260 --> 01:27:13.310
And around age 55 she started
writing this book, which

01:27:13.310 --> 01:27:16.790
wound up being an
amazing book, extremely

01:27:16.790 --> 01:27:20.170
influential in the field, where
she got all sorts of prizes

01:27:20.170 --> 01:27:23.160
for being the first
book by a young author.

01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:25.540
Young author, 60 years
old at that point.

01:27:25.540 --> 01:27:27.040
And one of the great
ironies was she

01:27:27.040 --> 01:27:29.710
got like the grand
prize for the first book

01:27:29.710 --> 01:27:32.080
at the annual meeting of
the American Psychological

01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:35.430
Association, getting this
prize called the George Miller

01:27:35.430 --> 01:27:39.610
Award given out by the now
very elderly George Miller.

01:27:39.610 --> 01:27:42.950
So one of those like a nice
ironic ending things and she

01:27:42.950 --> 01:27:45.750
didn't like trip him up
or something like that

01:27:45.750 --> 01:27:47.860
as she perhaps might
have considered.

01:27:47.860 --> 01:27:49.260
So Judith Rich Harris.

01:27:49.260 --> 01:27:53.850
So her basic argument is that
peer socialization is really,

01:27:53.850 --> 01:27:56.150
really one of the
most powerful things.

01:27:56.150 --> 01:27:58.100
And where she
begins her argument

01:27:58.100 --> 01:28:00.980
is one which, as soon
as you think about it,

01:28:00.980 --> 01:28:02.790
is really striking.

01:28:02.790 --> 01:28:06.250
You look at children who are
growing up in a household

01:28:06.250 --> 01:28:09.230
where the home language
is a different one

01:28:09.230 --> 01:28:11.590
than the dominant
language in the culture.

01:28:11.590 --> 01:28:13.870
You're growing up in
an immigrant family.

01:28:13.870 --> 01:28:18.430
And what the studies show
is by age four or five

01:28:18.430 --> 01:28:22.870
you were developing the accent
of the community around you,

01:28:22.870 --> 01:28:24.390
of your peer groups.

01:28:24.390 --> 01:28:26.920
By age four or five
you were already

01:28:26.920 --> 01:28:30.960
beginning to become embarrassed
by your parent's accent.

01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:33.400
By age four or five
you were beginning

01:28:33.400 --> 01:28:36.760
to answer their questions
or their conversation

01:28:36.760 --> 01:28:38.840
in the home language
and answering it

01:28:38.840 --> 01:28:40.440
in the outside language.

01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:43.210
This occurs at an
amazingly early age.

01:28:43.210 --> 01:28:44.800
And as soon as you
think about it, oh,

01:28:44.800 --> 01:28:48.960
of course, somebody whose
parents are from Maine

01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:50.889
but they grew up
down in Louisiana,

01:28:50.889 --> 01:28:52.930
they're not going to grow
up with a Maine accent.

01:28:52.930 --> 01:28:56.070
They may be able to mimic
their parents very readily.

01:28:56.070 --> 01:28:59.110
But they're going to
develop a regional accent.

01:28:59.110 --> 01:29:02.100
People pick up the accents
of their peer group,

01:29:02.100 --> 01:29:03.310
not of their parents.

01:29:03.310 --> 01:29:05.920
So she uses that sort of
as the jumping off point

01:29:05.920 --> 01:29:09.170
for beginning to argue all the
different ways in which peer

01:29:09.170 --> 01:29:10.930
groups are the
things that matter.

01:29:10.930 --> 01:29:12.980
And at the end of
the day what parents

01:29:12.980 --> 01:29:16.840
are mostly good for is
determining what peer groups

01:29:16.840 --> 01:29:18.920
kids have access to.

01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:20.770
Sort of evidence she would show.

01:29:20.770 --> 01:29:23.300
And this begins
the whole world of

01:29:23.300 --> 01:29:27.040
conformity and conventionalized
behavior by groups.

01:29:27.040 --> 01:29:29.880
This begins a whole world
of the studies where

01:29:29.880 --> 01:29:34.120
showing you arbitrarily break
kids into groups by age group

01:29:34.120 --> 01:29:36.720
and they start having
disparaging beliefs

01:29:36.720 --> 01:29:37.960
about the other group.

01:29:37.960 --> 01:29:40.640
This is suddenly
Zimbardo studies.

01:29:40.640 --> 01:29:43.120
This is suddenly put
people arbitrarily

01:29:43.120 --> 01:29:45.810
into one category
or role and they

01:29:45.810 --> 01:29:47.930
begin to over identify
with that group.

01:29:47.930 --> 01:29:51.160
Here is one of the greatest
bits of evidence for peer

01:29:51.160 --> 01:29:52.840
socialization I've ever heard.

01:29:52.840 --> 01:29:56.170
And this was documented in at
least two different people's

01:29:56.170 --> 01:29:56.900
memoirs.

01:29:56.900 --> 01:29:59.080
People who were
actors on the set

01:29:59.080 --> 01:30:03.580
of the original Planet of
the Apes movies in the 1960s.

01:30:03.580 --> 01:30:05.310
And what they noted--
I think you could

01:30:05.310 --> 01:30:08.220
either there, besides being one
of the three or four humans,

01:30:08.220 --> 01:30:09.920
you could either be
a chimp or a gorilla

01:30:09.920 --> 01:30:12.810
or an orangutan all of
which were not anatomically

01:30:12.810 --> 01:30:14.900
correct or politically correct.

01:30:14.900 --> 01:30:17.420
But what they wound
up seeing there

01:30:17.420 --> 01:30:19.340
was two of these
people in their memoirs

01:30:19.340 --> 01:30:23.130
noted that by the first week
of filming having happened

01:30:23.130 --> 01:30:25.805
people sat at lunch
separated by species.

01:30:25.805 --> 01:30:26.780
[LAUGHTER]

01:30:26.780 --> 01:30:29.730
All of the actors who
were chimps ate together.

01:30:29.730 --> 01:30:33.150
All of the onee-- and these
were people who had friends,

01:30:33.150 --> 01:30:36.120
some of their best friends
were orangutans and things

01:30:36.120 --> 01:30:38.320
of that sort who they
had known for years.

01:30:38.320 --> 01:30:40.210
But two different
people's memoirs

01:30:40.210 --> 01:30:42.830
noting sort of-- who were
actors in that-- noting

01:30:42.830 --> 01:30:45.780
this bizarre thing that
emerged that people would only

01:30:45.780 --> 01:30:48.340
have lunch with their
other primate species.

01:30:48.340 --> 01:30:51.760
So that presumably
vindicates everything

01:30:51.760 --> 01:30:53.620
that Judith Rich Harris says.

01:30:53.620 --> 01:30:57.080
So what she has done is
reinterpret certain findings.

01:30:57.080 --> 01:31:00.330
For example, showing that one
of the things that you find

01:31:00.330 --> 01:31:02.500
is kids growing up,
boys growing up,

01:31:02.500 --> 01:31:05.030
in households without
a father have a higher

01:31:05.030 --> 01:31:09.300
chance of anti-social violence
as an adult. And what she does

01:31:09.300 --> 01:31:11.780
is take apart that
literature and shows

01:31:11.780 --> 01:31:15.730
that what the actual variable
is, is that boys growing up

01:31:15.730 --> 01:31:18.170
in families without a
father, single parent

01:31:18.170 --> 01:31:21.500
households, single mother,
they are more likely to live

01:31:21.500 --> 01:31:23.190
in a poorer neighborhood.

01:31:23.190 --> 01:31:26.500
And it is, in fact, the peer
socialization there which

01:31:26.500 --> 01:31:28.090
is the driving force on it.

01:31:28.090 --> 01:31:30.250
Fancy statistics to show that.

01:31:30.250 --> 01:31:32.710
That's the sort of
argument she makes.

01:31:32.710 --> 01:31:35.510
Finally, one of the
most interesting studies

01:31:35.510 --> 01:31:37.370
that's ever occurred
in this realm

01:31:37.370 --> 01:31:39.220
came out about 15 years ago.

01:31:39.220 --> 01:31:42.060
One law professor here at
Stanford and one economist

01:31:42.060 --> 01:31:46.720
at University of Chicago making
a very interesting argument

01:31:46.720 --> 01:31:50.480
as a predictor of criminal
behavior in people.

01:31:50.480 --> 01:31:53.220
And what these two did,
Levitt and Donahue, they

01:31:53.220 --> 01:31:55.200
dealt with what
was then emerging

01:31:55.200 --> 01:31:58.630
as a really interesting
sociological phenomenon which

01:31:58.630 --> 01:32:01.430
was that somewhere
since the late 1980s,

01:32:01.430 --> 01:32:04.330
the crime rate in this
country has been plummeting.

01:32:04.330 --> 01:32:06.030
Every city, every state.

01:32:06.030 --> 01:32:07.380
It's been going way down.

01:32:07.380 --> 01:32:09.570
And for years people
have been wrestling with,

01:32:09.570 --> 01:32:12.790
what's going on the decreased
crime rate in general?

01:32:12.790 --> 01:32:15.830
If you have a more conservative
bent which you would emphasize

01:32:15.830 --> 01:32:19.240
is building of more prisons
during this period, three

01:32:19.240 --> 01:32:21.805
strike laws, things
like that that

01:32:21.805 --> 01:32:25.480
have put in more institutional
punishment, more policing.

01:32:25.480 --> 01:32:28.430
If you have a more liberal
bent, what you emphasize

01:32:28.430 --> 01:32:31.410
is how good the economy
was during the '90s.

01:32:31.410 --> 01:32:33.480
But that winds up
being problematic

01:32:33.480 --> 01:32:34.980
because the crime
rate has continued

01:32:34.980 --> 01:32:37.140
to drop over the last
three, four years

01:32:37.140 --> 01:32:39.020
amid the economy tanking.

01:32:39.020 --> 01:32:41.890
All these various explanations
explain a bit of it,

01:32:41.890 --> 01:32:44.900
but what these guys
argued was as follows.

01:32:44.900 --> 01:32:46.470
That the decreased
crime rate that

01:32:46.470 --> 01:32:49.380
started in the United
States in the late 1980s

01:32:49.380 --> 01:32:53.290
was due to Roe v. Wade.

01:32:53.290 --> 01:32:55.220
Here's what they would show.

01:32:55.220 --> 01:33:00.090
They would show that as each
state would legalize abortion,

01:33:00.090 --> 01:33:03.390
you would have about a
12 to 15 year lag time

01:33:03.390 --> 01:33:06.390
before you would start to
have the crime rate drop.

01:33:06.390 --> 01:33:09.090
The crime rate during
the first five years

01:33:09.090 --> 01:33:11.380
of the crime rate
dropping would entirely

01:33:11.380 --> 01:33:15.400
be due to fewer teenagers
entering the criminal justice

01:33:15.400 --> 01:33:16.200
system.

01:33:16.200 --> 01:33:19.060
By the time it was a
decade and a half or so

01:33:19.060 --> 01:33:21.740
past Roe versus-- past
that first point--

01:33:21.740 --> 01:33:25.140
the drop in crime rate was
entirely due to fewer 15

01:33:25.140 --> 01:33:26.180
to 30-year-olds.

01:33:26.180 --> 01:33:28.732
And it just marched out
from there state by state.

01:33:28.732 --> 01:33:31.190
What their numbers showed when
they did what were currently

01:33:31.190 --> 01:33:33.600
some pretty fancy
convincing statistics

01:33:33.600 --> 01:33:37.080
was that Roe versus Wade
accounted for about 50%

01:33:37.080 --> 01:33:38.720
of the drop in crime.

01:33:38.720 --> 01:33:40.290
What's that telling you?

01:33:40.290 --> 01:33:43.890
One of the most depressing
things I can imagine,

01:33:43.890 --> 01:33:47.740
which is a huge, huge
predictor of growing up

01:33:47.740 --> 01:33:50.660
to be a violent
antisocial individual

01:33:50.660 --> 01:33:54.800
is having been born when
nobody wanted you to be born.

01:33:54.800 --> 01:33:58.790
And what Roe v. Wade, what
the ability to have abortions,

01:33:58.790 --> 01:34:00.840
introduced in much
of the country

01:34:00.840 --> 01:34:04.200
at that time-- introduced
was the ability of someone

01:34:04.200 --> 01:34:06.970
to not have a child who
they didn't want to have.

01:34:06.970 --> 01:34:09.560
Being born to a mother who
doesn't want to have you,

01:34:09.560 --> 01:34:12.250
that turns out to be a pretty
big predictor of life not going

01:34:12.250 --> 01:34:14.260
well after that.

01:34:14.260 --> 01:34:15.240
Final piece.

01:34:15.240 --> 01:34:17.810
Final piece in
this, which is now

01:34:17.810 --> 01:34:19.990
when you look at all
of this development

01:34:19.990 --> 01:34:22.360
and aggression and
moral whatevers,

01:34:22.360 --> 01:34:25.060
what does it wind up
looking like in adulthood?

01:34:25.060 --> 01:34:27.760
What this translates into
is asking the question,

01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:32.490
how much does one stage of
Kohlbergian moral development

01:34:32.490 --> 01:34:35.480
actually predict who
does something moral?

01:34:35.480 --> 01:34:38.470
In other words, is
there a good correlation

01:34:38.470 --> 01:34:41.870
between moral reasoning
and moral behavior?

01:34:41.870 --> 01:34:44.640
And what the literature
is absolutely clear on

01:34:44.640 --> 01:34:47.600
is there's not a
particularly good connection.

01:34:47.600 --> 01:34:51.670
You've got some fancy dancy
post-conventional transcendent

01:34:51.670 --> 01:34:55.630
Kohlbergian stage and you even
have a certificate to prove it.

01:34:55.630 --> 01:34:57.960
And that's not
remotely a predictor

01:34:57.960 --> 01:35:01.020
of you being more likely
to be the person who

01:35:01.020 --> 01:35:04.990
steps out of the anonymous crowd
and saves the drowning child.

01:35:04.990 --> 01:35:07.250
There's no connection
with Kohlberg stage.

01:35:07.250 --> 01:35:09.400
Having the fancier
Kohlberg stage

01:35:09.400 --> 01:35:12.530
is a pretty good predictor that
you'll be a moral philosophy

01:35:12.530 --> 01:35:15.260
professor of an Ivy League
college instead of a state

01:35:15.260 --> 01:35:15.940
school.

01:35:15.940 --> 01:35:18.540
If you're stuck in an
earlier Kohlbergian stage,

01:35:18.540 --> 01:35:21.380
it's a very abstract
academic measure.

01:35:21.380 --> 01:35:24.140
It is not a predictor
at all over who

01:35:24.140 --> 01:35:28.390
will do the truly brave,
unexpected moral acts.

01:35:28.390 --> 01:35:30.070
So what's of that about?

01:35:30.070 --> 01:35:33.830
That taps into something that I
think we've already alluded to

01:35:33.830 --> 01:35:38.400
in here, which is certain ways
in which information is stored,

01:35:38.400 --> 01:35:40.690
certain places in the
brain that information

01:35:40.690 --> 01:35:43.310
is stored as follows.

01:35:43.310 --> 01:35:46.640
So there is this
dichotomy in sort

01:35:46.640 --> 01:35:49.750
of the neurobiology of
learning between what

01:35:49.750 --> 01:35:54.690
is viewed as explicit
learning and implicit.

01:35:54.690 --> 01:36:00.450
Explicit declarative learning,
implicit procedural learning.

01:36:00.450 --> 01:36:03.890
Explicit declarative
learning is you learn a fact.

01:36:03.890 --> 01:36:05.200
You know a fact.

01:36:05.200 --> 01:36:06.670
You know that the fact.

01:36:06.670 --> 01:36:08.890
You can consciously
make use of the fact

01:36:08.890 --> 01:36:12.170
and strategize and use
it in an executive way.

01:36:12.170 --> 01:36:14.710
Implicit procedural
memory instead

01:36:14.710 --> 01:36:17.480
is stuff that, as always
termed, your hands

01:36:17.480 --> 01:36:19.600
know better than your head does.

01:36:19.600 --> 01:36:22.050
How to do stuff with your hands.

01:36:22.050 --> 01:36:24.840
The other day sort of showing
that in terms of damage

01:36:24.840 --> 01:36:26.510
to the amygdala and
the frontal cortex

01:36:26.510 --> 01:36:28.590
in people with
Alzheimer's disease.

01:36:28.590 --> 01:36:31.760
Explicit declarative
memory goes down the tubes.

01:36:31.760 --> 01:36:33.890
But this is the person
who can still knit.

01:36:33.890 --> 01:36:35.870
This is the person who
could still drive a car.

01:36:35.870 --> 01:36:37.130
Things of that sort.

01:36:37.130 --> 01:36:40.060
Procedural implicit
memory is not

01:36:40.060 --> 01:36:42.330
stored in the
hippocampus and cortex.

01:36:42.330 --> 01:36:46.250
It is predominantly a
phenomenon of the cerebellum.

01:36:46.250 --> 01:36:50.360
So you look at the people
who do the profoundly brave

01:36:50.360 --> 01:36:52.800
stepping out of the crowd steps.

01:36:52.800 --> 01:36:56.670
They're the ones who, regardless
of what their Kohlbergian stage

01:36:56.670 --> 01:36:59.710
might be on their essays that
they write for college finals,

01:36:59.710 --> 01:37:02.310
when you look at the people
who actually do something

01:37:02.310 --> 01:37:06.220
what you see are two factors
that consistently come up.

01:37:06.220 --> 01:37:09.160
And this has mostly been studied
by the Carnegie Foundation

01:37:09.160 --> 01:37:11.270
that every year gives
out awards for the most

01:37:11.270 --> 01:37:12.640
heroic acts of the years.

01:37:12.640 --> 01:37:14.950
And they've actually studied
who these people are,

01:37:14.950 --> 01:37:16.410
what the differences are.

01:37:16.410 --> 01:37:19.390
The first one is that
you have grown up

01:37:19.390 --> 01:37:22.660
with a very strong,
consistent, frequently

01:37:22.660 --> 01:37:27.620
stated imperative to act
morally and to act bravely

01:37:27.620 --> 01:37:30.820
and to not care what
other people think.

01:37:30.820 --> 01:37:32.890
That's the first
thing that you see.

01:37:32.890 --> 01:37:35.410
And the second thing
that always pops up

01:37:35.410 --> 01:37:39.660
is one that is the complete
neurobiological logical outcome

01:37:39.660 --> 01:37:43.170
of that, which is when they
then interview these people

01:37:43.170 --> 01:37:45.610
and say you leapt
out of this crowd

01:37:45.610 --> 01:37:47.240
and ran into this
burning building

01:37:47.240 --> 01:37:49.620
and almost got yourself
killed to save this child who

01:37:49.620 --> 01:37:54.200
you didn't even know, what were
you thinking when you did it?

01:37:54.200 --> 01:37:57.010
And people's answer
is always the same.

01:37:57.010 --> 01:37:58.160
I wasn't thinking.

01:37:58.160 --> 01:37:59.340
I didn't think.

01:37:59.340 --> 01:38:02.220
Before I knew it,
I had run in there.

01:38:02.220 --> 01:38:05.450
Before I knew it, I had
leapt into the river.

01:38:05.450 --> 01:38:06.885
What are we looking at here?

01:38:06.885 --> 01:38:09.830
We are looking at
a moral act not as

01:38:09.830 --> 01:38:12.940
the outcome of your frontal
cortex wrestling you

01:38:12.940 --> 01:38:16.010
into being brave and
moral and all of that.

01:38:16.010 --> 01:38:18.960
You were looking at
an implicit pathway.

01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:21.380
You were looking
at, I didn't think.

01:38:21.380 --> 01:38:24.510
Before I knew it I have
leapt in the river.

01:38:24.510 --> 01:38:27.380
You were looking at what
happens when something is over

01:38:27.380 --> 01:38:29.290
learned during childhood.

01:38:29.290 --> 01:38:32.110
It is not something that you
have to sit and consciously

01:38:32.110 --> 01:38:33.460
wrestle with.

01:38:33.460 --> 01:38:37.150
Fascinating paper a few months
ago from that same Josh Greene

01:38:37.150 --> 01:38:39.230
who did that trolley car study.

01:38:39.230 --> 01:38:43.290
And here what he did was people
were playing some sort of game

01:38:43.290 --> 01:38:44.974
where they had to
predict an outcome

01:38:44.974 --> 01:38:47.140
and they would get a reward
if they predicted right.

01:38:47.140 --> 01:38:50.660
And they set it up in some
totally clever duplicitous way

01:38:50.660 --> 01:38:52.720
so that there would
be periods in the game

01:38:52.720 --> 01:38:55.770
where the person had
the option to cheat.

01:38:55.770 --> 01:38:58.830
And they were able to tell by
the rate at which they were

01:38:58.830 --> 01:39:01.520
suddenly getting better
answers if during these periods

01:39:01.520 --> 01:39:03.930
suddenly they were being
statistically significantly

01:39:03.930 --> 01:39:06.420
more successful
they were cheating.

01:39:06.420 --> 01:39:07.920
And they had them
in a brain scanner

01:39:07.920 --> 01:39:09.860
and were able to see
what was going on.

01:39:09.860 --> 01:39:12.280
So you look at people
who would cheat

01:39:12.280 --> 01:39:14.220
and what happens
when the signal comes

01:39:14.220 --> 01:39:17.030
on indicating that it's one of
these sessions where they could

01:39:17.030 --> 01:39:18.530
get away with cheating.

01:39:18.530 --> 01:39:22.690
Their frontal cortexes
lit up like crazy.

01:39:22.690 --> 01:39:24.200
What were they doing?

01:39:24.200 --> 01:39:26.280
They were wrestling with Satan.

01:39:26.280 --> 01:39:30.230
They were asking those neurons
to do something or other down

01:39:30.230 --> 01:39:33.820
in the amygdala before they did
the wrong thing and the degree

01:39:33.820 --> 01:39:37.380
of frontal activation was not
particularly predictive of who

01:39:37.380 --> 01:39:38.750
actually did cheat.

01:39:38.750 --> 01:39:40.350
You fell into the
cheater category

01:39:40.350 --> 01:39:42.920
if they could show that you ever
cheated during one of these.

01:39:42.920 --> 01:39:44.930
And thus looking at you
the rest of a time when

01:39:44.930 --> 01:39:47.680
you had the opportunity and
didn't, it wasn't particularly

01:39:47.680 --> 01:39:50.000
good predictor of whether
you cheated or not.

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.670
But it was a great
predictor of people who were

01:39:52.670 --> 01:39:55.120
willing to even cheat once.

01:39:55.120 --> 01:39:58.580
So now look at the people
who never ever cheated

01:39:58.580 --> 01:40:00.210
and, of course, one
prediction would

01:40:00.210 --> 01:40:03.050
be that they have
like frontal neurons

01:40:03.050 --> 01:40:06.270
poking out of their head
that are so big and energized

01:40:06.270 --> 01:40:09.770
and their frontal cortex
didn't move an inch.

01:40:09.770 --> 01:40:12.410
When the possibility
of cheating came up,

01:40:12.410 --> 01:40:16.100
there wasn't the remotest
change in frontal activation.

01:40:16.100 --> 01:40:19.220
This was not them wrestling
Satan to the ground.

01:40:19.220 --> 01:40:20.390
It wasn't there.

01:40:20.390 --> 01:40:22.100
There was no temptation.

01:40:22.100 --> 01:40:24.260
It was an implicit pathway.

01:40:24.260 --> 01:40:27.395
It was not sitting there saying,
oh, what if everyone did this?

01:40:27.395 --> 01:40:29.145
And, oh, it's important
that we have laws.

01:40:29.145 --> 01:40:32.900
And, oh, what if I get
punished or-- it is simply,

01:40:32.900 --> 01:40:35.140
before I knew it,
I had jumped in.

01:40:35.140 --> 01:40:36.920
I didn't even think about it.

01:40:36.920 --> 01:40:40.050
What I think this suggests
is awful lot of what

01:40:40.050 --> 01:40:43.480
moral development is about
in the formal stage world

01:40:43.480 --> 01:40:45.310
is what kind of
frontal cortex you're

01:40:45.310 --> 01:40:47.850
going to wind up with
reasoning with your amygdala

01:40:47.850 --> 01:40:49.710
when you look at
the dissociation

01:40:49.710 --> 01:40:52.110
between moral reasoning
and moral behavior

01:40:52.110 --> 01:40:55.240
and the ones who do
the truly brave things,

01:40:55.240 --> 01:40:57.920
it's got nothing to do
with the frontal cortex.

01:40:57.920 --> 01:41:00.250
It's implicit by them.

01:41:00.250 --> 01:41:04.941
So we will pick up
on-- what day is it?

01:41:04.941 --> 01:41:05.440
Wednesday.

01:41:05.440 --> 01:41:07.060
Today's Wednesday?

01:41:07.060 --> 01:41:10.310

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.940
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:05.860
Stanford University.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.730
This is BIO 150, isn't it?

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.470
OK, just wanted to make sure.

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.890
So we start off with a scenario.

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.950
40-year-old guy--
quiet, suburban life.

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:27.060
Married 15 years,
two kids, 3.5 dogs.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.200
Everything's standard.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.860
Everything's going wonderfully.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.600
And one day out of nowhere,
he punches somebody

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.420
in the face at work.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.590
Totally bizarre,
out of character.

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.480
The guy is standing
there by the water cooler

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.950
and makes some comment
on some baseball team,

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.640
takes exception to it,
punches him in the face.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.730
Utterly strange.

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.150
Things are quiet.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.390
Three months later, his wife
of 15 years happy marriage

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.650
discovers he's having an affair
with a 16-year-old checkout

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.770
kid down at the Safeway.

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:58.990
Really weird.

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:02.280
Then three months
after that, he absconds

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.760
with all the money at work,
embezzles it, disappears,

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.860
and is never seen again.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.490
Three possibilities.

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.690
First one-- this guy
is a truly deep creep.

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.620
Second, he is having the
most immature midlife

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.820
crisis you could ever imagine.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.300
Third possibility--
he has a mutation

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.870
in one gene in his head.

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:24.820
And what we will
be seeing is this

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.960
is exactly the
profile that you get

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.150
in a certain
neurological disease

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.950
where it's one gene
that's out of whack.

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.680
First demonstration of that.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.520
OK, just to get a
sense of who's here,

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.120
how many of you think there
is a genetic influence

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.860
on sexual orientation?

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.990
OK, how many think it is
possible for prenatal events

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.500
to influence your political
opinions 30 years later?

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.220
OK, how many think that there
is a valid way of using biology

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.470
to understand who's
religious and who isn't?

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.100
Not quite as many hands there.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.060
OK, as long as we're
in that terrain,

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.389
how many people believe in God?

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:12.852
How many people
believe in souls?

00:02:12.852 --> 00:02:14.185
How many people believe in evil?

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.592
How many people
believe in free will?

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.690
That's going to change.

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.420
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.730
Oh, I might as well ask.

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.930
Is there anybody in
this room who actually

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.046
does believe in evolution?

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:36.720
Just wanted to make sure.

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.260
See what we're
dealing with here.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.890
OK, how many think that
there is a genetic influence

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.100
and that there is a basic
biological difference, sex

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.040
difference, in
levels of aggression?

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.564
How many think there's
biological basis of sex

00:02:51.564 --> 00:02:52.730
differences in intelligence?

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.060
OK, who thinks it's all
explained by nature?

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.895
Who thinks it's all
explained by nurture?

00:03:02.895 --> 00:03:06.120
Who thinks there's a
magnificent, fascinating,

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.600
nuanced interaction
between nature and nurture?

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:09.920
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:10.990
Yay.

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.360
OK, well everybody's
going to get an A+ then.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.060
You already have the
course under control.

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:22.020
So we start off trying to
find something in common.

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:27.100
Look at these four
events here-- or not,

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.720
in terms of being
scraped out there.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.680
But these are four
circumstances that have

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.310
something surprising in common.

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.780
Having your period.

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.190
Having a brain tumor.

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.640
Eating a lot of junk food.

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.466
Taking anabolic steroids.

00:03:42.466 --> 00:03:43.840
Those of you who
are not oriented

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.964
to with, that's the ones
that build up your muscles

00:03:45.964 --> 00:03:47.950
like testosterone derivatives.

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.210
OK, these all have something
in common-- having your period,

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:53.970
having a brain tumor,
eating a lot of junk food,

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.810
and taking a lot of
anabolic steroids.

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.660
Anybody want to fathom a
guess what's the commonality

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.670
amongst the four of them?

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:02.170
Yeah.

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:03.590
Hormones?

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:04.220
Hormones.

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.720
Good.

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.070
OK, we're off and
running with hormones.

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.620
Good.

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.190
Even more specific than that.

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:13.530
Something they all
have in common.

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.680
Oh, come on, somebody
want to guess?

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.800
I see these brief
movements of hands

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.520
there as people
change their mind.

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.430
OK, it all has to
do with hormones.

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:26.860
They all have
hormones in common,

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.972
I say, trying to facilitate
somebody making the next guess.

00:04:29.972 --> 00:04:30.472
Oh, come on.

00:04:30.472 --> 00:04:32.330
They all have something.

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.220
OK, we gotta get outta
here at some point.

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.490
These all have four
things in common.

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.170
All of these have been used
successfully in courts of law

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:44.510
to explain the
behavior of a murderer.

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:47.450
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:52.160
In the first case,
a number of cases

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.120
where the fact that
a woman was having

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.600
her period at the time
of killing someone

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.750
was part of what a jury said led
them to exonerate the person.

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.730
A literature showing that
a disproportionate share

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:08.660
of female aggression comes
around the time of menses.

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.600
Next one-- there is an area of
the brain you will know so much

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.580
about over the next three
months called the amygdala

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.160
that has something
to do with aggression

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.120
and has something
to do with fear.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.510
And you get a brain tumor
there, and in a number of cases,

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:26.890
you get someone who is
uncontrollably violent.

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:30.840
And this has also been used
successfully in a court of law.

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.780
Junk food-- any of you who are
San Francisco history buffs

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:37.692
will know 20 years
ago, 30 years ago

00:05:37.692 --> 00:05:41.060
that Dan White, a
disappointed office seeker,

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:44.130
assassinated the mayor of San
Francisco along with Harvey

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:44.810
Milk.

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:48.490
And as part of his
remarkably successful defense

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:51.730
for a double murderer that
led to a remarkably short jail

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:54.920
sentence, was the
famed Twinkie defense.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:58.370
The argument that his
addiction to junk food

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:01.530
caused wild fluctuations
in his blood sugar levels,

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:03.670
which caused him to do that.

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:06.040
Finally, anabolic steroids.

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:09.350
Any number of cases of people
having uncontrolled violence

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:12.630
arguing because they were
weight lifters and a wildly

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:14.630
abusive range of
taking this stuff

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:16.780
had something to
do with violence.

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:18.920
Put all four of these
together, and we

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:22.280
get the first of the two
points of this entire course.

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:26.700
Which is, sometimes the stuff
that's going on in your body

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:30.640
can dramatically influence
what goes on in your brain.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:34.380
Second critical point-- tonight,
when you've settled back down,

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:37.160
and you're ready to go to sleep,
and you're nice and relaxed,

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.000
and your heart's
beating nice and slow,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.840
think the following thought.

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:45.590
You know, that heart isn't
going to beat forever.

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:49.040
Think about your lips
turning blue after.

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.470
Think about the blood
flow slowing down.

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:54.090
Think about your feet and
your toes getting cold.

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:56.390
And at that point,
you will probably

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:59.510
be increasing the rate at
which that heart beats.

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:01.740
And you will have just
seen the second key thing

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:04.280
in this course,
which is sometimes

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:06.230
what's going on
in your head will

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:09.100
affect every single
outpost in your body.

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:12.460
And what this course is
about is the intertwining,

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:15.680
the interconnections
between your physiology

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.990
and your behavior-- the
underlying emotions,

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:22.210
thoughts, memories, all of
that, and the capacity of each

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:25.270
to deeply influence the
other under all sorts

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:27.089
of circumstances.

00:07:27.089 --> 00:07:28.880
Now, what we're going
to be doing with this

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:31.420
is trying to understand
this under fairly

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:32.990
difficult circumstances.

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:36.200
If everybody here was
here because they really

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:39.450
wanted to understand why
all the wildebeest on earth

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:42.110
mate in the same
week each year, we'd

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:44.670
have a fighting chance
of figuring that one out.

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:46.630
But that's not what
we want to understand.

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:48.550
We don't want to
understand why birds

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:50.090
migrate and don't get lost.

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:53.300
We want to understand
human behavior.

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:57.060
Worse than that, harder than
that, human social behavior.

00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:00.800
And hardest of all in some
cases, some grossly abnormal

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.170
human behavior.

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:04.630
And if you're going to
try to do that, there

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:08.290
is a problem which is,
officially, it's complicated.

00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:10.700
It is a huge, messy
process trying

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:14.540
to make sense of the biology
of human social behavior.

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:17.240
And just as all
sorts of realms when

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:20.170
one deals with messy,
complicated problems

00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:23.950
that you need to think about
in some wildly interacting way,

00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:27.290
we all have a strategy
that we come up with.

00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:30.240
A strategy to make
things easier-- which

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:33.059
is that we think in categories.

00:08:33.059 --> 00:08:34.289
We think in categories.

00:08:34.289 --> 00:08:36.780
We take things
that are continua,

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:38.990
and we break them
into categories.

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:41.250
And we label those categories.

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:43.690
And we do that in
various settings

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:46.100
because it could be
extremely useful.

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:51.270
For example, somebody give
me an estimate on how long

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:52.254
this line is.

00:08:52.254 --> 00:08:52.754
[INAUDIBLE]

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:56.380
A foot.

00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:59.240
OK, people who said a
foot, what is it that

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:02.300
went through your
head to figure it out?

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:05.920
You imagined how
long a ruler is.

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:11.140
Is this 11.5 inches because and
it's 11 inches-- an 8.5 by 11.

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:15.920
But everybody in here has this
category in their head things

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:19.010
that are kind of the
same length as a ruler.

00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:22.350
A continua of lengths, and
there's a category for that.

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:25.690
Suppose I'm telling you I have
some friend who's a runner.

00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:26.780
He runs the mile.

00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:28.270
He's incredibly fast.

00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:29.870
In fact, he's one
of the best runners

00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:31.260
in the country at this point.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:34.700
How fast does he have to have
run the mile or better for you

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:36.780
to be deeply impressed?

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:38.060
Under four minutes.

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:40.680
And thus, we have another
categorical boundary

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:44.030
there of there's an
infinite variety of speeds

00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:45.980
with which you can run a mile.

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:48.880
Yet we have in our heads
this boundary-- people

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:51.170
who are under four
minute milers,

00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:53.340
you are very impressed with.

00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:56.180
OK, now I want to impress you
with another friend of mine

00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:57.190
who's a painter.

00:09:57.190 --> 00:09:59.790
And this person is
such a great painter

00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:03.530
that they paint with
11 different colors.

00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:06.760
That doesn't work because that's
not a category that we have.

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:09.860
We don't classify the
quality-- hopefully

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:14.330
not-- we don't classify quality
of paintings along those lines.

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:17.770
But we begin to see here
is in the right areas,

00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:21.020
we have categories that
we impose on things

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:23.230
that are not categorical.

00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:24.430
Here's an example.

00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:26.210
Why should you do this?

00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:27.420
Where'd the example go?

00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:29.710
Here's one of the
classic continua

00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:32.750
that we ever deal with, which
is the continua of color--

00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:36.100
the varying wavelengths that
take the rainbow from violet

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:36.630
to red.

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:39.610
And there's an infinite
number of spaces in between.

00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:40.880
And what do we do?

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:44.450
We have rules in English that
you can divide the continua

00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:49.790
here and here, or whatever, and
that's what you call a color.

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:50.480
This is red.

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:52.010
Everything from here is red.

00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:54.130
Everything here
is orange, so on.

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:57.860
You take a continua, and you
break it into boundaries.

00:10:57.860 --> 00:10:59.220
Why do we do that?

00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:03.230
Because it makes it easier to
store the information away.

00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:06.190
Instead of remembering the
absolute features of something,

00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:08.302
you simply say, it's a.

00:11:08.302 --> 00:11:10.800
It's a sub-four minute miler.

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:14.240
It's a line that's about
the length of a ruler.

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:16.290
It's the color orange.

00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:18.000
How do you know that's the case?

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.890
Because go and take people
from other language groups,

00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:24.480
where their language
arbitrarily divides the rainbow

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:27.300
at other points with completely
different color terms,

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:31.710
and they remember different
profiles of colors differently

00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:33.750
than an English speaker might.

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:34.820
Take a color.

00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:40.000
And if the color comes right in
the center of somebody's color

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.550
characterization,
if it comes right

00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:45.670
in the middle of the range
of what counts as that color,

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:49.590
people remember whether they
saw that color or not far better

00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:52.220
than if you show them a
color at the boundary.

00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:55.270
And people will show that as
a function of what language

00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:56.130
they speak.

00:11:56.130 --> 00:11:59.020
Taking a continua, and
you break it into pieces,

00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:01.550
because it's easier to
deal with the facts.

00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:02.630
Another example of it.

00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:05.290
Here we have four objects.

00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:09.230
And as drawn here, simply
because we have categories

00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:11.410
to describe the
first three, do one

00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:14.044
of those tests of show
people a bunch of shapes,

00:12:14.044 --> 00:12:15.960
and they come back an
hour later and ask them,

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:17.570
Have you seen this shape before?

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:20.640
And people are going to be
far more accurate with this

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:23.120
than whether they saw
this or not because we

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:24.310
don't have a word for it.

00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:27.060
We don't have a word that's
at all sort of analytical

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:29.050
that some squiggly whatever.

00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:31.320
We don't have a
clear cut category.

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:34.140
Thinking in categories
makes it easier

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:36.130
for us to remember stuff.

00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:38.980
And it makes it easier
for us to evaluate stuff.

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:41.050
So that's a classic
sort of response

00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:44.340
that we have cognitively
to complicated things.

00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:48.730
But there's a bunch of problems
with categorical thinking.

00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:51.040
First example--
and first one you

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:54.230
can see from a realm of
language differences--

00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:57.160
in that not only is there a
continua of infinite number

00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:00.510
of wavelengths, there
is a continua of sounds

00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:02.160
that humans can make.

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:05.830
And different languages draw
boundaries at different points

00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:09.200
as to what count as similar
sounds or different sounds.

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:12.380
There's like two different
T-H sounds in English,

00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:15.000
which apparently we're
not very good at hearing.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.430
But there's other ones we are.

00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:18.870
And that will
affect your ability

00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:22.210
to remember stuff-- what
word it was-- depending on

00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:25.220
whether it is on a dramatically
different boundary, whether it

00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:27.860
is a sound that sounds
different to you or not.

00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:32.600
Example of this-- apparently
in Finnish, people

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:35.120
do not differentiate
between the sound of a B

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:38.370
and the sound of a P, whereas
we have no trouble with that.

00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:41.450
But people from Finland do
not make that differentiation.

00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:43.540
And I discovered this
one day a number of years

00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:46.840
ago where, for reasons
I don't even understand,

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:49.950
I found myself needing to
take to testicular biopsies

00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:52.310
on baboons.

00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:55.250
Not having sort of learned that
in junior high how you do that,

00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:57.610
I called up this guy at
urology the med school

00:13:57.610 --> 00:13:59.390
who happened to be Finnish.

00:13:59.390 --> 00:14:01.610
And I explained to him
what I wanted to do.

00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:03.470
And he sort of took
me through the paces

00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:07.750
and told me what thingy I needed
to buy, and that sort of stuff,

00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:10.750
and holiday packages of those
where you can get a dozen.

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:12.780
And sort of telling
me how to do that.

00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:15.800
And once we went through he
said, What I want you to do,

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:18.450
the thing to do at this
point, is get some practice.

00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:21.070
I want you to
practice on a bear.

00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:22.046
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:22.046 --> 00:14:24.720
And I said, What?

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:25.830
He said, Yeah.

00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:27.510
Practice on a bear.

00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:29.580
And I said, Are you kidding me?

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:30.520
He said, I know.

00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:33.570
I know it sounds crazy, but we
have all the residents do that.

00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:36.480
It's a very good
learning device.

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:40.460
Either practice on
a bear or an apple.

00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:41.810
Oh.

00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:42.710
Oh.

00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:45.650
Here we see the dangers
of making mistakes

00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:50.340
about differences between B and
P under certain circumstances.

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:52.930
So we see one of
the dangers there,

00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:56.940
which is when you are paying too
much attention to categories,

00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:59.180
you can't differentiate
two facts that

00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:01.390
fall within the same category.

00:15:01.390 --> 00:15:02.940
Next example.

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:06.350
I remember back at various
points of anxiety during exams,

00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:08.510
and such back when
where there was

00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:13.050
a world of difference between
getting a 65 on a test and a 66

00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:14.330
on a test.

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:15.730
Not particularly different.

00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:18.180
But because there is
this boundary drawn there

00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:21.710
between passing and failing,
there is this dramatic

00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:23.010
differentiating we make.

00:15:23.010 --> 00:15:24.880
When you put up
boundaries, you have

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:27.350
trouble seeing how
similar things are

00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:29.860
on either side of it.

00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:32.090
Next example, one
additional problem

00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:34.170
that you get when you
think categorically.

00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:36.420
And for this,
everybody needs to turn

00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:37.810
over one of the
pieces of paper--

00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:40.018
the paper you're going to
hand in, the questionnaire.

00:15:40.018 --> 00:15:44.160
And what I'm going to do is read
you a series of phone numbers,

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:46.840
and I want you to write them
down as accurately as possible.

00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:52.740
OK, ready?

00:15:52.740 --> 00:16:08.720
243-2649, 650-3260, 256-5779,
832-2449, 291-3171, 231-4026,

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:18.130
593-2449, 743-8840, 831-5287.

00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:19.190
OK.

00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:22.870
Now what that
exercise is-- and no,

00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:24.770
that doesn't count
towards the grade.

00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:27.060
What that will
show, I'm sure, when

00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:29.610
in some obsessive burst
of procrastination

00:16:29.610 --> 00:16:31.310
I actually look
through the answers

00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:34.520
tonight, what it's going
to show is the accuracy

00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:37.960
is going to tank the second
you go from the phone number

00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:42.040
pattern of three digits followed
by four, break up that pattern.

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:44.927
And suddenly we all get screwed
up because we're saying,

00:16:44.927 --> 00:16:45.510
Wait a second.

00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:46.843
I thought it was a phone number.

00:16:46.843 --> 00:16:47.760
That was one digit.

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:48.550
Now two digits.

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:49.050
I can't.

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:51.390
And it's gone, and you're
on to the next one.

00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:54.910
And what we see there is
the third example, which

00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:57.920
is when you pay too much
attention to boundaries,

00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:00.060
you don't see the big picture.

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:02.700
All you see are categories.

00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:05.270
All you see are, Wait
a second, phone numbers

00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:08.540
are supposed to come with
three digits followed by four.

00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:11.200
Another example where we
use categorical thinking.

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:13.285
OK, I'm putting up a
number series here.

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:21.359
OK.

00:17:21.359 --> 00:17:22.309
What's-- oh, my god.

00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:28.275
OK, what's the next
number in this series?

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:31.826
And why?

00:17:31.826 --> 00:17:34.380
[INAUDIBLE]

00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:35.750
42.

00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:36.351
How come?

00:17:36.351 --> 00:17:36.850
[INAUDIBLE]

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:47.420
OK, so we're kind of oscillating
all over the place there.

00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:51.470
OK, so that's as valid
as anybody else's.

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:53.396
Who else has a next
number in line there?

00:17:53.396 --> 00:17:54.070
[INAUDIBLE]

00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:54.666
What's that?

00:17:54.666 --> 00:17:55.440
[INAUDIBLE]

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:56.130
45.

00:17:56.130 --> 00:17:56.650
How come?

00:17:56.650 --> 00:17:57.150
[INAUDIBLE]

00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:03.880
OK.

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:06.540
Are you going to take that?

00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:07.230
45.

00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:08.090
That's very-- OK.

00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:08.670
What else?

00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:10.711
Let me make it a
little bit easier here.

00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:18.430
OK.

00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:20.720
So what's the next
number in that series?

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:23.400
And what I'm telling
you is if you think

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:27.714
about the world with a certain
set of categories in your head,

00:18:27.714 --> 00:18:29.630
you will know the next
number in the sequence.

00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:30.736
So what's the next one?

00:18:30.736 --> 00:18:32.600
[INAUDIBLE]

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:33.331
Seven billion.

00:18:33.331 --> 00:18:33.830
[INAUDIBLE]

00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:38.180
OK.

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:40.950
That one.

00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:41.450
OK.

00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:42.310
Seven billion.

00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:44.080
That's another possibility.

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:47.240
Although presumably, it
would be seven billionth.

00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:48.490
Anything else?

00:18:48.490 --> 00:18:51.980
Any other guesses here
as to what happens next?

00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:54.620
4th, 14th, 23rd, 34th.

00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:56.390
What's the next one
in the sequence yes?

00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:57.160
[INAUDIBLE]

00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:57.920
44.

00:18:57.920 --> 00:18:58.470
How come?

00:18:58.470 --> 00:18:58.970
[INAUDIBLE]

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:12.370
OK.

00:19:12.370 --> 00:19:15.781
But remember, it's
got to be 44th.

00:19:15.781 --> 00:19:16.280
What's that?

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:16.770
Ordinal?

00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:17.270
Cardinal?

00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:17.981
Whatever it is.

00:19:17.981 --> 00:19:18.480
What?

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:19.600
42nd.

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:20.140
How come?

00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:21.180
The subway?

00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:22.400
You were right.

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:23.850
You were right.

00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:29.960
Anybody who is a New Yorker
will know what the next one is.

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:31.780
These are the subway stops.

00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:33.760
And you get a bagel
with cream cheese.

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:43.290
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:46.340
So you get New Yorkers,
and while everybody else

00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:50.130
is thinking logical things
like 43, and 41, and 45,

00:19:50.130 --> 00:19:52.550
and seven billion,
and all of that,

00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:55.590
you've got this whole world
of dividing numbers by.

00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:56.910
Subway stops.

00:19:56.910 --> 00:19:58.470
We think in categories.

00:19:58.470 --> 00:19:59.900
We think in categories.

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:02.660
But as you just saw,
there are these problems.

00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:05.470
First one being, when
you think in categories,

00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:08.860
you underestimate how
different two facts are when

00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:10.920
they fall in the same category.

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:12.940
When you think in
categories, you

00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:15.260
overestimate how
different they are

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:18.020
when there happens to be a
boundary in between them.

00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:20.750
And when you pay attention
to categorical boundaries,

00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:22.920
you don't see big pictures.

00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:25.950
Now, what our goal in this
class is going to be is

00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:28.120
think about this
big, complex issue

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:30.770
of the biology of
behavior without falling

00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:32.800
into thinking in categories.

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:34.250
What do I mean in this regard?

00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:36.900
Thinking categorically
about a subject like this?

00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:39.740
There's some chicken.

00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:41.950
And the chicken is
standing somewhere.

00:20:41.950 --> 00:20:43.600
And there's some
rooster over there

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:47.460
that does some sexually
solicitive, exciting thing

00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:48.450
for the female.

00:20:48.450 --> 00:20:50.300
And in response to
that, the female

00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:53.280
picks up and goes running
over to the rooster.

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:56.090
And thus, we have our first
behavioral biology question

00:20:56.090 --> 00:20:56.590
here.

00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:58.810
Why did that chicken
cross the road?

00:20:58.810 --> 00:21:00.220
To get to that rooster.

00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:03.170
So you could answer that
like an endocrinologist

00:21:03.170 --> 00:21:05.890
and say, Well the female had
certain levels of estrogen

00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:08.620
in her bloodstream, which
made this key hypothalic areas

00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:10.070
responsive to the stimulus.

00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:12.550
Or you could answer
it like an anatomist,

00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:15.450
saying, Well, because
the fulcrum of her pelvis

00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:18.490
or whatever it is chickens
have that allow them to run.

00:21:18.490 --> 00:21:20.440
Or you could answer
it in the category

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:22.500
of an evolutionary biologist.

00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:24.720
That over the
millennia, chickens

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:27.810
that didn't respond to sexually
solicitive gesture from males

00:21:27.810 --> 00:21:29.760
left fewer copies
of their genes.

00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:31.850
And there's all these
different categories

00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:34.940
that we can use to
explain what's going on.

00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:37.140
All of these different buckets.

00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:38.910
All of these different
buckets which

00:21:38.910 --> 00:21:43.060
begin to pull you towards all
of the problems we just saw.

00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:46.610
Now, having trouble telling how
different or similar two facts

00:21:46.610 --> 00:21:47.120
are.

00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:49.320
Having trouble
seeing big pictures.

00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:52.120
Over emphasizing the
importance of the bucket

00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:54.010
you happen to live inside of.

00:21:54.010 --> 00:21:57.460
And thus, suddenly everything
about this behavior

00:21:57.460 --> 00:22:02.340
is explained by a gene, a
neurotransmitter, a childhood

00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:05.950
trauma, a living
inside one bucket.

00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:08.300
Whet we are going to be
doing over and over in here

00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:11.495
as the main point of the course
is looking at how what goes on

00:22:11.495 --> 00:22:14.760
in your body influences
behavior, emotions, memories.

00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:16.900
How what goes on there
influences your body,

00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:17.590
looping over.

00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:19.570
And at every one
of those points,

00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:22.820
resisting the pull to
think categorically.

00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:27.549
Oh, this is the explanation for
where this behavior came from.

00:22:27.549 --> 00:22:29.340
Here's what we're going
to be doing instead

00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:31.650
throughout in terms of
the structure of the class

00:22:31.650 --> 00:22:33.590
when we get to actual behaviors.

00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:37.160
For each behavioral
category, we will start off

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:39.900
by looking at what the
behavior looks like.

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:42.680
Because often, that takes
a lot more objectivity

00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:44.170
than we initially assume.

00:22:44.170 --> 00:22:46.120
What does the
behavior look like?

00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:49.520
Then we will say, Well, what
went on in that organism

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:53.380
a half second before
that behavior occurred

00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:54.810
to cause it to occur?

00:22:54.810 --> 00:22:57.640
Which is the world of what's
going on with neurons.

00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:59.630
What's going on with circuitry.

00:22:59.630 --> 00:23:02.460
Where's the explanation
for the behavior.

00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:02.980
Aha.

00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:06.010
This behavior happened
because this part of the brain

00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:07.680
got activated.

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:09.710
But just as we're about
to settle in happily

00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:11.980
into that bucket,
we push back a bit

00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:15.140
and say, Well, what
smell, what sound,

00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:18.150
what sensory stimulation
in the environment

00:23:18.150 --> 00:23:20.400
caused those neurons
to get activated

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:22.300
and produce that behavior?

00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:24.810
And then pushing one
step further behind.

00:23:24.810 --> 00:23:28.470
OK, well, what do hormone
levels, various hormones

00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:30.990
in the bloodstream of
that animal or individual

00:23:30.990 --> 00:23:33.790
for the past few hours,
how do those hormones

00:23:33.790 --> 00:23:37.280
change how sensitive you
are to those sounds, smells,

00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:39.270
et cetera, that
cause those neurons

00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:41.280
to get activated and
produce the behavior?

00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:44.560
And all we're going to be
doing is working our way back,

00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:47.550
all the way through early
development, fetal life,

00:23:47.550 --> 00:23:50.760
the genetic makeup up of an
individual, the genetic makeup

00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:54.330
up entire populations, species,
the evolutionary pressure

00:23:54.330 --> 00:23:56.650
on, all the way back to there.

00:23:56.650 --> 00:23:59.360
How do you explain each
one of these behaviors

00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:01.540
in the context of
those outposts?

00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:04.200
And how are they
not really outposts?

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:07.150
All they are, are different
ways of expressing

00:24:07.150 --> 00:24:09.350
the same biological influences.

00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:12.260
If you say, Ooh,
here's a hormone

00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:13.700
that explains this behavior.

00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:17.020
This behavior is caused
by Hormone X. Hormone

00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:19.610
X is coded for by a gene.

00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:22.240
So suddenly you're not just
talking about endocrinology.

00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:23.860
You're talking about genetics.

00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:25.840
And if there's a
gene there, it has

00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:27.690
been the subject to selection.

00:24:27.690 --> 00:24:29.890
So suddenly you're
talking about evolution.

00:24:29.890 --> 00:24:33.280
If you were talking about what
smells, sights, et cetera,

00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:35.670
are the acute triggers
for a behavior,

00:24:35.670 --> 00:24:37.920
by definition
you're also talking

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:39.860
about fetal development
that determined

00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:43.850
how sensitive those systems
were to those sorts of stimuli.

00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:46.660
What we're going to be
having over and over again is

00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:50.140
any one of these buckets
that we spend some time in,

00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:54.320
all we're going to do is think
of that bucket is at that point

00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:57.390
the most convenient
way of describing

00:24:57.390 --> 00:25:00.820
all of the influences
that came beforehand.

00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:03.300
And in that regard,
there's no buckets.

00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:05.900
All they are, are
temporary platforms.

00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:10.880
And each platform is simply the
easiest, most convenient way

00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:14.780
of describing the outcome of
everything that came beforehand

00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:18.260
starting with millennia
back in evolution.

00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:18.980
OK.

00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:20.290
So that sounds great.

00:25:20.290 --> 00:25:21.610
That's what we're going to do.

00:25:21.610 --> 00:25:22.600
We're going to do this.

00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:25.339
And we're going to be very
sophisticated and fancy

00:25:25.339 --> 00:25:26.380
in our thinking about it.

00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:29.800
And we're not going to fall
for categorical thinking.

00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:32.750
OK, this is a complicated
subject, and we're smart.

00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:34.920
So we're going to try to
think about it smartly.

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:35.790
That's great.

00:25:35.790 --> 00:25:39.200
But like maybe this is just an
irritating song and dance here

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:42.460
of, Ooh, we're not going to
fall for categorical thinking

00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:43.980
like people out there.

00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:45.630
Obviously when
people are thinking

00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:48.600
about stuff like behavior, and
they do this professionally,

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:53.850
professional biologists, yes,
and they understand also.

00:25:53.850 --> 00:25:55.255
This is just the strawman.

00:25:55.255 --> 00:25:57.630
Ooh, we're going to be more
sophisticated in our thinking

00:25:57.630 --> 00:26:01.340
than endocrinologists, and
geneticists, and all of those.

00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:04.170
They obviously know that
these things interact,

00:26:04.170 --> 00:26:06.280
and there's not just
one explanation.

00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:08.140
And it's just the
area they focus on.

00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:09.850
They understand that.

00:26:09.850 --> 00:26:12.760
Let me read you a
few quotes to show

00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:17.200
just how much some of these
folks don't understand that.

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:19.410
First quote.

00:26:19.410 --> 00:26:22.590
"Give me a child at birth
from any background,

00:26:22.590 --> 00:26:25.210
and let me control the total
environment in which he

00:26:25.210 --> 00:26:27.930
is raised, and I will
turn him into anything

00:26:27.930 --> 00:26:30.700
I wish him to be--
whether doctor, lawyer,

00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:32.850
or beggar, or thief."

00:26:32.850 --> 00:26:36.960
This was John Watson, 1912,
one of the founding fathers

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:40.070
of the school of psychology
called behaviorism.

00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:42.410
Behaviorism-- that sort
of reached its apogee

00:26:42.410 --> 00:26:45.200
with this guy BF
Skinner in the 1950s.

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:47.570
This notion that if
you could control

00:26:47.570 --> 00:26:49.860
the rewards, the
punishments, the positive,

00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:52.940
the negative reinforcements,
you could turn anybody

00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:55.870
into anything you want,
whether doctor, lawyer, beggar,

00:26:55.870 --> 00:26:56.900
or thief.

00:26:56.900 --> 00:26:59.380
And we know that isn't the case.

00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:01.470
We know that's not possible.

00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:02.380
We know that.

00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:05.020
All you have to do is
throw in one other factor

00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:08.930
and like a lot of protein
malnutrition during fetal life,

00:27:08.930 --> 00:27:11.020
and you're not going
to be able to do that.

00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:14.990
That being a crude example of
just how wrong this guy was.

00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:18.960
You cannot have all the control
over the environment and turn

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:20.520
somebody into whatever you want.

00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:24.130
Here's a guy living
pathologically in this bucket

00:27:24.130 --> 00:27:27.970
that behavior could be explained
solely by understanding reward

00:27:27.970 --> 00:27:29.500
and punishment.

00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:31.560
Interesting factoid--
this John Watson guy.

00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:33.310
Shortly after that,
he was driven out

00:27:33.310 --> 00:27:37.080
of academia for a wild scandal
that he was involved in.

00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:39.150
And he spent the
rest of his career

00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:42.050
apparently as an extremely
successful advertising

00:27:42.050 --> 00:27:43.204
executive.

00:27:43.204 --> 00:27:44.870
Going to show you
something-- he may not

00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:46.460
have been able to turn
people into anything

00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:47.876
he wanted, but
apparently he could

00:27:47.876 --> 00:27:50.350
make them buy all sorts
of geegaw nonsense.

00:27:50.350 --> 00:27:52.790
OK, next quote.

00:27:52.790 --> 00:27:56.570
"Normal psychic life depends
upon the good functioning

00:27:56.570 --> 00:27:58.270
of brain synapses."

00:27:58.270 --> 00:28:01.260
If you don't know what synapses
are, don't panic at this point.

00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:04.000
They're ways brain cells
connect with each other.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.750
OK. "Normal psychic life
depends on the good functioning

00:28:06.750 --> 00:28:09.700
of brain synapses,
and mental disorders

00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:12.940
appear as a result of the
synaptic derangements.

00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:17.460
Synaptic adjustments will then
modify the corresponding ideas

00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:19.390
and force them into
different channels.

00:28:19.390 --> 00:28:22.960
Using this approach, we
obtained cures and improvements

00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:25.490
but no failures."

00:28:25.490 --> 00:28:27.960
Synaptic adjustments.

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:31.190
What do you suppose those little
old synaptic adjustments are

00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:32.520
that this guy is referring to?

00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:33.040
Any guesses?

00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:33.540
[INAUDIBLE]

00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:37.805
Somebody shout it out.

00:28:37.805 --> 00:28:38.660
[INAUDIBLE]

00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:40.510
Electroshock therapy.

00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:43.990
Electroshock therapy-- you
know, a little synaptic.

00:28:43.990 --> 00:28:47.440
You wish it were as gentle
as electroshock therapy.

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:50.610
This is even more dramatic
synaptic adjustments.

00:28:50.610 --> 00:28:51.360
Any other guesses?

00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:52.564
[INAUDIBLE]

00:28:52.564 --> 00:28:54.970
Yeah, frontal lobotomies.

00:28:54.970 --> 00:28:57.500
You want to adjust
somebody's synapses,

00:28:57.500 --> 00:29:01.100
so you slice off the front
third of their brain or so.

00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:05.390
This was Egas Moniz, a
Portuguese neurologist who

00:29:05.390 --> 00:29:07.120
invented frontal lobotomies.

00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:08.680
It had a different
name at the time.

00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:10.720
But was the person
who started this,

00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:14.820
and something that was done to
tens and hundreds of thousands

00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:18.140
of people who had absolutely
nothing wrong with them.

00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:21.690
One of the darkest chapters
of where psychiatry

00:29:21.690 --> 00:29:23.860
gets in bed with ideology.

00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:27.250
Massive criminal destruction
of people's brains.

00:29:27.250 --> 00:29:31.100
This is what he had to say about
the procedure on his acceptance

00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:33.630
of his Nobel Prize in
Physiology and Medicine

00:29:33.630 --> 00:29:35.260
for having invented it.

00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:37.980
So here we have
somebody pathologically

00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:42.020
living in a world of understand
how synapses are working,

00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:43.130
adjust them.

00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:46.470
And with that, we obtain
cures and improvements

00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:48.720
but no failures.

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:49.820
Final quote.

00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:51.920
Worst one of all.

00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:54.530
"The selection
for social utility

00:29:54.530 --> 00:29:57.490
must be accomplished by
some social institution

00:29:57.490 --> 00:30:00.560
if mankind is not to be
ruined by domestication

00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:02.360
induced degeneracy.

00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:04.660
The racial idea as
the basis of our state

00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:07.330
has already accomplished
much in this respect.

00:30:07.330 --> 00:30:11.040
We may, and we must, rely
on the healthy instincts

00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:13.770
of the best of our people
for the extermination

00:30:13.770 --> 00:30:17.540
of elements of the population
loaded with dregs."

00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:19.220
Anybody want to
guess who that was?

00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:20.430
[INAUDIBLE]

00:30:20.430 --> 00:30:21.510
Hitler?

00:30:21.510 --> 00:30:23.250
Hitler, that
behavioral biologist.

00:30:23.250 --> 00:30:24.950
He was a little bit
busy at the time.

00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:29.590
This was instead one of Hitler's
main scientific propagandists.

00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:33.010
This was somebody living
pathologically in a box--

00:30:33.010 --> 00:30:37.730
a box that doesn't even
exist-- having notion of race,

00:30:37.730 --> 00:30:41.200
and ethnicity, and
genetics, and all of that,

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:43.140
saying let me fix that one.

00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:46.390
Let me exterminate the elements
of the population loaded

00:30:46.390 --> 00:30:49.404
with dregs, and I'll fix up
that little problem of fixing

00:30:49.404 --> 00:30:50.570
something that ain't broken.

00:30:50.570 --> 00:30:51.480
Who was this?

00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:55.220
This was a scientist
named Conrad Lorenz.

00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:58.150
Conrad Lorenz, who probably a
lot of us are familiar with.

00:30:58.150 --> 00:31:01.370
Conrad Lorenz was one of the
founding fathers of ethology.

00:31:01.370 --> 00:31:02.690
We'll learn all about that.

00:31:02.690 --> 00:31:05.620
But he, like everybody
knows him winding up

00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:07.200
in all the little
kid nature books,

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:10.249
Conrad Lorenz discovered
imprinting in birds.

00:31:10.249 --> 00:31:11.290
And he'd be going around.

00:31:11.290 --> 00:31:14.540
He was this little Austrian guy
with this cherubic white beard.

00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:16.890
And he'd always have these
little Austrian shorts

00:31:16.890 --> 00:31:17.780
and suspenders.

00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:20.410
And there would be a whole
bunch of duckies following him

00:31:20.410 --> 00:31:22.770
because they thought he
was mom, and he was totally

00:31:22.770 --> 00:31:24.830
charming and irresistible.

00:31:24.830 --> 00:31:28.230
This sort of old imprinting
with his ducky kids.

00:31:28.230 --> 00:31:32.980
And he also happened to be a
rabid Nazi propagandists who

00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:35.040
went to his grave
saying that there was

00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:37.250
nothing wrong with what he did.

00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:41.160
These are not crappy,
fourth-rate scientists.

00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:45.240
These are not people working
at the University of the Desert

00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:47.580
of Podunk or whatever.

00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:50.690
These are among the most
influential scientists

00:31:50.690 --> 00:31:52.020
of the last century.

00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:55.590
These are people who influenced
how people were educated,

00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:58.710
and when we decided it wasn't
worth the effort of doing it.

00:31:58.710 --> 00:32:02.680
These are people whose influence
led to the brains being

00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:04.710
destroyed of
hundreds of thousands

00:32:04.710 --> 00:32:06.950
of people who had
nothing wrong with them.

00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:09.140
These are the people
who led to the notion

00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:12.360
that you fix up a problem that
doesn't exist by exterminating

00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:13.890
nine million people.

00:32:13.890 --> 00:32:16.510
These are not minor scientists.

00:32:16.510 --> 00:32:18.610
These are the most
influential people

00:32:18.610 --> 00:32:21.520
of the last century coming
out of science in many ways

00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:25.150
living pathologically
inside their own buckets

00:32:25.150 --> 00:32:28.140
and how they could
explain the entire world.

00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:33.140
And thus, again, our goal is
going to not fall for that.

00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:36.000
To think about human
behaviors, and in some cases

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.350
to think about some
of the most disturbed,

00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:40.350
some of the most
frightening, damaged human

00:32:40.350 --> 00:32:43.460
behaviors, and
resist the temptation

00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:47.350
to think inside a bucket
and find the explanation.

00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:51.000
Again, every level we're
going to talk about-- genes,

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:54.470
hormones, neurons, environmental
influence, whatever it is--

00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:57.210
that point will simply
be the easiest way

00:32:57.210 --> 00:33:01.270
of describing all of the
influences that came before.

00:33:01.270 --> 00:33:03.450
They're not even
temporary buckets.

00:33:03.450 --> 00:33:04.840
There's no buckets.

00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:06.690
That will be our goal.

00:33:06.690 --> 00:33:08.830
Now, in thinking about
this and approaching

00:33:08.830 --> 00:33:11.670
human behavior, the biology
of human social behavior,

00:33:11.670 --> 00:33:15.260
often the biology of abnormal
human social behavior,

00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:18.350
we're going to have three
intellectual challenges.

00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:21.190
The first one is
recognizing circumstances

00:33:21.190 --> 00:33:25.030
where there is nothing
fancy about us whatsoever.

00:33:25.030 --> 00:33:28.100
We are just like every
other animal out there.

00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:30.890
And where the challenge
is to accept that.

00:33:30.890 --> 00:33:32.900
Let me give you an example.

00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:34.810
You are a hamster.

00:33:34.810 --> 00:33:36.520
You are a female hamster.

00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:38.560
And you're sitting in your cage.

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:40.290
And, as a female
hamster, what you do

00:33:40.290 --> 00:33:42.479
is you ovulate every
five days or so.

00:33:42.479 --> 00:33:44.020
And you're going
about your business,

00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:45.180
and everything's great.

00:33:45.180 --> 00:33:48.420
Now, somebody puts
another female hamster

00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:49.920
in the cage with you.

00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:54.180
And over the subsequent month or
so, what happens is both of you

00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:56.490
will begin to
lengthen your cycles

00:33:56.490 --> 00:33:59.780
and eventually synchronize
them so that you are both

00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:04.220
ovulating the same afternoon
on a regular basis.

00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:04.900
Amazing.

00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:07.060
This actually works this way.

00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:09.969
And menstrual ovulatory
synchrony-- people

00:34:09.969 --> 00:34:11.860
understand how this
works in hamsters.

00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:14.760
It is done with olfaction,
with pheromones,

00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:18.810
with chemical airborne signals
from one female to another.

00:34:18.810 --> 00:34:21.850
And you can prove this
by electrically recording

00:34:21.850 --> 00:34:23.179
from olfactory systems.

00:34:23.179 --> 00:34:24.699
Or, if you don't
have much funding,

00:34:24.699 --> 00:34:27.946
you could take like a paper clip
over the female hamster's nose,

00:34:27.946 --> 00:34:29.320
and she doesn't
synchronize then.

00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:30.929
It's all done with olfaction.

00:34:30.929 --> 00:34:34.850
And what's most amazing is you
put the two females together,

00:34:34.850 --> 00:34:37.370
and there is a way
of disrupting it.

00:34:37.370 --> 00:34:41.250
Put a male hamster in there,
and suddenly the cycles

00:34:41.250 --> 00:34:43.560
desynchronize and shorten,
and you break it up

00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:45.580
with male pheromones.

00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:48.780
And what's even more remarkable
is you put the two females

00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:53.520
together, and it's not random
who synchronizes the other one.

00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:57.200
The dominant female synchronizes
the subordinate one.

00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:58.570
Totally understood.

00:34:58.570 --> 00:35:00.420
People have been working
on this for years.

00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:06.500
And it works this way in goats,
and sheep, and dogs, and cats,

00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:07.530
and pigs.

00:35:07.530 --> 00:35:11.800
Apparently, you could go to
a 7-Eleven somewhere in Iowa,

00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:16.540
and you could buy a can of pig
ovulatory synchronization spray

00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:18.245
and take it home,
and just run wild.

00:35:18.245 --> 00:35:21.116
I have no idea why you
would want to do that.

00:35:21.116 --> 00:35:23.890
But nonetheless,
that's how you--

00:35:23.890 --> 00:35:27.140
it's up there with the cans
of Cheese Whiz or whatever.

00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:29.540
And it's that well understood.

00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:33.340
And what's remarkable is it
works exactly the same way

00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:38.440
in us humans, where it is
known as the Wellesley Effect.

00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:41.170
The fact that over
the course of freshman

00:35:41.170 --> 00:35:44.790
year, this was first
shown in Wellesley, 1970.

00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:47.400
Over the course of
freshman year, women--

00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:50.720
freshman year roommates-- tended
to lengthen and synchronize

00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:51.960
their cycles.

00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:53.990
And it was done with olfaction.

00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:56.870
Women who had olfactory
deficits didn't synchronize

00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:57.840
with their roommates.

00:35:57.840 --> 00:35:59.670
They would synchronize
unless they

00:35:59.670 --> 00:36:01.910
were having close
intimate relationships

00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:04.880
with a male, in which
case they desynchronized.

00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:08.300
And what's most cruel of
all is, it's not random

00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:10.280
who synchronizes to who.

00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:14.400
The studies tend to show is the
individual who is more socially

00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:17.510
outgoing, extroverted,
dominating, is the one who

00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:18.980
synchronizes the other one.

00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:20.770
And this is well
enough understood

00:36:20.770 --> 00:36:22.370
that when I went
in college, people

00:36:22.370 --> 00:36:24.710
would sit around at the dinner
table and say stuff like,

00:36:24.710 --> 00:36:26.600
Oh, when we roomed
together in the summer,

00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:30.710
I had her synchronized
by August 1st.

00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:32.980
This is what happens if you
hang out with biologists.

00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:35.140
But we're exactly the same.

00:36:35.140 --> 00:36:37.190
The challenge here
is recognizing there

00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:39.180
is nothing fancy about us.

00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:40.900
At various points
in the class, we

00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:45.340
will look at comparisons between
the human and the chimp genome,

00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:47.220
and it's virtually the same.

00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:51.340
Some of the time, we are just a
plain old off-the-rack animal.

00:36:51.340 --> 00:36:55.300
Second challenge is going to be
circumstances where we appear

00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:59.090
to be just like everybody
else, all the other organisms

00:36:59.090 --> 00:37:01.430
out there, but we
do something very

00:37:01.430 --> 00:37:03.520
different with the similarity.

00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:05.640
Let me give you an example here.

00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:08.090
You have two humans,
two individuals,

00:37:08.090 --> 00:37:10.220
who are going through a ritual.

00:37:10.220 --> 00:37:12.200
They are sitting at a table.

00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:13.880
They're absolutely silent.

00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:16.040
They're making no
eye contact, and they

00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:19.090
do nothing more physically
taxing than every now

00:37:19.090 --> 00:37:21.540
and then, one of them
picks up their hand

00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:24.290
and moves a little piece
of wood on the table.

00:37:24.290 --> 00:37:26.470
And if these happen
to be the right two

00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:30.060
individuals in the middle of a
chess grandmaster tournament,

00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:33.070
these people are
maintaining blood pressure

00:37:33.070 --> 00:37:37.710
for six hours running that you
only see in a marathon runner.

00:37:37.710 --> 00:37:41.500
These people are going through
thousands of calories a day

00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:44.150
doing nothing more
than thinking.

00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:46.000
And this is outrageous.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.000
Because you look at
one of these chess

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.880
grandmasters who's just
taken down an opponent

00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:52.450
and took their
queen, or whatever,

00:37:52.450 --> 00:37:55.140
and they will have the
exact same physiology

00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:57.020
as some male baboon
on the Savannah

00:37:57.020 --> 00:38:00.540
who's just ripped the stomach
open of his worst rival.

00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:03.250
And we're doing it
there just with thought.

00:38:03.250 --> 00:38:05.900
And some of the time what's
remarkable about us is we

00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:09.800
have absolutely typical,
boring physiology,

00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:13.700
but we use it in ways that
no other animal could.

00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:17.870
We get stressed by the
inevitability of our mortality.

00:38:17.870 --> 00:38:20.540
We get stressed by reading
something awful that

00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:23.760
has happened to a child on
the other side of the planet.

00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:27.340
We get stressed by
somebody zooming past us

00:38:27.340 --> 00:38:29.940
in some sports car, and
we decide that we are now

00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:31.250
economically inadequate.

00:38:31.250 --> 00:38:33.320
And you never even
see the person's face.

00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:34.270
You just see the car.

00:38:34.270 --> 00:38:37.560
We get stressed reading about
something awful happening

00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:40.530
to a character in a novel.

00:38:40.530 --> 00:38:43.160
This is a whole realm
of things that we

00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:44.700
could do that nobody else does.

00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:48.210
And on the flip side, we can
feel compassion and empathy

00:38:48.210 --> 00:38:49.960
for a loved one.

00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:51.860
But we can also do
the same for someone

00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:54.370
on the other side of the
planet in a refugee camp.

00:38:54.370 --> 00:38:58.020
We can feel compassion for
a member of another species.

00:38:58.020 --> 00:39:01.030
We feel badly when
our pets are injured.

00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:05.140
This is another realm where the
physiology of the response--

00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:08.090
the empathy, the emotional
bonding, all of that--

00:39:08.090 --> 00:39:11.310
it's the same boring physiology
as every other animal

00:39:11.310 --> 00:39:13.820
out there, and we are
using it in a way that

00:39:13.820 --> 00:39:16.220
is unrecognizable.

00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:17.970
Now, some of the
time the challenge

00:39:17.970 --> 00:39:21.420
is the third category, which
is when we are doing something

00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:23.850
that no other
animal out there has

00:39:23.850 --> 00:39:26.170
anything remotely similar to.

00:39:26.170 --> 00:39:29.710
Let me give you an example
here, a shocking example.

00:39:29.710 --> 00:39:31.080
You have a couple.

00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:32.240
They live together.

00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:34.530
They come back at the
end of the day from work.

00:39:34.530 --> 00:39:35.230
They talk.

00:39:35.230 --> 00:39:36.100
They eat dinner.

00:39:36.100 --> 00:39:37.340
They talk some more.

00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:38.850
They go to bed,
and they have sex.

00:39:38.850 --> 00:39:39.683
They talk some more.

00:39:39.683 --> 00:39:40.830
They fall asleep.

00:39:40.830 --> 00:39:44.370
The next day, they do
the same exact thing.

00:39:44.370 --> 00:39:45.550
They come home from work.

00:39:45.550 --> 00:39:46.080
They talk.

00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:46.510
They eat.

00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:46.940
They talk.

00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:47.520
They go to bed.

00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:48.103
They have sex.

00:39:48.103 --> 00:39:49.010
They talk some more.

00:39:49.010 --> 00:39:53.210
They do this every single
night for 30 days running.

00:39:53.210 --> 00:39:56.256
Hippos would be
repulsed by this.

00:39:56.256 --> 00:39:59.360
Because hardly anybody out
there in the animal kingdom

00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:02.470
has non-reproductive sex,
let alone day after day.

00:40:02.470 --> 00:40:06.005
And nobody else out there
talks about it afterward.

00:40:06.005 --> 00:40:09.730
And what we've got here
is a whole novel domain

00:40:09.730 --> 00:40:13.760
of human behavior-- language
use, aspects of our sexuality,

00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:16.820
this profoundly damaging
human uniqueness

00:40:16.820 --> 00:40:19.970
of some individuals confusing
aspects of sexuality

00:40:19.970 --> 00:40:21.010
with aggression.

00:40:21.010 --> 00:40:24.260
In some cases, we are going
to be out there on our own

00:40:24.260 --> 00:40:26.301
trying to understand what's up.

00:40:26.301 --> 00:40:26.800
OK.

00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:29.710
So that will be the general
strategy for the course.

00:40:29.710 --> 00:40:31.589
We will resist
categorical thinking

00:40:31.589 --> 00:40:32.630
over, and over, and over.

00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:35.350
Not just because that's cool,
and nuanced, and subtle,

00:40:35.350 --> 00:40:35.990
all of that.

00:40:35.990 --> 00:40:38.450
But fall into
categorical thinking,

00:40:38.450 --> 00:40:42.650
and you can do unspeakable
damage in a realm of science

00:40:42.650 --> 00:40:43.820
that makes the difference.

00:40:43.820 --> 00:40:47.330
We will do so thinking
constantly about ourselves

00:40:47.330 --> 00:40:50.610
as a boring species just like
all the others out there.

00:40:50.610 --> 00:40:53.590
As a species that has the
same boring physiology,

00:40:53.590 --> 00:40:56.500
but uses it in ways
that are unrecognizable.

00:40:56.500 --> 00:40:59.070
As a species that does
some things that are simply

00:40:59.070 --> 00:41:00.890
without precedent out there.

00:41:00.890 --> 00:41:04.270
And constantly struggling
with what does biology

00:41:04.270 --> 00:41:05.640
have to do with it?

00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:08.770
General structure of the
course-- the first half

00:41:08.770 --> 00:41:11.770
of the course is going
to be an overview,

00:41:11.770 --> 00:41:14.820
an introduction to
the various buckets,

00:41:14.820 --> 00:41:16.364
the various categories.

00:41:16.364 --> 00:41:17.780
And what we're
going to go through

00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:22.920
is understanding an introduction
to evolutionary theory,

00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:26.120
an introduction to what
molecular genetics has

00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:30.550
to do with behavior,
behavioral genetics, ethology,

00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:33.740
the brain, endocrinology,
each of these buckets.

00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:35.830
And you know what
happens next, which

00:41:35.830 --> 00:41:37.590
is in the second
half of the course.

00:41:37.590 --> 00:41:41.150
We will look at specific
behaviors, and in each case rip

00:41:41.150 --> 00:41:42.470
apart the buckets.

00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:44.440
And in each case,
do the strategy

00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:46.920
of what does the
behavior look like?

00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:48.850
What happened a second before?

00:41:48.850 --> 00:41:50.040
The world of neurons.

00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:52.640
What happened with the
sensory stimuli that trigger

00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:54.040
those neurons, et cetera?

00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:56.560
All the way back to the
evolutionary selective

00:41:56.560 --> 00:41:57.950
pressures.

00:41:57.950 --> 00:41:59.760
So the first half
of the course is

00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:01.610
going to be the
introduction to the buckets.

00:42:01.610 --> 00:42:03.240
And I will tell you
right off the bat

00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:04.841
it is a total pain in the rear.

00:42:04.841 --> 00:42:06.340
Because what we're
going to be doing

00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:09.626
is like every 2.5 lectures--
just when you were getting

00:42:09.626 --> 00:42:11.000
the vocabulary
down-- we're going

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.380
to jump to a completely
different bucket.

00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:17.080
It is going to be dizzying, and
unpleasant, and all of that.

00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:18.830
And then second
half of the course,

00:42:18.830 --> 00:42:22.380
oh, the rewards finally come
of then putting all the pieces

00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:26.220
together, looking at individual
categories of behavior--

00:42:26.220 --> 00:42:31.790
sexual behavior, aggressive
behavior, parental behavior,

00:42:31.790 --> 00:42:36.000
schizophrenia, depression,
personality disorders, language

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:36.500
use.

00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:40.160
In each of these cases, what's
going on a second before?

00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:42.580
What's going on 10
million years before?

00:42:42.580 --> 00:42:47.010
Where do all these buckets
disappear in the interactions?

00:42:47.010 --> 00:42:49.990
So that's going to be the
strategy for the course.

00:42:49.990 --> 00:42:52.870
Something critical about
how the course was designed

00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:55.120
is it's got no prerequisites.

00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:58.810
Because I really think this is a
subject that everybody on Earth

00:42:58.810 --> 00:43:00.880
should be forced to learn
about it at gunpoint.

00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:03.310
And thus, it's a
good thing, I think,

00:43:03.310 --> 00:43:06.130
to have this not be one of
those upper level bio classes.

00:43:06.130 --> 00:43:07.750
Let me just get a
sense of who's here.

00:43:07.750 --> 00:43:12.378
How many of you are bio
types, bio majors, hum bio?

00:43:12.378 --> 00:43:14.202
Psychology?

00:43:14.202 --> 00:43:16.030
Anthro?

00:43:16.030 --> 00:43:19.390
Are there any English Lit
grad students in here?

00:43:19.390 --> 00:43:20.610
Yeah.

00:43:20.610 --> 00:43:23.040
OK.

00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:23.920
Good for you.

00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:26.570
Thank you for coming here.

00:43:26.570 --> 00:43:28.060
See what you think
in three months.

00:43:28.060 --> 00:43:31.690
But nonetheless, the class
has been designed explicitly

00:43:31.690 --> 00:43:33.950
to have no background
whatsoever.

00:43:33.950 --> 00:43:35.490
How are we going to do that?

00:43:35.490 --> 00:43:38.750
We're going to do the usual song
and dance of weekly sections,

00:43:38.750 --> 00:43:40.810
and reviews, and all
that sort of thing.

00:43:40.810 --> 00:43:43.060
But in addition,
during this first half

00:43:43.060 --> 00:43:46.160
of the course when we're jumping
from category to category,

00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:48.900
we're going to have each
week additional sections--

00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:51.330
a catchup section--
which is for people

00:43:51.330 --> 00:43:53.642
who have no background
in that area,

00:43:53.642 --> 00:43:55.600
getting you through the
basics, and getting you

00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:58.710
up to speed so that you
will be able to then know

00:43:58.710 --> 00:44:00.720
what's up during the lectures.

00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:01.950
So those will be posted.

00:44:01.950 --> 00:44:05.451
The first one of these is--
let me make sure I've got this.

00:44:05.451 --> 00:44:05.950
Yes.

00:44:05.950 --> 00:44:10.414
It will be Thursday at
7:30 in the room next door.

00:44:10.414 --> 00:44:12.080
And this is going to
be the introduction

00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:14.585
to evolutionary
theory and getting

00:44:14.585 --> 00:44:18.280
you ready for what will be the
evolution lectures Wednesday

00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:19.780
and Friday of this week.

00:44:19.780 --> 00:44:21.820
If you don't have a
strong background,

00:44:21.820 --> 00:44:23.500
go to these catchup sections.

00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:26.220
The TAs who will be
giving that are really

00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:29.760
expert in those areas, lots
of background, and this

00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:31.429
will be your chance to catchup.

00:44:31.429 --> 00:44:32.470
Look through the handout.

00:44:32.470 --> 00:44:34.011
I think I have a
bunch of terms there

00:44:34.011 --> 00:44:36.170
or something where if
you are not terribly

00:44:36.170 --> 00:44:39.270
familiar with those terms in
some discipline, that's a sign

00:44:39.270 --> 00:44:42.070
that you should probably go
for some of the catchup stuff.

00:44:42.070 --> 00:44:44.140
If you really are
just doing this,

00:44:44.140 --> 00:44:47.300
sort of being very adventurous
with no background, if you can

00:44:47.300 --> 00:44:49.370
take it pass/fail,
that will take off

00:44:49.370 --> 00:44:51.100
a lot of the pressure as well.

00:44:51.100 --> 00:44:53.860
Because you could then actually
pay attention to stuff here.

00:44:53.860 --> 00:44:55.890
And the whole
point here is to be

00:44:55.890 --> 00:44:58.720
able to do this even if
you don't have a science

00:44:58.720 --> 00:44:59.480
background.

00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:01.440
Because the obvious
argument I would make

00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:04.330
is everybody has to
learn behavioral biology

00:45:04.330 --> 00:45:07.080
because we're being behavioral
biologists every time

00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:08.950
we serve on a jury.

00:45:08.950 --> 00:45:11.290
Every time we vote
whether or not

00:45:11.290 --> 00:45:14.080
money should be spent
on solving some problem,

00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:16.850
whether it's a problem, and
whether it's solvable or not.

00:45:16.850 --> 00:45:19.280
Every time we try to
make sense of a family

00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:21.340
member sunk in depression.

00:45:21.340 --> 00:45:23.840
Are they having a
biochemical disorder,

00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:26.110
or are they just
indulging themselves?

00:45:26.110 --> 00:45:28.170
We're behavioral
biologists all the time.

00:45:28.170 --> 00:45:31.130
So it's probably a good thing
that we be informed ones.

00:45:31.130 --> 00:45:35.440
So the catchup sections
there-- take advantage of them.

00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:36.060
What else?

00:45:36.060 --> 00:45:38.570
We will have weekly
sections, the usual type.

00:45:38.570 --> 00:45:40.280
People are not
assigned to sections.

00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:44.700
There's going to be 18 of them
or so a week at various times.

00:45:44.700 --> 00:45:46.410
Go to whichever works for you.

00:45:46.410 --> 00:45:50.100
There will be a midterm in
the middle, the midterm coming

00:45:50.100 --> 00:45:53.500
as we finish the last of
those categories, last

00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:54.350
of those buckets.

00:45:54.350 --> 00:45:55.800
There will be a final.

00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:58.210
There's no paper or
anything like that.

00:45:58.210 --> 00:45:59.860
So that will be the pattern.

00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:00.800
What else?

00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:02.100
Other stuff here.

00:46:02.100 --> 00:46:05.130
Office hours-- my office
hours are up on the handout.

00:46:05.130 --> 00:46:06.930
Other things-- breaks.

00:46:06.930 --> 00:46:10.860
We will, with any
luck, be able to be

00:46:10.860 --> 00:46:13.270
able to be organized enough
so that during each stretch

00:46:13.270 --> 00:46:15.910
of class, there will be a five
minute break in the middle

00:46:15.910 --> 00:46:17.331
so you can stand
up, and just get

00:46:17.331 --> 00:46:19.080
to the front of the
line for the bathroom,

00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:22.400
and then we will resume promptly
before you get in there.

00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:24.680
So just to let you
clear your heads a bit.

00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:26.700
Assignments, books, reading.

00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:29.190
There are two books that I
have assigned for the course.

00:46:29.190 --> 00:46:31.530
One is by me.

00:46:31.530 --> 00:46:33.780
And you don't even
have to read it.

00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:37.587
Just go buy a bunch of copies
of and bring me the receipt,

00:46:37.587 --> 00:46:39.170
and you've got a
great grade in there.

00:46:39.170 --> 00:46:40.545
OK, so that's what
is going to be

00:46:40.545 --> 00:46:43.510
pertinent to the second
half of the course.

00:46:43.510 --> 00:46:46.000
We're going to give you a
list of the chapters that

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:47.590
make the most sense to read.

00:46:47.590 --> 00:46:50.010
The other book is a
book by an author named

00:46:50.010 --> 00:46:52.520
James Gleick called Chaos.

00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:55.550
Chaos, year, after year,
after year, in this class

00:46:55.550 --> 00:46:57.630
provokes the strongest opinions.

00:46:57.630 --> 00:46:59.620
A quarter of the
people decide it

00:46:59.620 --> 00:47:01.960
is the most irritating,
irrelevant thing that

00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:04.240
could possibly have been
assigned in the class

00:47:04.240 --> 00:47:05.410
and hate it.

00:47:05.410 --> 00:47:06.840
About half the
people never quite

00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:08.290
figure out what's up with it.

00:47:08.290 --> 00:47:12.220
And a quarter of the people,
their life is transformed.

00:47:12.220 --> 00:47:14.450
They no longer have to meditate.

00:47:14.450 --> 00:47:19.090
They no longer have to
have a-- they are at peace.

00:47:19.090 --> 00:47:20.790
At peace, I tell you.

00:47:20.790 --> 00:47:23.240
Because what this
book does is introduce

00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:27.860
this whole radically different
way of thinking about biology,

00:47:27.860 --> 00:47:30.880
taking apart a world
of reductionism.

00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:35.210
For 500 years, we all have
been using a very simple model

00:47:35.210 --> 00:47:36.930
for thinking about
living systems.

00:47:36.930 --> 00:47:39.950
Which is, if you want
to understand something

00:47:39.950 --> 00:47:43.810
that's complicated, you break
it apart into its little pieces.

00:47:43.810 --> 00:47:45.940
And once you understand
the little pieces

00:47:45.940 --> 00:47:48.050
and put it back
together, you will

00:47:48.050 --> 00:47:50.110
understand the complex thing.

00:47:50.110 --> 00:47:53.330
And what Chaos as an
entire field is about--

00:47:53.330 --> 00:47:55.210
and this was pretty
much the first book that

00:47:55.210 --> 00:47:58.450
was meant for the lay public
about it-- what Chaos shows

00:47:58.450 --> 00:48:00.970
is that's how you fix clocks.

00:48:00.970 --> 00:48:02.780
That's not how
you fix behaviors.

00:48:02.780 --> 00:48:04.850
That's not how you
understand behaviors.

00:48:04.850 --> 00:48:07.040
Behavior is not like a clock.

00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:08.790
Behavior is like a cloud.

00:48:08.790 --> 00:48:10.470
And you don't
understand rainfall

00:48:10.470 --> 00:48:13.450
by breaking a cloud down
into its component pieces

00:48:13.450 --> 00:48:15.270
and gluing them back together.

00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:16.740
So read through that book.

00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:19.130
A lot of it is from physical
sciences rather than

00:48:19.130 --> 00:48:21.370
biological, so we'll
just be suggesting

00:48:21.370 --> 00:48:22.870
the chapters you should read.

00:48:22.870 --> 00:48:25.210
I will tell you it
is the first book

00:48:25.210 --> 00:48:29.130
since Baby Beluga where
I've gotten to the last page

00:48:29.130 --> 00:48:32.330
and immediately started reading
it over again from the front.

00:48:32.330 --> 00:48:34.520
Because along with
Baby Beluga, it's

00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:36.450
had the greatest
influence on my life.

00:48:36.450 --> 00:48:40.100
I found this to be the most
influential book in my thinking

00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:42.160
about science since college.

00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:43.220
So that is a sign.

00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:45.210
There will also be
a bunch of lectures

00:48:45.210 --> 00:48:49.080
in the second half of the course
covering these fields of chaos

00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:50.330
and complexity.

00:48:50.330 --> 00:48:52.130
And if you really
think about it,

00:48:52.130 --> 00:48:54.610
it is going to force a
change in everything else

00:48:54.610 --> 00:48:57.170
that you bring to thinking
about this subject.

00:48:57.170 --> 00:49:01.160
In addition, at this moment
there is not a reader.

00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:02.910
Because I'm trying to
avoid having to get

00:49:02.910 --> 00:49:04.750
you guys to have
to buy a reader.

00:49:04.750 --> 00:49:07.300
I'm trying to redo all
the assigned readings

00:49:07.300 --> 00:49:10.880
so that will just be from papers
that are available online,

00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:12.415
that you'll be able to download.

00:49:12.415 --> 00:49:14.290
I'm about halfway through
getting them there.

00:49:14.290 --> 00:49:16.680
With any luck, there will
not have to be a reader.

00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:18.900
But if it does exist,
it's not going to be big.

00:49:18.900 --> 00:49:20.490
It won't be terribly expensive.

00:49:20.490 --> 00:49:24.610
But there will be a bunch of
readings online to download,

00:49:24.610 --> 00:49:25.670
and it will vary.

00:49:25.670 --> 00:49:28.950
In some cases, it will be
reading the whole paper.

00:49:28.950 --> 00:49:31.170
In some cases, I'll
be suggesting you just

00:49:31.170 --> 00:49:32.410
read the abstract.

00:49:32.410 --> 00:49:36.000
In some cases, it will be to
understand what's happening

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:37.440
in the paper in detail.

00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:39.840
In some cases,
this is an example

00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:43.050
of how people in this bucket
think about this problem.

00:49:43.050 --> 00:49:44.500
Just read the abstract.

00:49:44.500 --> 00:49:47.290
So all of that will be
assigned and made clear.

00:49:47.290 --> 00:49:48.370
What other stuff?

00:49:48.370 --> 00:49:51.480
There's going to be a huge
amount of information online.

00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:54.240
The coursework is going to
be set up for the class.

00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:57.010
There will be copies
of the handouts.

00:49:57.010 --> 00:49:58.960
There will be lecture notes.

00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:02.940
Lecture notes that I have that
will be about five to 10 pages

00:50:02.940 --> 00:50:05.350
covering each lecture,
which we'll get to about

00:50:05.350 --> 00:50:06.420
the middle of the course.

00:50:06.420 --> 00:50:09.000
And I suspect I will run
out of steam by then.

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:11.070
So they won't occur
for the second half.

00:50:11.070 --> 00:50:13.710
There will be commonly
asked questions.

00:50:13.710 --> 00:50:16.760
There will be a Q&amp;A. There
will be course logistics.

00:50:16.760 --> 00:50:19.280
Some of the slides will
be put up in there.

00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:20.340
Make use of that.

00:50:20.340 --> 00:50:23.630
There will be announcements
about time changing for office

00:50:23.630 --> 00:50:25.120
hours, and things like that.

00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:26.970
Make sure you make use of that.

00:50:26.970 --> 00:50:28.956
And people who are
not formally enrolled,

00:50:28.956 --> 00:50:30.330
we are figuring
out a way for you

00:50:30.330 --> 00:50:32.260
to get access to it as well.

00:50:32.260 --> 00:50:35.240
We've also made the decision
that after this lecture,

00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:38.450
the handouts will
not be on paper.

00:50:38.450 --> 00:50:42.230
And that is because
roughly for each lecture,

00:50:42.230 --> 00:50:45.400
we will go through about
5000 pieces of paper,

00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:46.890
even double sided.

00:50:46.890 --> 00:50:49.840
All of this stuff will get
posted on Coursework the day

00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:50.550
before.

00:50:50.550 --> 00:50:52.800
And if that's going
to make it impossible

00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:55.460
for you to follow what happens
in class because you are

00:50:55.460 --> 00:50:58.180
the last human on Stanford
who was not living off

00:50:58.180 --> 00:51:00.250
of a computer screen,
come and talk to me.

00:51:00.250 --> 00:51:04.460
And we will slip you an actual
paper copy of the handouts.

00:51:04.460 --> 00:51:06.380
Most of them, with
any luck, we can

00:51:06.380 --> 00:51:08.730
avoid using paper just because
of how many people there

00:51:08.730 --> 00:51:09.600
are in here.

00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:10.330
Let's see.

00:51:10.330 --> 00:51:11.055
Other stuff.

00:51:13.990 --> 00:51:16.040
Sections will start
this Thursday.

00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:18.560
The regular sections-- all
of those will be posted,

00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:20.240
the times for that.

00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:23.340
Office hours won't
start until next week.

00:51:23.340 --> 00:51:26.320
The midterm will
be in an evening

00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:27.997
rather than during a class time.

00:51:27.997 --> 00:51:30.080
And if we are on schedule,
the class time that day

00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:32.270
will be used for review.

00:51:32.270 --> 00:51:33.230
And anything else?

00:51:33.230 --> 00:51:35.740
Oh, a very good suggestion
just now given that

00:51:35.740 --> 00:51:38.130
the class before
here is humongous,

00:51:38.130 --> 00:51:40.340
and thus we have the
impossible problem

00:51:40.340 --> 00:51:42.110
of a lot of people
trying to get out

00:51:42.110 --> 00:51:44.590
of that while a lot of people
are trying to get into that.

00:51:44.590 --> 00:51:47.540
It might work best for everybody
to come in from the top

00:51:47.540 --> 00:51:50.650
so that you flow down
the stairs seamlessly

00:51:50.650 --> 00:51:54.230
and drive out those other people
before us out the door there.

00:51:54.230 --> 00:51:56.280
That might work a
whole lot better.

00:51:56.280 --> 00:51:59.550
Final thing is we have
a team of TAs here.

00:51:59.550 --> 00:52:01.150
And they are great.

00:52:01.150 --> 00:52:02.070
Here they are.

00:52:02.070 --> 00:52:04.370
TAs, stand up and
be embarrassed.

00:52:04.370 --> 00:52:05.412
OK, stand up, guys.

00:52:08.860 --> 00:52:10.010
There they are.

00:52:10.010 --> 00:52:13.217
There is all but one of
them, who is in transit.

00:52:13.217 --> 00:52:13.800
There you are.

00:52:13.800 --> 00:52:15.200
These guys are great.

00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:17.090
They have either taken
the course before.

00:52:17.090 --> 00:52:19.780
In some cases they have
TA'd the course before.

00:52:19.780 --> 00:52:21.560
They are grad
students in various

00:52:21.560 --> 00:52:23.360
of the bucket specialties.

00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:26.720
I would strongly suggest taking
advantage of the sections.

00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:29.200
What will evolve after
the first few weeks

00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:32.730
is there will be the regular
sections going over the course

00:52:32.730 --> 00:52:34.790
material in the usual way.

00:52:34.790 --> 00:52:37.390
There are also being more
advanced sections for people

00:52:37.390 --> 00:52:39.140
who have stronger backgrounds.

00:52:39.140 --> 00:52:40.120
Take advantage.

00:52:40.120 --> 00:52:42.640
OK, you guys can sit down.

00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:45.760
Leaving them standing there
awkwardly for hours afterward.

00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:47.680
Take advantage of the sections.

00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:50.400
Really greatly skilled TAs.

00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:52.990
OK so that's basically
what we got going here.

00:52:52.990 --> 00:52:53.990
Are there any questions?

00:52:53.990 --> 00:52:54.490
[INAUDIBLE]

00:52:58.800 --> 00:52:59.400
Units.

00:52:59.400 --> 00:53:02.120
OK, somebody
emailed about units.

00:53:02.120 --> 00:53:04.280
The class is five
units, and it's

00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:07.810
because we are meeting
for so many hours a week.

00:53:07.810 --> 00:53:10.880
Actually, for a while the
class was a six-unit course.

00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:13.200
And that was because
of Condoleezza Rice.

00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:15.050
Because when she was
the provost here,

00:53:15.050 --> 00:53:17.810
she totally screwed
the biology department

00:53:17.810 --> 00:53:20.010
by upping our
teaching requirements

00:53:20.010 --> 00:53:22.610
under really nasty conditions.

00:53:22.610 --> 00:53:25.830
So what we all decided
was to find ways,

00:53:25.830 --> 00:53:27.860
every single sleazy
trick we could

00:53:27.860 --> 00:53:29.610
do to puff up the
number of units

00:53:29.610 --> 00:53:31.130
we were supposedly teaching.

00:53:31.130 --> 00:53:32.840
So for a while,
the five unit class

00:53:32.840 --> 00:53:34.400
here would get you six units.

00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:37.130
But eventually they caught
us, so we stopped doing that.

00:53:37.130 --> 00:53:41.370
So first she did that, and then
weapons of mass destruction.

00:53:41.370 --> 00:53:41.870
[LAUGHING]

00:53:41.870 --> 00:53:44.990
So it's a five unit
class at the moment.

00:53:44.990 --> 00:53:47.890
Say hi for me if you
run into her on campus.

00:53:47.890 --> 00:53:50.570
So five units.

00:53:50.570 --> 00:53:53.320
The workload, I think, will
be commensurate with that.

00:53:53.320 --> 00:53:55.480
But it's mainly because
of heavy class time.

00:53:55.480 --> 00:53:57.720
One additional
thing-- lectures are

00:53:57.720 --> 00:54:01.010
going to be taped and put
up online with a day or so

00:54:01.010 --> 00:54:01.940
on Coursework.

00:54:01.940 --> 00:54:04.530
The reason for that is given
that this spans two hour

00:54:04.530 --> 00:54:07.915
block, a lot of people have to
miss one of the hour blocks.

00:54:07.915 --> 00:54:11.260
And in the past, it has worked
to be able to get the stuff up

00:54:11.260 --> 00:54:11.990
online.

00:54:11.990 --> 00:54:15.190
So that will be
advantageous for some folks.

00:54:15.190 --> 00:54:15.880
OK.

00:54:15.880 --> 00:54:16.670
Question?

00:54:16.670 --> 00:54:18.200
Yes, there was a
question up there.

00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:19.720
[INAUDIBLE]

00:54:19.720 --> 00:54:21.030
OK, you take it back.

00:54:21.030 --> 00:54:24.770
OK, any other questions?

00:54:24.770 --> 00:54:25.410
Bagel guy.

00:54:25.410 --> 00:54:27.630
Did you get your bagel,
or did somebody eat it?

00:54:27.630 --> 00:54:28.130
[INAUDIBLE]

00:54:28.130 --> 00:54:30.321
OK, good.

00:54:30.321 --> 00:54:30.820
Good.

00:54:30.820 --> 00:54:32.278
The social contract
comes through.

00:54:32.278 --> 00:54:32.778
Yeah?

00:54:32.778 --> 00:54:34.962
[INAUDIBLE]

00:54:34.962 --> 00:54:35.462
What's that?

00:54:35.462 --> 00:54:38.060
[INAUDIBLE]

00:54:38.060 --> 00:54:40.730
Yes.

00:54:40.730 --> 00:54:41.482
I don't remember.

00:54:41.482 --> 00:54:43.090
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:43.090 --> 00:54:43.670
May 3rd.

00:54:43.670 --> 00:54:46.200
May 3rd for the midterm.

00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:48.010
7:30 in the evening.

00:54:48.010 --> 00:54:48.887
It is a Monday.

00:54:51.420 --> 00:54:52.655
June 4th for the final.

00:54:56.210 --> 00:54:57.092
OK, more questions?

00:54:57.092 --> 00:54:57.592
Yeah?

00:54:57.592 --> 00:54:59.750
[INAUDIBLE]

00:54:59.750 --> 00:55:02.800
What's the format of the
midterm and the final?

00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:05.840
In an ideal world,
given the whole emphasis

00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:08.270
here on no buckets,
blah blah, et cetera,

00:55:08.270 --> 00:55:11.680
It would be long essays,
and requirements of sonnets,

00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:14.640
and sensitive haikus
about the hypothalamus.

00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:16.660
But simply because
of numbers in here,

00:55:16.660 --> 00:55:20.390
we are reduced to sort of like
the lowest common denominator,

00:55:20.390 --> 00:55:22.130
a lot of multiple
choice questions,

00:55:22.130 --> 00:55:24.700
just to make things
saner for the TAs.

00:55:24.700 --> 00:55:26.770
Because it is an
unbelievable job

00:55:26.770 --> 00:55:29.630
to try to grade this
many papers that quickly.

00:55:29.630 --> 00:55:31.640
Broadly, intellectually,
what the midterm

00:55:31.640 --> 00:55:34.340
is going to be about
is just touching base,

00:55:34.340 --> 00:55:37.070
making sure you understand
the basics of each

00:55:37.070 --> 00:55:39.280
of those buckets, each
of those disciplines.

00:55:39.280 --> 00:55:42.540
A little bit of forcing you
to think across disciplines.

00:55:42.540 --> 00:55:45.160
What the final is going
to be entirely about

00:55:45.160 --> 00:55:48.040
is forcing you to think
across the disciplines,

00:55:48.040 --> 00:55:49.430
across the buckets there.

00:55:49.430 --> 00:55:52.080
So it's going to be some very
different intellectual foci

00:55:52.080 --> 00:55:52.860
in there.

00:55:52.860 --> 00:55:54.750
Midterm-- have the facts down.

00:55:54.750 --> 00:55:56.820
Hopefully it won't be
quite as mindless as that,

00:55:56.820 --> 00:55:58.880
but that's the main
function of the midterm.

00:55:58.880 --> 00:55:59.773
OK, more questions?

00:55:59.773 --> 00:56:00.273
[INAUDIBLE]

00:56:10.010 --> 00:56:10.510
OK.

00:56:10.510 --> 00:56:13.584
TAs, did you guys decide to
videotape the catchup section?

00:56:13.584 --> 00:56:15.360
[INAUDIBLE]

00:56:15.360 --> 00:56:16.289
Audio, OK.

00:56:16.289 --> 00:56:16.788
[INAUDIBLE]

00:56:19.230 --> 00:56:19.730
OK.

00:56:19.730 --> 00:56:23.050
Other office hours, or it's
going to be taped and put up

00:56:23.050 --> 00:56:24.600
online on Coursework.

00:56:24.600 --> 00:56:27.100
And if there's critical
handouts, visuals,

00:56:27.100 --> 00:56:29.620
those will be posted
there as well.

00:56:29.620 --> 00:56:30.120
Good.

00:56:30.120 --> 00:56:30.753
More questions?

00:56:30.753 --> 00:56:31.252
[INAUDIBLE]

00:56:35.570 --> 00:56:36.760
Yes.

00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:38.140
And it's going to be for each.

00:56:38.140 --> 00:56:40.565
It's going to be in advance
of the next three lectures.

00:56:40.565 --> 00:56:41.065
[INAUDIBLE]

00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:47.795
Final is at 7:30 for two hours.

00:56:47.795 --> 00:56:48.980
[INAUDIBLE]

00:56:48.980 --> 00:56:49.730
The final?

00:56:49.730 --> 00:56:50.900
Oh, the final, the final.

00:56:50.900 --> 00:56:51.220
5:15.

00:56:51.220 --> 00:56:51.720
[INAUDIBLE]

00:56:54.171 --> 00:56:54.670
12:15.

00:56:54.670 --> 00:57:01.197
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:01.197 --> 00:57:02.280
Just to get that up there.

00:57:02.280 --> 00:57:03.085
12:15.

00:57:03.085 --> 00:57:03.710

00:00:00.988 --> 00:00:02.964
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:05.930
Stanford University.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.423
OK, let's get started.

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.790
We pick up with aggression,
competition, et cetera.

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:25.390
And where have we gotten to?

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.130
We are now just about
to leap to, instead

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.100
of early environment,
early hormonal exposure,

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:37.240
parenatal-- hormones both
pre, before and after birth.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.300
Around that time,
what do they have

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.120
to do with adult
behavior in these realms?

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.170
So, again, this is tapping into
that same concept from the sex

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.840
lectures-- organizational
hormonal effects,

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.100
versus activational.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.250
Organizational early in life,
setting up the nervous system

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.330
to respond later on to some
sort of activational hormonal

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:01.890
effect.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.744
So the basic theme that's come
through with animal studies

00:01:04.744 --> 00:01:07.100
here has been built
around, what if you

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.600
have females who are prenatally,
or perinatally, androgenized,

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.270
exposed to high
testosterone levels?

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.130
And what you see is,
basically, the exact same thing

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.210
as from the sex
lectures, which is

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.190
you get a powerful
masculinization--

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:28.870
organizational masculinization
effect so that later on these

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.340
are females who respond
to even their low levels

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.090
of testosterone
in the bloodstream

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.360
with increased
levels of aggression,

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.270
more aggressive play, bunch
of measures like that,

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.820
less maternal behavior when
having offspring-- a pretty

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.370
clear literature in terms
of prenatal masculinization

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:52.110
of aggressive behavior, as
well as sexual behavior.

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.390
So, as usual, what about humans?

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.690
And we go back to
our two diseases

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.550
from the other week one was that
congenital adrenal hyperplasia

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.580
business, that tumor in
the mother that produces

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.140
vast amounts of,
among other things,

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.310
an androgen, a
testosterone derivative,

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.730
which androgenizes the fetus.

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.070
Or the case with that drug
DES, diethylstilbestrol,

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.790
where some women in
the '50s took them

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.470
for preventing
miscarriage, in some cases

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:22.920
had androgenic effect.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.260
Back to the same
issue as with the sex

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.510
lectures, so what's the behavior
of these individuals like?

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.480
And, again, people
were over that one.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.200
People were really
interested in this.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.030
Both of them kind of
burst on the scene,

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.840
congenital adrenal hyperplasia,
and the DES babies,

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.620
around the same time
lots of people started

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.230
studying these kids as they
started growing up with a very

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.840
simple question
here of, are they

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.770
going to be more aggressive
than typical girls?

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.214
And, ultimately, will they
be more aggressive women?

00:02:56.214 --> 00:02:57.880
And somewhere between
the lines, they're

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.770
also asking the
question, are they

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.950
going to be more aggressive than
is normal for a typical girl?

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.500
So what began to come
out of these studies?

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.420
First off, some interesting,
odd, quirky things-- one

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.430
is when you androgenize
a female fetus

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.790
human, later on as
a child she will

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.754
have a higher than average IQ.

00:03:22.754 --> 00:03:25.770
Whoa, that's kind
of interesting.

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:29.080
Stay tuned, it turns out
that's not at all interesting.

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.150
OK, so that was observed.

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.150
Another thing,
more of a tendency

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.190
towards being left-handed,
better spatial skills.

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.370
And both of those
are attributes that

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.150
are more common among
males than females.

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.870
What else?

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.910
That's all that
sort of stuff having

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.330
to do with ancillary issues.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.970
But now, finally, people
were then really focusing

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:53.910
in on the issues of aggression.

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.170
And by the time these
girls were, I don't know,

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:01.280
10, 12 years old or so, the
findings were absolutely clear.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:07.090
These kids were way, way
more aggressive than normal.

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:08.800
How do you know?

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.280
Because they were less
interested in playing

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.820
with dolls than normal
girls, because they expressed

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.510
less interest in
marriage, because they

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.910
expressed more interest in
having a career some day.

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:26.250
So these were, obviously, over
the top, rabid, psychopathic,

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.050
androgenized, females
because they weren't normal.

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.120
They weren't interested
in dolls, or marriage,

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.530
and were interested in a career.

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:37.250
This was in every textbook
starting in the late '60s,

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.400
and was still there in
textbooks by the mid '80s or so,

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.000
endocrinology textbooks.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.280
And somewhere in the
early '70s or so,

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.000
probably some male
endocrinologists kind of

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.730
discovered that,
you know, wanting

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:54.930
a career if you're female
does not count as aggression.

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.810
Actually, they came up with an
even better term-- assertive

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.050
dominance.

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.480
How's that for a term that just
summarizes an entire worldview

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.240
of gender differences?

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.730
OK, so some male endocrinologist
finally figured that out.

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:09.290
Or maybe actually
they're finally

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:11.680
started being some female
endocrinologists who

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.250
pointed out this was gibberish.

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:16.060
The entire literature
went down the tubes,

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.240
had to be started all over.

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.870
Oh, wanting a career is not
being assertively, dominantly

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.290
aggressive if you're female.

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:27.730
So back to stage one on that
whole literature, lots of work

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:28.560
since then.

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.130
What the literature
has generally shown

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:34.910
is the left-handedness is there.

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:36.650
The spatial issue
seem to remain.

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.420
The higher IQ is there.

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:43.290
What's up with that?

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:45.790
All that's known is
as an explanation,

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:49.890
you find an equivalently
higher IQ in the parents.

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:52.460
So it's got nothing to do
with the androgenization.

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:56.550
There's some sort of
selection going on, perhaps

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:00.370
who winds up being in a study
like this-- sort of more

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:01.460
educated families.

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:02.440
Who knows what.

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.190
But that one turned out
to be a red herring.

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:06.570
What about aggression?

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:08.750
Because now there's
been populations

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:12.430
of androgenized girls who
are now well into adulthood.

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:14.160
What about antisocial behavior?

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.080
What about all those
sorts of things?

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:20.280
And, in general, what is shown
is there's not much going on.

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:23.480
The literature has
been pretty ambiguous

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:27.490
in terms of any sort of trends
there of different behaviors,

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:31.230
different attitudes, different
motivations, et cetera,

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:34.490
in these folks as they grow up.

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:39.310
But suppose what you
found was, as adults,

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:42.640
women who had been androgenized
as fetuses were now

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:47.260
17 times more likely to
start brawls in bar rooms,

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.760
to snipe at people
from the tops of water

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:52.310
towers, things of that sort.

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:53.652
What would you conclude?

00:06:53.652 --> 00:06:56.700
Oh, prenatal testosterone
makes you more

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:59.900
aggressive as an adult-- no.

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:02.820
Same confound with these
folks as from the sex

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:07.020
lectures the other week, which
is these girls were not just

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:10.570
born having been exposed to
lots of testosterone in utero,

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:13.020
and doing something or
other to their brain.

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:17.520
They were born with, basically,
a hermaphroditic profile

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:21.390
of genitals that looked
like males, or intersects,

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:23.700
sexually ambiguous genitals.

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:26.320
These were the kids who
went through a dozen rounds

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:30.070
of reconstructive surgery in
their first half dozen years

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:33.810
of life, their first 10 years of
life, in this part of the body

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:36.890
that everyone is interested in,
but doesn't quite talk about.

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:38.070
And what's up with that?

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:39.460
Why aren't I normal?

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:42.580
And these, once
again, were not girls

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:44.960
who grew up with the only
thing being different

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:48.050
about them their prenatal
hormone exposure.

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:52.070
Basically makes the whole
literature uninterpretable.

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:54.850
So what else in terms of
prenatal hormone effects?

00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:56.580
Another literature
that people have

00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:59.420
looked at, which in
principle could be extremely

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:03.460
informative, looking
at dizygotic twins,

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:05.190
non-identical twins.

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:06.580
So you were a girl.

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:08.550
You're a dizygotic twin.

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:11.080
And you could have a
sibling who is either

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:14.000
a sister or a brother.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.270
In other words, you may have
spent your time in utero

00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:20.800
with your sibling who
either did or did not

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:24.070
secrete a certain amount of
testosterone during that time.

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:26.600
Do you see any sort
of masculinization

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:30.100
of aspects of
aggressive behavior

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:34.710
in girls who are dizygotic
twins with a male sibling

00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:36.929
rather than a female one?

00:08:36.929 --> 00:08:40.929
And what you wind up
seeing is these kids show,

00:08:40.929 --> 00:08:44.370
on the average, more
aggressive play in childhood,

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:46.850
more-- here's the
jargony term-- more rough

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:51.420
and tumble play, more interest
in cars, mechanical things

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:55.420
like that, less interest in
stuffed animals, in dolls--

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:57.410
small effect, very small effect.

00:08:57.410 --> 00:09:01.030
Nonetheless, it suggests that
this is another realm where

00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:04.120
a little bit of prenatal
exposure to testosterone

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:07.590
will change the
behavioral profile.

00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:10.980
Except there's a confound
in these studies, which

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:15.100
is if you were a girl and you
have an identical twin who

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:19.890
is a boy, you are in the
Guinness Book of Records.

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:21.470
OK, let's start that one.

00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:25.160
If you are a girl and you
have a non-identical twin--

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:26.302
that's how it works, OK.

00:09:26.302 --> 00:09:28.510
I knew I should have checked
the notes before coming.

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:31.880
So you've got a non-identical
twin who is a boy.

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:35.390
Not only do you spend
your prenatal environment

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:37.870
being awash in some of
his dribbling hormones,

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:39.940
but you grow up with him.

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:44.850
And girls who grow up
with boys as brothers-- as

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:47.045
opposed to plants as brothers.

00:09:47.045 --> 00:09:48.930
Whoa, what is happening here?

00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:53.270
OK, being a girl growing up
with brother brothers increases

00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:56.940
the likelihood of rough and
tumble play, because that's

00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:59.670
what you do with your
brother-- once again,

00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:01.670
uninterpretable literature.

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:05.680
Generally, what you
see is very, very clear

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:10.060
cut androgenization of
aggressive behavior prenatal

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:13.000
testosterone when you're
looking at rodents.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.880
By the time you're looking at
primates, some pretty strong

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:18.540
patterns but nowhere near
as dramatic as in rodent

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:19.750
species looked at.

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:23.440
By the time you look at
humans, maybe just some hints,

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:25.310
but that at the most.

00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:27.520
Of the most interesting
realms, literatures,

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:30.580
where people have been thinking
about prenatal testosterone

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:33.770
exposure is work
of a guy in the UK

00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:36.150
at Oxford named
Simon Baron-Cohen.

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:40.580
And what he is, is basically
the world's expert on autism.

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:44.190
And he has developed what
is called the hyper male

00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:46.790
hypothesis of autism.

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:50.860
For starters, there's a
very, very big gender skew

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:54.950
in autism-- far more frequent
among boys than girls,

00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:56.820
among males than females.

00:10:56.820 --> 00:11:00.760
And what Baron-Cohen has done
a lot of work on over the years

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:03.060
is first looking
at a whole array

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:08.650
of sex differences between
normal human males and females.

00:11:08.650 --> 00:11:12.380
Sex differences, some of
it's the finger ratio stuff.

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:14.420
Some of it is
neural anatomy, some

00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:17.072
of those structural
differences in the brain,

00:11:17.072 --> 00:11:18.030
having to do with that.

00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:23.000
Some of it is functional spatial
skills versus language skills.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.450
Some of it is problem solving.

00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:28.990
And there is a gender
difference that

00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:33.210
tends to come through with that
on the average in that boys,

00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:36.680
males, men, take more
analytical approaches

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:38.460
to social problem solving.

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:42.600
Girls, women, females,
take more empathic ones.

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:44.790
So that's a difference.

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:46.760
OK, so he studied
all sorts of stuff

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:48.920
like that, and obviously
with hormones as well--

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:52.580
all sorts of really subtle
interesting physical

00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:55.310
differences, whole
array of these.

00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:59.030
And what he has shown is
that individuals with autism,

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:01.650
regardless of their
sex, tend to have

00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:04.570
even more exaggerated
versions of

00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:08.240
those male typical
profiles-- the finger length,

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:12.680
the analytical focus at
the cost of social empathy,

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:16.950
social affiliation, the
very strong spatial skills,

00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:18.400
whole bunch of those.

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:20.730
So he's made a fairly
convincing argument,

00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:22.490
I think, that is good.

00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:26.070
Something's going on in terms
of prenatal androgenization,

00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:31.770
perhaps, which produces a more
masculinized profile, which

00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:34.960
taken to its extreme
winds up being autism.

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:36.810
In other words,
normal male behavior

00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:39.220
is just skating on
thin ice before going

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:43.195
into this whole realm of sort
of dysfunctional socialization.

00:12:43.195 --> 00:12:44.730
Lots of stuff with
that, as we'll

00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:48.040
see next week some very
interesting differences

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:52.090
in the wiring of the cortex
of people with autism.

00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:56.340
And males show that same
thing, just not as extreme.

00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:59.910
OK, interesting footnote
thing-- Simon Baron-Cohen

00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:03.560
is apparently the cousin of
Sasha Baron-Cohen of Borat,

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:07.140
which suggests that must be one
interesting family when they

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:08.830
get together for the holidays.

00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:14.399
OK, moving back one
more box, however-- no,

00:13:14.399 --> 00:13:15.440
I'm not going to do that.

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:17.120
OK, moving back one more box.

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:20.320
Now, instead of
perinatal hormone stuff,

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:22.860
early environment,
what about genes?

00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:23.640
What about genes?

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:26.660
What do genes have to do
with aggression, competition,

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:28.540
cooperation, empathy, et cetera?

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:32.220
It used to be not that
long ago if you even raised

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:36.260
the possibility that there were
genetic elements to aggression,

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:39.030
you would be hounded
out of certain realms

00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:40.130
of social science.

00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:44.890
It was viewed as wildly
incorrect, wildly offensive,

00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:47.150
hidden agendas out the wazoo.

00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:51.600
For some reason, this began to
pass in the early '90s or so.

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:54.490
There were studies in
the mid '80s, conferences

00:13:54.490 --> 00:13:57.100
in the mid '80s, where
there were protests.

00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:59.910
They were picketed, because
in this meeting that

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:03.080
was considering the
sociology of aggression,

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:04.910
the this of aggression,
the biology,

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:07.000
the genetics, the
inclusion of it,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.140
was the grounds
for the picketing.

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:11.920
A number of those were canceled
by the National Institutes

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:15.470
of Health under public pressure
of certain interest groups, all

00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:16.120
of that.

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:19.430
It used to be viewed as
outrageously offensive,

00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:24.640
the notion that genes have
anything to do with aggression.

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:27.920
So there's two ways of
showing that that's wrong.

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:30.020
The first is to
sit somebody down

00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:33.190
and make them go through the
last 15 lectures in this class.

00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:35.990
Or the other is to
reflect on the fact

00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:38.170
that you would leave
a three-year-old

00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:41.850
in the care of a basset hound,
but not with a pit bull.

00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:47.000
Oh, there are breed-specific
differences in behavior.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.120
That, if nothing else,
is a demonstration of it,

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:53.910
that dog breeds have been
bred for 20,000 years or so

00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:56.350
to differ in levels
of aggression,

00:14:56.350 --> 00:14:59.000
in levels of
affiliation, all of that.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.440
People who for some bizarre
reason follow bullfighting,

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:06.180
there are lines of bulls,
different ranches of Spain

00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:08.370
in Mexico, where
they have been famous

00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:12.670
for centuries for the particular
fighting style of the bulls

00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:14.450
that they breed.

00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:15.940
Genes have something
to do with it.

00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:18.140
Of course they do,
because hormones

00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:19.400
have something to do with it.

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:22.010
And because receptors,
and because enzymes,

00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:25.590
and everything with that, it
is impossible to have talked

00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:28.140
about any of this stuff on
the far right of the chart

00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:32.350
without invoking genes--
a ludicrous view.

00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:35.310
So what is known about
the relevance of genes

00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:38.080
to aspects of
aggressive behavior?

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:39.900
First off, at this
stage, there's

00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:42.910
been a whole bunch of studies--
many of them winding up

00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:45.810
in some very visible
journals-- where people find

00:15:45.810 --> 00:15:50.797
a gene implicating it in
abnormal levels of aggression,

00:15:50.797 --> 00:15:52.130
one of those sorts of behaviors.

00:15:52.130 --> 00:15:55.480
Typical strategy-- these might
be genetically engineered

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:58.090
animals to remove that gene.

00:15:58.090 --> 00:16:00.640
Or there might be a
spontaneous mutation.

00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:03.020
And all of these
report that these

00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:05.830
are animals with a whole
bunch of these mutations,

00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:07.750
that these are animals
with abnormally

00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:10.200
high levels of aggression.

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:12.080
That's kind of a
clean experiment.

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:15.900
If you go in-- and thanks to
a mutation, or chopping out

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:18.190
one particular
gene, and now you've

00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:21.300
got a lot more aggression
in that individual.

00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:23.490
That kind of suggests
that that gene

00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:25.410
has something to do
with aggression, perhaps

00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:26.870
a whole lot.

00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:29.460
What are all the
problems with that?

00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:31.260
Other ways that
that gene could be

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:34.630
affecting behavior,
which indirectly winds up

00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:36.380
getting to aggression.

00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:39.440
One possibility-- what
if that's a gene that

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:42.570
is relevant to impulsivity?

00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:45.340
And this is an
individual who, if you

00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:47.970
gave the mouse a
different realm of tests,

00:16:47.970 --> 00:16:52.880
would be shouting its love
to the world at an impusively

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:55.050
high rate, just as
it's being aggressive

00:16:55.050 --> 00:16:56.910
at an impulsively high rate.

00:16:56.910 --> 00:17:01.080
Maybe it's a gene having
to do with impulsivity.

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:04.579
Maybe it's a gene having to
do with one of the things

00:17:04.579 --> 00:17:05.800
we heard in the last lecture.

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:08.640
What are the environmental
releasing stimuli

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:09.980
that cause aggression to occur?

00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:11.650
What's one of the
most reliable ones?

00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:13.150
Pain.

00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:16.329
Oh, it turned out a
number of these strains

00:17:16.329 --> 00:17:19.240
of mice that were identified
with a gene knock-out.

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:22.520
That here's a gene which
can cause aggression.

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:24.589
It turned out that
these were genes

00:17:24.589 --> 00:17:27.710
that made animals that were
much more sensitive to pain.

00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:30.380
And they were more
likely in a pain state

00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:34.200
to displace aggression
on to something else.

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:36.120
Or, as was shown
in some of these,

00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:38.150
these were animals who
were more aggressive.

00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:40.120
But they were also
more affiliative.

00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:43.640
And they were more everything.

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:47.020
Their generic level of
arousal was a lot higher.

00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:50.160
So all these caveats, an
awful lot of the genes

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:53.010
that popped up in the first
generation of those sorts

00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:56.230
of studies that looked
solid, that were replicated,

00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:59.810
a lot of them instead had
to do with indirect routes,

00:17:59.810 --> 00:18:02.940
rather than directly
with aggression itself.

00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:05.640
So what about the genes
that have held up?

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:08.640
And in the really
plausible candidate ones,

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:10.723
we've covered some of
these are already--

00:18:10.723 --> 00:18:15.780
the serotonin synthesis genes,
and the serotonin receptor

00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:17.740
genes, and the dopamine
receptor genes.

00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:21.580
All of those have been very
solidly implicated, really

00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:24.770
careful research, the
molecular biologists teaming up

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:26.510
with behaviorists
knew what they were

00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:29.120
doing-- a genetic component.

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:31.940
And what you know by now
that is absolutely about

00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:35.150
is this figure again.

00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:37.170
That's the case with
all of these genes.

00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:40.520
Oh my God, it's not
genes causing aggression.

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:42.730
We know exactly this
one, modulation,

00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:46.060
all that stuff, again
depending on the environment.

00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:49.090
And the environment
in the realm of genes

00:18:49.090 --> 00:18:50.970
relevant to aggression,
the environment

00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:55.890
is overwhelmingly about abuse
and stress early in life.

00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:59.850
So that's about as far as
genes will get you there,

00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:01.530
which is plenty
good, because this

00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:04.790
is exactly how the genes
should be relevant to behavior.

00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:07.880
This is how all genes
are relevant to behavior.

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:11.110
Remember our ultimate punchline
from the behavior of genetics--

00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:12.590
at the end of the
day, it actually

00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:16.410
doesn't make any sense to
ever say what any gene does,

00:19:16.410 --> 00:19:18.320
only what it does
in the following

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:20.680
range of environments.

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:24.000
In terms of that, what
you are beginning to find

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.780
is this still sort of
growing field which

00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:31.390
is beginning to look at
differences in these genotypes,

00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:33.910
these different
versions of these genes,

00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:37.460
in different populations,
in different cultures.

00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:40.330
And that's just beginning
as a literature.

00:19:40.330 --> 00:19:42.200
I'm not impressed
enough with the findings

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:43.720
yet that it's worth
passing them on.

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:47.680
But that is going to be
a very interesting field.

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:51.020
Finally, there's always this
puzzle with any of these of,

00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:54.130
oh, you've got some gene
that's predisposing you

00:19:54.130 --> 00:19:57.340
towards being aggressive if
you were abused in childhood.

00:19:57.340 --> 00:20:01.280
We still know nothing
in terms of that gene.

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:03.650
That gene has got
no predictive power

00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:07.330
as to whether this will thus
be someone who grows up and is

00:20:07.330 --> 00:20:09.030
a sociopathic murderer.

00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:13.240
Or if this is someone who grows
up and is just an unbelievably

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:15.820
nasty Monopoly player.

00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:19.620
That factor, again,
that same deal-- oh,

00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:22.120
major frontal cortical
damage, disinhibition.

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:24.130
You can't regulate
your behavior.

00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:27.590
No science in terms of
the neurobiology as to why

00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:30.260
one turns into a serial
murder, and the other one who

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:33.210
doesn't catch clues that the
family wants to eat dinner.

00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:36.090
Again, it's the same
puzzle over and over.

00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:39.190
And, again, you could begin to
guess what the differences are

00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:40.400
going to be.

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:43.710
Problems in some of these realms
with these aggressive genes,

00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:46.900
and different upbringings,
different stabilities

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:49.570
and families, different
relationships, different role

00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:52.950
models, you can be off
and running with that one.

00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:56.090
One final domain in
genes and aggression--

00:20:56.090 --> 00:20:58.690
and only a handful of
you the other lecture

00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:00.330
knew who that guy
Charles Whitman

00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:02.400
was, who was the
guy who climbed up

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:04.230
the Texas tower, all of that.

00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:07.000
OK, so here's another
chance to score points

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.100
in the mass murderer realm.

00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:11.720
How many people have ever heard
of a guy named Richard Speck?

00:21:14.816 --> 00:21:18.840
Wow, very few-- no hands.

00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:19.950
OK.

00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:22.850
No, that's a bottle
going up, not a hand.

00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:26.170
Richard Speck was once one
of the most notorious people

00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:27.180
in America.

00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:30.500
Richard Speck was a
nightmare sociopath

00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:34.780
who in 1968 committed
a crime that just

00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:37.130
stunned the entire country.

00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:39.410
People wrote songs about it.

00:21:39.410 --> 00:21:42.990
It was just as brutal
as one could imagine.

00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:47.420
He broke into the
apartment of eight nurses

00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:49.810
living in Chicago,
eight student nurses,

00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:51.950
and slaughtered them all.

00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:58.010
And this was shocking on a
level that's hard to describe.

00:21:58.010 --> 00:22:02.820
Richard Speck was the
nightmare sociopathic murderer.

00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:06.980
So he gets sent off to
prison eventually for life.

00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:09.860
And in the process at
some point or other,

00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:12.450
he's getting some physical exam.

00:22:12.450 --> 00:22:14.840
Somebody takes a blood
sample something.

00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:17.290
And a lab technician
notices something

00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:19.920
interesting in his
blood, examining

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:24.350
the chareotypes, the
structures, of his chromosomes.

00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:27.780
And they discovered that
he had an extremely rare

00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:30.160
chromosomal abnormality.

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:35.690
Females, XX, males,
XY-- every now

00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:38.140
and then you get somebody
where something screws up.

00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:41.270
And what you now get is XYY.

00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:43.760
You get an extra Y chromosome.

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:46.670
And, suddenly, this had
to be the explanation

00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:47.780
for what was going on.

00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:50.600
Males are a total pain in
the ass all over the world.

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:52.100
And they've got
those Y chromosomes.

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:52.680
Oh my God.

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:55.850
The guy has two Y chromosomes
in every single cell.

00:22:55.850 --> 00:22:56.730
This explains it.

00:22:56.730 --> 00:22:59.670
And this suddenly
started this hysteria

00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:02.840
about violence and the XYY male.

00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:05.620
Senators were
bellowing in Congress

00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:09.420
about how we needed to screen
our schoolteachers to make

00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:12.440
sure none of the men
had XYY profiles.

00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:16.410
The military was all set to
start testing recruits for XYY.

00:23:16.410 --> 00:23:18.800
Although it's not clear if
that would get you in or would

00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:21.020
that get you out,
how that one worked.

00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:22.610
But they were
suddenly interested.

00:23:22.610 --> 00:23:25.200
Tons of work went
into it, this flurry

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:27.120
of excitement, special funding.

00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:28.900
We need to be on top of this.

00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:31.150
And by the early '70s,
what was clear was

00:23:31.150 --> 00:23:33.460
there was no
relationship whatsoever.

00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:35.080
So that one went down the tubes.

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:37.390
And then one of those
ironic ending departments,

00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:40.990
it was eventually discovered
that a lab technician had

00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:43.680
blown, had done the
chareotyping wrong.

00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:46.340
And he really
wasn't an XYY male,

00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:49.150
despite that lab technician
then having called up

00:23:49.150 --> 00:23:50.080
the newspapers.

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:53.500
He was a normal XY
sociopathic male.

00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:56.870
So that one was up
there for a while,

00:23:56.870 --> 00:24:01.800
more realms of don't overvalue
the genetic evidence.

00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:05.060
So that shifts us now
one step further back.

00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:08.690
And now begin to look
at whole populations--

00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:12.050
whole populations not yet on
the genetic evolutionary level.

00:24:12.050 --> 00:24:14.810
But what do things
like ecology have

00:24:14.810 --> 00:24:16.940
to do with levels of aggression?

00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:19.313
What does culture
have to do with it?

00:24:19.313 --> 00:24:21.500
What does factors like that?

00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:26.240
And there's a really interesting
array of findings out there.

00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:28.870
First off, one
important dichotomy

00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:31.390
when looking at
traditional human cultures

00:24:31.390 --> 00:24:34.280
is how people make their living.

00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:35.900
And the one that's
pertinent here

00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:39.500
is the dichotomy between
pastoralist people

00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:40.910
and everybody else.

00:24:40.910 --> 00:24:44.590
Pastoralist people, nomadic
pastoralists people, these

00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:45.800
are cow people.

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:48.390
These are people who wander
around with their goats,

00:24:48.390 --> 00:24:49.750
or their camels.

00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:52.170
These are the
shepherds, in contrast

00:24:52.170 --> 00:24:56.610
to traditional
agriculturalists, or far rarer

00:24:56.610 --> 00:24:59.870
traditional hunter-gatherers--
so nomadic pastoralists

00:24:59.870 --> 00:25:01.490
versus everyone else.

00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:04.850
And what a boatload of
anthropology has shown

00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:09.770
is nomadic pastoralists have
higher rates of violence

00:25:09.770 --> 00:25:13.080
both within group
and between group.

00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:17.520
Nomadic pastoralists are vastly
more likely than other groups

00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:23.140
to have standing
armies, warrior classes,

00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:25.980
to have leadership be
derived from people

00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:29.570
who have had the most
success as a warrior,

00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:33.680
to have myths built around their
religion that success in war,

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:37.490
violent acclaim in war,
is your gateway to heaven,

00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:40.610
or whatever afterlife is
viewed as most desirable.

00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:42.430
This is a consistent finding.

00:25:42.430 --> 00:25:46.060
Lots and lots of these
cultures, nomadic pastoralists

00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:50.360
are the ones who came up with
warfare on a certain level,

00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:51.820
and warrior classes.

00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:54.110
And this makes perfect
sense, because one feature

00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:57.130
of being a nomadic
pastoralist is you're nomadic.

00:25:57.130 --> 00:25:59.730
At certain times of
the year, there's

00:25:59.730 --> 00:26:03.370
one subset of the whole
village who's off 15 miles

00:26:03.370 --> 00:26:05.350
away where there's
some good grazing.

00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:07.130
Another group is
on the other side.

00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:10.050
And what this sets you up for
is something that farmers never

00:26:10.050 --> 00:26:11.300
have to worry about.

00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:14.900
Somebody can't come and rustle
your farm away at night.

00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:17.800
But people can come and
steal all your animals.

00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:20.960
Warrior classes, so
that at any given point,

00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:24.910
if people are dispersed, there
is still a designated age group

00:26:24.910 --> 00:26:29.250
of individuals who are out there
to defend the collective herds

00:26:29.250 --> 00:26:30.530
of the group.

00:26:30.530 --> 00:26:32.030
So you see that.

00:26:32.030 --> 00:26:34.270
In the United States,
where that has had

00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:37.270
an interesting
manifestation is where

00:26:37.270 --> 00:26:40.350
people settled in the
original 13 colonies,

00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:42.510
from which part of
the United Kingdom.

00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:45.930
And some very influential
studies, really interesting

00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:49.750
creative ones, pointing
out that the American South

00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:53.050
was disproportionately
settled by sheep people

00:26:53.050 --> 00:26:56.330
from the northern ends
of the British Isles--

00:26:56.330 --> 00:26:58.920
in other words,
nomadic pastoralists.

00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:02.820
Shifting to another realm of
anthropological designation,

00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:06.510
these are people who
disproportionately have

00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:09.520
come from cultures of honor.

00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:12.940
Cultures of honor,
where people are

00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:17.290
willing to kill over very
symbolic slights rather

00:27:17.290 --> 00:27:20.420
than over material
conflicts, where there

00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:22.570
are vendettas within
the group, there

00:27:22.570 --> 00:27:24.980
are vendettas
between groups, where

00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:27.970
it is honorific
to have to avenge

00:27:27.970 --> 00:27:29.780
a death, which you
do not necessarily

00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:32.620
find in agriculturalists.

00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:35.880
Cultures of honor, and
that goes hand-in-hand

00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:37.430
with nomadic pastoralism.

00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:39.510
And what you get
there, typically,

00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:44.400
are very clear rules
about enforced hospitality

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:49.860
for guests, and very clear
rules of the circumstances

00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:54.430
of aggression, retributive
ones, over symbolic affronts.

00:27:54.430 --> 00:27:58.040
And that's really clear
difference regionally

00:27:58.040 --> 00:27:59.670
in this country.

00:27:59.670 --> 00:28:02.010
Interesting sociologist,
University of Michigan,

00:28:02.010 --> 00:28:04.020
named Richard Nesbett.

00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:05.490
And he grew up in the South.

00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:07.360
And I actually heard
him once give a talk

00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:10.870
where he talks about how
when he was about 18 or so,

00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:12.910
he left the South
for the first time

00:28:12.910 --> 00:28:16.090
and joined this very
strange culture at Harvard

00:28:16.090 --> 00:28:17.850
University as an undergraduate.

00:28:17.850 --> 00:28:22.500
And he was dumbfounded by how
different of a world this was.

00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:25.630
People didn't shoot
relatives at picnics,

00:28:25.630 --> 00:28:29.110
at barbecues, which
sounded totally facetious.

00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:31.530
But when you look
at the higher crime

00:28:31.530 --> 00:28:34.620
rates in the American
South, it is not

00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:36.620
occurring in urban areas.

00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:39.390
Urban crime is
roughly equivalent

00:28:39.390 --> 00:28:40.960
all throughout
the United States.

00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:43.910
It is not due to
higher rates of what

00:28:43.910 --> 00:28:47.970
they call 7-Eleven robberies,
which is just material

00:28:47.970 --> 00:28:49.940
gain, a robbery of that sort.

00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:52.010
It is murders of honor.

00:28:52.010 --> 00:28:55.520
It is people who know each
other at social settings,

00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:59.760
people who have some insult,
have something that has nothing

00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:01.660
to do with material wealth.

00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:04.330
This is where the
disproportionate violence comes

00:29:04.330 --> 00:29:06.640
from in the American South.

00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:08.750
And prompted by
that, Nesbett did

00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:12.810
one of the all-time interesting
studies, this famous, amazing

00:29:12.810 --> 00:29:13.510
study.

00:29:13.510 --> 00:29:15.590
So he's at the
University of Michigan.

00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:18.630
And he recruits
student volunteers

00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:25.630
who believe they're going
in to do a hopscotch test,

00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:26.566
or some such thing.

00:29:26.566 --> 00:29:27.440
And they're going in.

00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:29.970
But he made a point of finding
out where everyone came from.

00:29:29.970 --> 00:29:32.620
And he got a fairly
even distribution

00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:35.000
between the relatively
few students in Michigan

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.380
from the American
South, and then students

00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:39.210
from the more traditional North.

00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:42.300
So we get into the psych
building, each individual who's

00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:44.100
coming for their appointment.

00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:45.351
And they take the elevator.

00:29:45.351 --> 00:29:46.100
And they come out.

00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:47.610
And they walk down the hall.

00:29:47.610 --> 00:29:50.440
And this is where the
experiment happens.

00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:53.190
Nesbett has somebody
working on the project--

00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:59.530
a confederate on the project,
I say making a lame pun, OK.

00:29:59.530 --> 00:30:01.652
So a confederate on
the project, a person

00:30:01.652 --> 00:30:02.610
working on the project.

00:30:02.610 --> 00:30:06.160
And this was a big, beefy guy.

00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:09.600
And the whole idea was
that this big, beefy guy

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:11.790
was going to do
something insulting

00:30:11.790 --> 00:30:15.765
to this individual walking
down the hallway, all male.

00:30:15.765 --> 00:30:16.640
Here's what they did.

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:19.250
They clearly did
a lot of thinking

00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:22.560
in designing this study, in
terms of what single word

00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:24.270
this person was going to say.

00:30:24.270 --> 00:30:26.560
And this is what
he wound up saying.

00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:28.700
The volunteer would be
walking down the hall.

00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:31.720
Here comes this big,
beefy guy moving fast.

00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:34.850
And as he comes by him, bumps
into him with his shoulder,

00:30:34.850 --> 00:30:39.710
walks past, and says, watch it,
asshole, and then disappears.

00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:42.020
Volunteer comes in
to start their study,

00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:45.620
and quickly they look at blood
pressure, and heart rate,

00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:48.430
and stress hormone levels,
and testosterone levels,

00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:52.370
and get a typical participant
in this study from the North.

00:30:52.370 --> 00:30:53.360
And they come in.

00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:55.670
And they're a little bit
irritated, and what a jerk,

00:30:55.670 --> 00:30:56.336
and all of that.

00:30:56.336 --> 00:30:58.240
And it's all over with
two minutes later.

00:30:58.240 --> 00:30:59.820
Get people from
the American South,

00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:03.560
on the average massive stress
response, hypertension,

00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:07.510
elevated testosterone levels,
big regional differences.

00:31:07.510 --> 00:31:09.770
These are some of the
physiological pictures

00:31:09.770 --> 00:31:13.010
of cultures of honor.

00:31:13.010 --> 00:31:13.860
What else?

00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:17.790
What other interesting things
about ecosystems, or ecology,

00:31:17.790 --> 00:31:19.050
or cultural aspects?

00:31:19.050 --> 00:31:23.020
Another dichotomy that is
really consistent-- and this one

00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:26.290
maps pretty readily on that
pastoralist versus everybody

00:31:26.290 --> 00:31:30.470
else-- the sorts of cultures
and the level of violence

00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:32.930
that are generated
in cultures that live

00:31:32.930 --> 00:31:36.840
in deserts versus rain forests.

00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:39.500
And, once again,
deserts are where

00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:43.080
you are far more likely to
find nomadic pastoralists, rain

00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:46.660
forests, hunter-gatherers,
mixture of hunter-gatherers,

00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:49.960
small farm agriculturists--
two totally different worlds

00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:51.100
of occupations.

00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:53.720
And what you see
is far higher rates

00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:56.360
of violence within
group and between groups

00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:57.860
in desert dwellers.

00:31:57.860 --> 00:32:02.230
And that maps very
logically onto pastoralists

00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:03.840
versus everybody else.

00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:06.950
Desert dwellers, open
savanna grasslands,

00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:09.520
that's where you see
the warrior classes.

00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:12.010
That's where you see
raiding of other tribes.

00:32:12.010 --> 00:32:15.120
That's where you get that
pattern, virtually none

00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:17.420
among the hunter-gatherers.

00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:19.020
I might point out
something which

00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:21.910
will become sort of focused
on more in a lecture in about

00:32:21.910 --> 00:32:23.540
a week or so.

00:32:23.540 --> 00:32:28.490
I should point out that desert
dweller nomadic pastoralists

00:32:28.490 --> 00:32:30.450
are also the cultures
on this planet that

00:32:30.450 --> 00:32:33.110
invented monotheism.

00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:35.880
Consistent difference--
desert dwellers

00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:37.550
tend more towards monotheism.

00:32:37.550 --> 00:32:40.660
And it was invented by
desert nomadic pastoralists.

00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:43.640
Rainforest cultures
far disproportionately

00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:45.700
tend to be polytheistic.

00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:47.620
And this is not
remotely surprising.

00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:49.560
If you're living in a
rainforest and there's

00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:52.707
10,000 different types of
edible plants around there,

00:32:52.707 --> 00:32:55.040
it doesn't take a lot of work
to come up with the notion

00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:58.850
that there's lots of different
spirits and gods out there.

00:32:58.850 --> 00:33:03.580
What the desert it is about is
one, singular baked truth there

00:33:03.580 --> 00:33:04.930
of surviving.

00:33:04.930 --> 00:33:07.070
That's where
monotheism was born.

00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:08.980
Monotheism,
historically, is more

00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:12.850
associated with cultures that
invented warfare, and invented

00:33:12.850 --> 00:33:16.750
warrior classes, and raiding,
and things of that sort.

00:33:16.750 --> 00:33:19.030
That's kind of interesting.

00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:23.450
OK, moving on, more cultural
differences-- one of the great,

00:33:23.450 --> 00:33:28.840
great predictors of having a
society with lots of violence

00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:31.250
in it, and lots of
warfare elsewhere,

00:33:31.250 --> 00:33:35.370
is a culture that has
rots of cultural myths

00:33:35.370 --> 00:33:37.180
of victimization.

00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:40.690
We have been screwed
historically, because of this,

00:33:40.690 --> 00:33:45.060
this, and this, and coupled
with that an ethos of not

00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:48.520
turning the other cheek,
but instead of retribution.

00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:52.360
Cultures that have
strong histories

00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:55.850
and or myths of victimization,
and strong values

00:33:55.850 --> 00:33:59.930
built around retribution are
extremely violent societies,

00:33:59.930 --> 00:34:03.580
and often really bad
news as neighbors.

00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:05.030
What else?

00:34:05.030 --> 00:34:07.660
Amazing study that got
published about a year ago,

00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:10.460
which is on the
recommended reading list.

00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:11.679
This is not required.

00:34:11.679 --> 00:34:14.710
But this was a deeply
interesting study.

00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:15.210
It

00:34:15.210 --> 00:34:17.110
Was one of those
game theory studies.

00:34:17.110 --> 00:34:18.980
It was a game a little
bit like prisoner's

00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:22.800
dilemma-- not exactly the same,
but the same sort of notions

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:26.350
that you could be very generous
in your game playing style.

00:34:26.350 --> 00:34:28.310
You could be absolutely
rationally fair.

00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:31.639
You could be exploited, a
whole range of possibilities.

00:34:31.639 --> 00:34:33.500
What these guys
did in this study

00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:38.750
was take scads of people
from 40 different countries.

00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:41.210
No they didn't,
from 16, 19, they

00:34:41.210 --> 00:34:44.940
took from a bunch of
different countries.

00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:47.590
And just to control for
things, all of the subjects

00:34:47.590 --> 00:34:49.170
were university students.

00:34:49.170 --> 00:34:52.380
So you're selecting for a
fairly homogeneous bunch,

00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:55.459
both within group and across
these different countries.

00:34:55.459 --> 00:34:59.200
And what they did was they
had people play these games.

00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:03.630
And they had the option for what
is called altruistic punishing,

00:35:03.630 --> 00:35:07.340
which we will hear more about
in a little while, which is you

00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:11.290
have the option to expend
some of your resources--

00:35:11.290 --> 00:35:13.560
your points, your
chips, whatever--

00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:18.269
you can spend to punish the
other individual for cheating.

00:35:18.269 --> 00:35:19.810
And the question,
of course, becomes,

00:35:19.810 --> 00:35:22.576
how much are you willing
to spend to punish somebody

00:35:22.576 --> 00:35:24.200
when they've been
cheating against you,

00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:26.780
when they've been stingy, when
they haven't reciprocated,

00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:28.040
all of that?

00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:30.930
First finding,
which is everybody

00:35:30.930 --> 00:35:32.820
across all the
countries averaged out

00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:35.660
to the same rate, the
percentage of resources

00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:37.340
that someone is
willing to expend

00:35:37.340 --> 00:35:41.410
on punishing a cheater-- so no
particular cultural differences

00:35:41.410 --> 00:35:42.222
there.

00:35:42.222 --> 00:35:46.180
But then they identified
another interesting realm

00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:49.790
of game behavior here,
which they called antisocial

00:35:49.790 --> 00:35:52.650
punishment, which
is where it's not

00:35:52.650 --> 00:35:55.770
that you are expending some
of your resources to punish

00:35:55.770 --> 00:35:57.280
somebody for having cheated.

00:35:57.280 --> 00:35:59.440
It's where you're
expending resources

00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:04.070
to punish someone for
having been overly generous.

00:36:04.070 --> 00:36:07.210
And that pops up in
certain sorts of games.

00:36:07.210 --> 00:36:09.240
It is not terribly
common when it's

00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:12.140
the person who is choosing
with their opponent.

00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:14.520
But when you have
a third party, you

00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:17.210
have no cultural differences
at the rate at which they

00:36:17.210 --> 00:36:18.940
are willing to punish cheaters.

00:36:18.940 --> 00:36:21.270
But here's where
the differences came

00:36:21.270 --> 00:36:24.720
then, the rate at which
people would punish

00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:27.330
unexpectedly generous players.

00:36:27.330 --> 00:36:29.320
And you got a big spread.

00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:31.630
The lowest rate at
which this happened

00:36:31.630 --> 00:36:34.930
was, nicely, as it
turned out, people

00:36:34.930 --> 00:36:37.840
from this country, which is kind
of nice, people from England.

00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:39.790
And, of course, who else?

00:36:39.790 --> 00:36:44.450
The ever-useful Scandinavians
with their powerhouses

00:36:44.450 --> 00:36:47.510
of the cells and their
other cliches all set.

00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:49.820
So the Scandinavians
come through yet again.

00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:51.870
But, for once, we're able
to hang out with them

00:36:51.870 --> 00:36:54.230
and actually count as
having a good profile--

00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:57.390
the lowest rates of
people being willing to do

00:36:57.390 --> 00:37:02.040
this nutso anti-social
punishing in those countries.

00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:05.580
In between rates-- a number
of Middle Eastern countries,

00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:10.060
a large number of Eastern
Bloc countries, in other words

00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:13.712
Slavic ones that used to be
part of the Soviet Union, Korea,

00:37:13.712 --> 00:37:15.220
and turkey.

00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:16.630
Those were the middle ones.

00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:18.580
Which ones had the worst rates?

00:37:18.580 --> 00:37:20.520
I will just read the
two countries here

00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:23.520
that were way up there,
a big gap between them

00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:24.770
and the rest of the countries.

00:37:24.770 --> 00:37:27.210
One was Greece.

00:37:27.210 --> 00:37:32.810
And the other were the Arabic
Emirates on the Saudi Arabian

00:37:32.810 --> 00:37:37.840
Peninsula, where people
are willing to spend more

00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:41.000
to do anti-social
punishing than they

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:43.830
are willing to spend
to punish cheaters,

00:37:43.830 --> 00:37:45.910
extraordinary finding.

00:37:45.910 --> 00:37:49.660
People from Muscat, which
was where the university was,

00:37:49.660 --> 00:37:53.210
those students were more
willing to punish someone

00:37:53.210 --> 00:37:56.570
for being unexpectedly
generous than for somebody

00:37:56.570 --> 00:38:02.200
cheating on a game theory social
contract-- totally amazing.

00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:03.290
So what's that about?

00:38:03.290 --> 00:38:05.080
When they actually
question people,

00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:06.870
you see things with
people from there

00:38:06.870 --> 00:38:09.300
along the lines
of, if people start

00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:11.750
doing that, of being
all generous like that,

00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:13.970
it's just going to up
the ante for everybody.

00:38:13.970 --> 00:38:16.520
Everybody's going to
have to start doing that.

00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:18.370
That's an interesting
piece of reasoning.

00:38:18.370 --> 00:38:21.220
But when you look at a larger
level, what these researchers

00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:23.790
then showed was a
predictor across all

00:38:23.790 --> 00:38:25.620
these different
societies of the rate

00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:30.340
of this anti-social punishment
levels of trust in the society.

00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:33.170
Some standard metrics
used by sociologists

00:38:33.170 --> 00:38:37.110
who were interested in this
concept of social capital--

00:38:37.110 --> 00:38:40.610
how much social trust there
is in the society, how

00:38:40.610 --> 00:38:44.230
much participation there is,
how much of a sense of efficacy.

00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:46.630
And what you see is
the lower the levels

00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:49.290
of social capital
in these societies,

00:38:49.290 --> 00:38:52.990
the higher the rates of this
anti-social punishment, totally

00:38:52.990 --> 00:38:55.040
interesting study.

00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:57.580
Next in the realm
of culture, what

00:38:57.580 --> 00:38:59.980
are people doing
these days, what

00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:02.420
is sort of the science and
the research these days,

00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:05.270
trying to make
sense of terrorism,

00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:07.650
and the sort of cultures
that give rise to them,

00:39:07.650 --> 00:39:10.760
and the sort of ideologies
that give rise to them?

00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:13.400
A number of basic
dichotomies-- one

00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:16.130
is a camp that
views it as always

00:39:16.130 --> 00:39:18.840
abnormal sociopathic behavior.

00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:21.250
Another is a camp that
just views terrorism

00:39:21.250 --> 00:39:24.080
as extremes of ideology.

00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:27.920
The first one is much more
about individual dysfunction--

00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:31.040
oh, this is a neuropsychiatric
problem, perhaps.

00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:33.620
The second one is
one more a feature

00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:36.820
of cultures that have
extremely strong ideologies.

00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:39.720
So that's one division in
there as to how to think

00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:41.320
about it in the community.

00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:44.040
Another division is
really interesting.

00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:46.550
And it's one my reading
of this literature

00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:49.580
that has totally thrown people
in the field for a loop.

00:39:49.580 --> 00:39:52.870
Forever, there has
been a profile,

00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:55.290
a demographic and
psychological profile,

00:39:55.290 --> 00:39:57.550
of individuals who
are terrorists,

00:39:57.550 --> 00:40:00.300
all the way back to the
people who did the Boston Tea

00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:02.920
Party in this country, the IRA.

00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:05.840
All sorts of stuff like
that, the Haganah, which

00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:09.440
was in Israel, terrorist
acts before independence,

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:11.420
studied in a whole
bunch of these

00:40:11.420 --> 00:40:14.570
that there tends to be a
rather consistent profile

00:40:14.570 --> 00:40:17.190
of these individuals
who would be terrorists.

00:40:17.190 --> 00:40:26.030
Young, male, socially isolated,
socially unaffiliated in terms

00:40:26.030 --> 00:40:31.930
of relationships, relatively
uneducated background,

00:40:31.930 --> 00:40:39.710
history of childhood abuse, and
another factor which has just

00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:43.410
completely slipped my mind.

00:40:43.410 --> 00:40:46.230
What was it?

00:40:46.230 --> 00:40:47.200
Oh you all know.

00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:49.620
OK, so that's exactly what
you find in these folks--

00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:53.830
a picture of isolated
sociopathic individuals

00:40:53.830 --> 00:40:57.150
who already have a history
of anti-social behavior.

00:40:57.150 --> 00:40:59.630
These are people who,
if they hadn't stumbled

00:40:59.630 --> 00:41:01.460
into this cause,
would be spending

00:41:01.460 --> 00:41:03.840
their time mugging old ladies.

00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:05.340
That would be that profile.

00:41:05.340 --> 00:41:07.630
And you look at
these various groups.

00:41:07.630 --> 00:41:10.010
And that has been
a consistent one.

00:41:10.010 --> 00:41:13.540
Terrorism in the recent years,
particularly Middle Eastern

00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:17.120
fundamentalist, is a
completely different profile.

00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:19.440
It is not young men.

00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:22.680
It tends to be educated,
well-off people

00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:27.390
in their thirties and forties,
overwhelmingly middle class

00:41:27.390 --> 00:41:29.990
or upper class backgrounds.

00:41:29.990 --> 00:41:32.850
Next, it's not just
middle-aged males.

00:41:32.850 --> 00:41:34.180
It's females.

00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:36.860
It's women to a much
higher extent than seen

00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:39.430
in any previous
sort of population

00:41:39.430 --> 00:41:41.620
dealing with terrorism.

00:41:41.620 --> 00:41:45.030
Next what you see is
these are individuals

00:41:45.030 --> 00:41:47.860
who, on the average,
tend not to have

00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:52.500
had any direct exposure
to the suppression

00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:54.910
that they are fighting against.

00:41:54.910 --> 00:41:58.830
As opposed to the sociopathic
model, a classic picture

00:41:58.830 --> 00:42:03.180
with IRA gunman, the father
was taken away by the whoevers,

00:42:03.180 --> 00:42:05.150
shot, never came back again.

00:42:05.150 --> 00:42:07.420
And they were passed
on the family mantle.

00:42:07.420 --> 00:42:10.300
The current picture is
a very different oe--

00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:15.350
no direct experience
of the persecution.

00:42:15.350 --> 00:42:19.550
Finally, tending not to have
particularly high levels

00:42:19.550 --> 00:42:24.020
of religiosity, and this is
this very contemporary profile

00:42:24.020 --> 00:42:27.720
where you get these 40-year-old
engineers who are suicide

00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:29.850
bombers, where they go home.

00:42:29.850 --> 00:42:31.390
They say goodbye
to their families.

00:42:31.390 --> 00:42:34.730
They make a video tape sort
of wishing everybody well.

00:42:34.730 --> 00:42:37.250
And after having quit their
job and paying the rent one

00:42:37.250 --> 00:42:40.440
extra month, and off they
go and blow themselves up.

00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:43.190
People, I sense, in the
field haven't a clue

00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:46.880
how to make sense of what
this is about, very new,

00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:48.440
challenging feature.

00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:52.160
One interpretation,
one is of a school

00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:54.120
pushed by people
like Phil Zimbardo

00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:57.330
here in the psychology
department, incredibly

00:42:57.330 --> 00:43:01.130
influential psychologist, who as
a general theme over the years

00:43:01.130 --> 00:43:04.600
has argued for the stance that
under the right circumstances,

00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:07.000
under the right
coercive circumstances,

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:10.940
virtually anybody could do
anything that is appalling.

00:43:10.940 --> 00:43:15.180
Zimbardo, who did the famed
Stanford prison study.

00:43:15.180 --> 00:43:18.420
The other view is, OK,
this isn't a lesson

00:43:18.420 --> 00:43:22.927
that anybody could wind up being
this violent if, look at them.

00:43:22.927 --> 00:43:23.760
They're an engineer.

00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:26.260
And they've got a master's
degree, and all of that.

00:43:26.260 --> 00:43:30.270
Instead, it is simply an outcome
of a lot of what terrorism

00:43:30.270 --> 00:43:33.320
is about these days,
a very novel world

00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:36.000
of international terrorism.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.560
Rather than within
country, suddenly you

00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:41.460
have a world of people who
need to be able to do things

00:43:41.460 --> 00:43:45.410
like get passports, and
fly elsewhere, and be

00:43:45.410 --> 00:43:48.760
able to navigate customs,
and things of that sort.

00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:52.150
It is suddenly selecting for a
more sophisticated population

00:43:52.150 --> 00:43:53.540
of individuals.

00:43:53.540 --> 00:43:55.450
You know, the jury's
out on all of this.

00:43:55.450 --> 00:43:58.280
But this seems to be a
very challenging thing

00:43:58.280 --> 00:44:00.310
for that field.

00:44:00.310 --> 00:44:04.340
OK, so now this allows us to
push one step further back.

00:44:04.340 --> 00:44:06.480
I'm going to skip over
a few things there.

00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:09.870
Now, insofar as we are
looking at culture,

00:44:09.870 --> 00:44:13.080
and insofar as we have looked
at anthropological differences,

00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:15.730
and insofar as we have
looked at anything having

00:44:15.730 --> 00:44:19.350
to do with genes, we now
have to talk about evolution,

00:44:19.350 --> 00:44:22.330
because that's where the
genes came from, of course.

00:44:22.330 --> 00:44:24.860
So in first pass,
it's absolutely simple

00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:27.600
to understand what evolution
has to do with aggression, which

00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:31.080
is evolution selects for higher
and higher levels of aggression

00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:33.420
because that's what
you need to succeed.

00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:35.860
Unless you grew up watching
certain types of television

00:44:35.860 --> 00:44:38.150
programs, in which
case evolution selects

00:44:38.150 --> 00:44:40.460
for no aggression
occurring because animals

00:44:40.460 --> 00:44:42.960
behave for the good
of the species.

00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:45.130
So sorting through
that, beginning now

00:44:45.130 --> 00:44:48.230
to apply some of our
foundations from that world,

00:44:48.230 --> 00:44:53.480
individual selection, kin
selection, reciprocal altruism,

00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:56.910
and the modern version
of group selection.

00:44:56.910 --> 00:44:58.610
So where do these play out?

00:44:58.610 --> 00:45:01.030
First, how do these
play out in terms

00:45:01.030 --> 00:45:05.020
of increasing the likelihood
of aggression and antisocial

00:45:05.020 --> 00:45:06.430
behavior?

00:45:06.430 --> 00:45:10.810
Individual selection, males,
that is absolutely simple.

00:45:10.810 --> 00:45:16.270
In every culture on this
planet, and in the vast majority

00:45:16.270 --> 00:45:18.710
of social species that
have been looked at,

00:45:18.710 --> 00:45:21.560
the majority, the major
cause of aggression

00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:25.030
in that society or species
is male male violence

00:45:25.030 --> 00:45:27.820
over reproductive
access to females.

00:45:27.820 --> 00:45:30.340
That is close to a universal.

00:45:30.340 --> 00:45:33.060
That is the most
common form motivator

00:45:33.060 --> 00:45:36.370
of violence on this planet,
humans and otherwise.

00:45:36.370 --> 00:45:38.630
So that one's easy
to come up with,

00:45:38.630 --> 00:45:40.850
in terms of obvious stuff.

00:45:40.850 --> 00:45:44.920
One classic study,
insanely controversial one,

00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:48.680
that appeared to be the
landmark demonstration of some

00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:52.090
of the same in humans--
traditional tribe,

00:45:52.090 --> 00:45:55.480
hunter-gatherer down in
Venezuela in the Amazon

00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:58.080
called the Yanomamo
who have been

00:45:58.080 --> 00:46:01.130
the darlings of high
testosterone male

00:46:01.130 --> 00:46:03.290
anthropologists for decades.

00:46:03.290 --> 00:46:07.430
These have been intensely
studied people, many decades

00:46:07.430 --> 00:46:09.690
now, predominantly by
an anthropologist named

00:46:09.690 --> 00:46:13.060
Napoleon Chagnon, who is now
emeritus at Santa Barbara.

00:46:13.060 --> 00:46:15.550
But he has been a major
figure in anthropology

00:46:15.550 --> 00:46:16.760
for a long time.

00:46:16.760 --> 00:46:21.380
And these people are insanely
aggressive, incredibly high

00:46:21.380 --> 00:46:25.090
rates of violence between
groups, within groups.

00:46:25.090 --> 00:46:28.630
Sufficiently so that
the written monographs

00:46:28.630 --> 00:46:30.663
of the Yanamamo, with
titles like Yanamamo,

00:46:30.663 --> 00:46:33.420
the fierce people,
things of that sort.

00:46:33.420 --> 00:46:36.360
And about 15 years ago,
Chagnon published a paper

00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:39.630
in Science using
decade's worth of data

00:46:39.630 --> 00:46:44.700
showing that the more people,
particular men in this society,

00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:48.760
in this tribe, the more people
you have killed on the average,

00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:51.700
the higher your
reproductive success

00:46:51.700 --> 00:46:52.532
That's it.

00:46:52.532 --> 00:46:53.364
That's it.

00:46:53.364 --> 00:46:54.900
That's everything right there.

00:46:54.900 --> 00:46:56.680
That's Darwin all
over the place.

00:46:56.680 --> 00:46:58.380
Just play it out over time.

00:46:58.380 --> 00:47:02.760
And this is dramatic selection
in a traditional human society,

00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:07.390
the reproductive rewards
of violence and murder.

00:47:07.390 --> 00:47:10.290
Very major, influential
study, picked up

00:47:10.290 --> 00:47:11.520
by all the newspapers.

00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:14.330
And it has been completely
mired in controversy

00:47:14.330 --> 00:47:18.730
ever since, all sorts of
ethical attacks on Chagnon,

00:47:18.730 --> 00:47:20.240
most of which that
have not stuck,

00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:23.910
but some really, really telling
dissections of the work,

00:47:23.910 --> 00:47:26.140
ripping it apart on
statistical grounds.

00:47:26.140 --> 00:47:28.790
I don't think it's
actually for real.

00:47:28.790 --> 00:47:32.740
But that as easily interpreted
within that framework.

00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:35.830
Then more realms of violence,
individual selection,

00:47:35.830 --> 00:47:39.570
orangutans raping each,
rape in other species,

00:47:39.570 --> 00:47:42.180
rape among humans, which
of course brings up

00:47:42.180 --> 00:47:45.650
the question of whether
rape is more about passing

00:47:45.650 --> 00:47:49.850
on copies of your genes, or more
about power and subjugation.

00:47:49.850 --> 00:47:51.800
And the overwhelming
sense in the field

00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:53.760
is it's about the latter.

00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:57.460
It does not have a whole
lot to do with a world

00:47:57.460 --> 00:48:00.330
where you have to start counting
numbers of copies of genes,

00:48:00.330 --> 00:48:04.260
and thinking about
adaptiveness of strategies.

00:48:04.260 --> 00:48:08.280
Next, individual selection,
explaining another realm

00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:11.560
of violence-- in most
cultures, and in an awful lot

00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:15.460
of species looked at, the
second leading cause of violence

00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:22.360
is males attacking females
over denial of sexual access.

00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:27.280
And this is amazingly
common all over the place,

00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:29.490
the second leading
cause of violence

00:48:29.490 --> 00:48:32.620
on this planet across humans
and different cultures,

00:48:32.620 --> 00:48:37.630
and obvious easy individual
selection explanation there.

00:48:37.630 --> 00:48:40.550
Finally, another realm
individual selection,

00:48:40.550 --> 00:48:43.490
the world of female
female competition,

00:48:43.490 --> 00:48:46.360
and infanticide,
competitive infanticide.

00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:47.980
We know how to run all of those.

00:48:47.980 --> 00:48:50.240
So lots of reasons
within the framework

00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:53.230
of individual selection
to see where you are

00:48:53.230 --> 00:48:55.420
increasing rates of aggression.

00:48:55.420 --> 00:48:59.270
Next, kin selection-- you're
going to know that one as well.

00:48:59.270 --> 00:49:02.780
Two brothers or eight cousins,
and that whole strategy,

00:49:02.780 --> 00:49:05.370
and that's why
related individuals

00:49:05.370 --> 00:49:09.280
cooperate with each other in
circumstances of aggression.

00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:13.970
Chimpanzees--
chimps are function

00:49:13.970 --> 00:49:16.430
where females are the ones
who pick up at puberty

00:49:16.430 --> 00:49:17.490
and go elsewhere.

00:49:17.490 --> 00:49:20.070
So all of the adult
males in a chimp group

00:49:20.070 --> 00:49:23.730
are brothers, first cousins,
things of that sort.

00:49:23.730 --> 00:49:26.620
And, thus, you get
one of the outcomes

00:49:26.620 --> 00:49:29.850
of that, high levels of
male male cooperation.

00:49:29.850 --> 00:49:33.630
And as we heard, that has been
reported by Goodall and others

00:49:33.630 --> 00:49:36.250
to result in things
that look absolutely

00:49:36.250 --> 00:49:39.140
like organized
warfare and genocide,

00:49:39.140 --> 00:49:42.460
eradicating all the males in
a group in the next valley

00:49:42.460 --> 00:49:46.190
over, purely along
kinship lines.

00:49:46.190 --> 00:49:47.640
What else?

00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:51.440
Other primates, old world
primates, monkeys like baboons,

00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:55.530
aggression is very much
between lineages than within,

00:49:55.530 --> 00:49:58.600
same exact kin selection
sort of arguments.

00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:00.620
So what happens when
you get to humans?

00:50:00.620 --> 00:50:03.960
Things get more
complicated, of course.

00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:07.675
The first one being that
a relative, relatives,

00:50:07.675 --> 00:50:12.510
is a relative term, in
that it is a sliding scale.

00:50:12.510 --> 00:50:15.440
Wonderful quote to that
effect, a Bedouin quote,

00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:19.700
which is, it's my
brothers, my cousins, and I

00:50:19.700 --> 00:50:21.820
against the world.

00:50:21.820 --> 00:50:26.140
And it's my brothers and
I against my cousins.

00:50:26.140 --> 00:50:29.160
As in, who counts as an
us, and who counts as a

00:50:29.160 --> 00:50:31.280
them is a sliding measure.

00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:33.620
It is a relative measure.

00:50:33.620 --> 00:50:35.540
What you see is by
the time you get

00:50:35.540 --> 00:50:40.210
to humans capacity for very
rapid shifts of us/them

00:50:40.210 --> 00:50:43.040
along the lines of relatedness.

00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:45.680
Now, one of the readings,
which I can't remember now

00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:48.190
if I actually did stick
into an assignment,

00:50:48.190 --> 00:50:52.270
but one of the readings looks
at the classic social biological

00:50:52.270 --> 00:50:55.370
interpretation of making
sense of aggression

00:50:55.370 --> 00:50:57.070
along the lines
of kin selection.

00:50:57.070 --> 00:51:00.360
What do you make of child abuse?

00:51:00.360 --> 00:51:04.020
What do you make of homicidal
parents, damaging parents?

00:51:04.020 --> 00:51:07.620
How do you make sense of that
in a, are you out of your mind?

00:51:07.620 --> 00:51:11.510
This is copies of your genes
there, the challenges to that.

00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:15.280
And this is a couple, Daley and
Wilson, University of Toronto,

00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:17.690
I think, who have for
decades been working

00:51:17.690 --> 00:51:22.440
in this area showing
things like a child is

00:51:22.440 --> 00:51:26.470
more likely to be
abused by a stepfather

00:51:26.470 --> 00:51:28.500
than a biological father.

00:51:28.500 --> 00:51:30.120
Wonder what that's about?

00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:32.380
Kin selection, that's easy.

00:51:32.380 --> 00:51:34.410
A child is more
likely to be abused

00:51:34.410 --> 00:51:38.760
by a paternal grandparent
than a maternal one.

00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:42.500
Kin selection explanation--
more certainty of paternity

00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:45.130
when something is going
through a female line.

00:51:45.130 --> 00:51:46.840
So they've been
all these studies

00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:50.040
showing that degree
of relatedness

00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:52.830
explains a fair amount of
the variability in patterns

00:51:52.830 --> 00:51:56.280
of violence within families.

00:51:56.280 --> 00:51:58.790
Problems with it--
two problems, one

00:51:58.790 --> 00:52:01.710
is there's been a lot of
failure of replications

00:52:01.710 --> 00:52:03.120
in other societies.

00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:06.400
The Scandinavians, for
example, don't see that pattern

00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:07.420
when they study it.

00:52:07.420 --> 00:52:09.850
The other is there's
alternative models.

00:52:09.850 --> 00:52:12.330
There's economic
models, for example.

00:52:12.330 --> 00:52:17.050
When times get tough in
terms of displacement,

00:52:17.050 --> 00:52:18.940
family violence increases.

00:52:18.940 --> 00:52:21.630
Families with stepfathers,
on the average,

00:52:21.630 --> 00:52:23.970
are under more economic
duress than families

00:52:23.970 --> 00:52:27.820
with biological fathers, greater
likelihood of violence there.

00:52:27.820 --> 00:52:30.440
It is a very
uncontrolled literature.

00:52:30.440 --> 00:52:33.022
That is sort of viewed
as in the classic,

00:52:33.022 --> 00:52:36.620
and in other people's view, the
most ideologically most extreme

00:52:36.620 --> 00:52:39.760
way in which social biologists
think about something as

00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:44.560
bizarre and challenging as close
relatives killing each other.

00:52:44.560 --> 00:52:48.760
One final realm, which is in
terms of this us/them stuff,

00:52:48.760 --> 00:52:52.630
the point here being, how do you
decide who is an us and them?

00:52:52.630 --> 00:52:55.860
And suddenly, we're in
our world of ethology.

00:52:55.860 --> 00:53:00.390
Do we make some us/them
dichotomies more easily

00:53:00.390 --> 00:53:01.520
than others?

00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:04.580
Do we have prepared
learning to see

00:53:04.580 --> 00:53:09.460
some differences as more
salient than others in us/thems?

00:53:09.460 --> 00:53:12.740
That remains an immensely
controversial subject

00:53:12.740 --> 00:53:16.530
in terms of what are the natural
categories that young kids

00:53:16.530 --> 00:53:18.320
divide people up by?

00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:21.950
Are kids colorblind in
terms of skin color?

00:53:21.950 --> 00:53:25.020
Are kids blind in
terms of body types,

00:53:25.020 --> 00:53:26.340
in terms of some such things?

00:53:26.340 --> 00:53:29.680
Lots of work in this
area, how unnatural

00:53:29.680 --> 00:53:31.740
are some of the
us/them dichotomies

00:53:31.740 --> 00:53:33.190
that we tend to come up with?

00:53:33.190 --> 00:53:36.630
Stay tuned about 20 minutes, and
you will see not very natural

00:53:36.630 --> 00:53:38.350
at all.

00:53:38.350 --> 00:53:41.320
As soon as you get to humans,
all this social biology

00:53:41.320 --> 00:53:43.840
stuff with kin selection
is interesting, but as

00:53:43.840 --> 00:53:47.180
soon as you get to humans you
get to something vastly more

00:53:47.180 --> 00:53:48.970
interesting and important.

00:53:48.970 --> 00:53:52.380
Back to our recognizing
relatives realm--

00:53:52.380 --> 00:53:56.680
the business of how we interact
not with our relatives,

00:53:56.680 --> 00:54:00.430
but with people who we
feel as close to as if they

00:54:00.430 --> 00:54:03.900
are relatives-- pseudo kinship.

00:54:03.900 --> 00:54:06.890
And what you see in
culture after culture

00:54:06.890 --> 00:54:11.990
is brilliant manipulative skills
on the part of powers that

00:54:11.990 --> 00:54:16.080
be to make some non-relatives
feel more related to each other

00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:17.780
than they actually are.

00:54:17.780 --> 00:54:19.100
What's this about?

00:54:19.100 --> 00:54:21.860
This is military indoctrination.

00:54:21.860 --> 00:54:24.160
The whole point, or
one of the main points,

00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:27.000
of military training
early on is to get

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:30.400
people to become a
band of brothers,

00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:33.060
a band of pseudo
kinshipped relatives,

00:54:33.060 --> 00:54:36.360
to increase the
cooperativity later on,

00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:37.860
to increase the
odds that you are

00:54:37.860 --> 00:54:40.400
willing to give up your life
for the person next to you.

00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:43.060
Culture after culture
is great at doing this.

00:54:43.060 --> 00:54:46.540
Warrior cultures-- for example,
the Maasai in East Africa,

00:54:46.540 --> 00:54:48.840
they have a warrior
stage when you're 15,

00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:51.010
you go become a
warrior, roughly 15.

00:54:51.010 --> 00:54:52.840
And you stay that
way for a decade.

00:54:52.840 --> 00:54:54.170
And you protect the cows.

00:54:54.170 --> 00:54:55.300
And you raid the neighbors.

00:54:55.300 --> 00:54:57.680
And once you're 25,
you become an elder

00:54:57.680 --> 00:55:00.520
and get married then
to a 13-year-old.

00:55:00.520 --> 00:55:05.260
But what you've got there is
the entire structure of warrior

00:55:05.260 --> 00:55:07.880
life is built around
pseudo kinship.

00:55:07.880 --> 00:55:10.860
They live separately
from everybody else.

00:55:10.860 --> 00:55:13.870
They use kinship
terms for each other.

00:55:13.870 --> 00:55:16.440
For the rest of their
lives, their wife

00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:19.100
will refer to somebody
from their warrior class

00:55:19.100 --> 00:55:21.390
as her brother-in-law.

00:55:21.390 --> 00:55:24.450
Warriors are not allowed
to eat their own food.

00:55:24.450 --> 00:55:27.640
They can only share their
food with another warrior,

00:55:27.640 --> 00:55:31.440
all built around
generating pseudo kinship.

00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:34.850
Other version, that other
more industrialized version,

00:55:34.850 --> 00:55:37.310
the Israeli Military,
for example,

00:55:37.310 --> 00:55:40.680
allows kids when they are
signing up after high school

00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:44.740
to join particular units as
a group, a group of friends

00:55:44.740 --> 00:55:47.970
from their high school,
increasing the pseudo kinship

00:55:47.970 --> 00:55:49.790
element there.

00:55:49.790 --> 00:55:54.390
More of that-- something that
was absolutely unprecedented

00:55:54.390 --> 00:55:58.100
when you look at the difference
between kinship and pseudo

00:55:58.100 --> 00:55:58.870
kinship.

00:55:58.870 --> 00:56:03.630
World War II, United States
hugely heterogeneous country,

00:56:03.630 --> 00:56:06.850
obviously, blah, blah,
melting pot, all of that.

00:56:06.850 --> 00:56:10.710
And World War II was sort
of the peak of that picture.

00:56:10.710 --> 00:56:13.770
And what you got in
many, many fighting units

00:56:13.770 --> 00:56:16.100
was something straight
out of central casting

00:56:16.100 --> 00:56:17.820
in these inspirational movies.

00:56:17.820 --> 00:56:23.240
There's McCarthy from Boston,
and Sapiola from Philadelphia,

00:56:23.240 --> 00:56:26.700
and Kewalski from Chicago,
and then the Southern guy,

00:56:26.700 --> 00:56:28.540
and the Jewish guy
from who knows where.

00:56:28.540 --> 00:56:29.940
And they're all together.

00:56:29.940 --> 00:56:33.030
And they're a fighting
unit of American unity,

00:56:33.030 --> 00:56:33.930
and all of that.

00:56:33.930 --> 00:56:35.590
And what does that produce?

00:56:35.590 --> 00:56:39.040
Something that was virtually
unprecedented in warfare.

00:56:39.040 --> 00:56:41.990
If you were an American
soldier in World War II

00:56:41.990 --> 00:56:46.360
and you were of German-American
or German ancestry,

00:56:46.360 --> 00:56:48.740
you would, on the
average, almost certainly

00:56:48.740 --> 00:56:52.160
share more genes in common
with the people you were trying

00:56:52.160 --> 00:56:54.770
to kill than the people
you were willing to give up

00:56:54.770 --> 00:56:58.390
your life for, as you had
classically heterogeneous

00:56:58.390 --> 00:57:02.880
troops on the American side--
completely unprecedented,

00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:06.040
so this business
of pseudo kinship.

00:57:06.040 --> 00:57:08.080
Historically, Vietnam
was apparently

00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:12.570
a major failure of military
pseudo kinship mechanisms,

00:57:12.570 --> 00:57:15.490
in that something
unprecedented was done there,

00:57:15.490 --> 00:57:20.050
which was people were not
kept in stable fighting units.

00:57:20.050 --> 00:57:22.940
Instead, people were constantly
shuttling in and out.

00:57:22.940 --> 00:57:25.640
And you would get these nutty
circumstances, apparently,

00:57:25.640 --> 00:57:27.980
where you'd be there in the
middle of the firefight.

00:57:27.980 --> 00:57:31.220
And the person over here is some
kid who showed up this morning.

00:57:31.220 --> 00:57:33.070
And the guy here,
if he survives this,

00:57:33.070 --> 00:57:35.840
he's shipping out home
to Hawaii tonight.

00:57:35.840 --> 00:57:37.940
And who feels like a brother?

00:57:37.940 --> 00:57:38.890
No one.

00:57:38.890 --> 00:57:43.490
Vietnam had an unmatched degree
of breaking of unity of troops.

00:57:43.490 --> 00:57:44.960
Why was that done in Vietnam?

00:57:44.960 --> 00:57:46.600
Something that kept happening.

00:57:46.600 --> 00:57:49.930
As soon as they allowed
units to remain more stable,

00:57:49.930 --> 00:57:52.520
the rates at which soldiers
were shooting their officers

00:57:52.520 --> 00:57:54.910
would go way up.

00:57:54.910 --> 00:57:58.990
So another, perhaps,
version of cooperation.

00:57:58.990 --> 00:58:01.500
Hand-in-hand with
the pseudo kinship

00:58:01.500 --> 00:58:05.490
is, of course, the flip
side, pseudo speciation,

00:58:05.490 --> 00:58:08.650
the mechanisms, the
psychological, the propagandist

00:58:08.650 --> 00:58:12.950
mechanisms that are available
to make them seem as

00:58:12.950 --> 00:58:15.170
different from you as possible.

00:58:15.170 --> 00:58:17.540
Not just different
sorts of people,

00:58:17.540 --> 00:58:21.800
but pseudo speciation-- they
are so different they hardly

00:58:21.800 --> 00:58:23.890
even count as humans.

00:58:23.890 --> 00:58:26.300
It doesn't count as
much when you kill them.

00:58:26.300 --> 00:58:30.590
And endless realms of that
World War II propaganda

00:58:30.590 --> 00:58:33.450
in the United
States about various

00:58:33.450 --> 00:58:35.160
ethnicities that
we were fighting

00:58:35.160 --> 00:58:39.340
against pseudo speciating,
various genocides, the Rwandan

00:58:39.340 --> 00:58:39.840
one.

00:58:39.840 --> 00:58:44.450
The sort of call to arms there
was kill the cockroaches,

00:58:44.450 --> 00:58:47.700
kill the cockroaches, the
Hutu tribes killing the Tutsis

00:58:47.700 --> 00:58:48.270
there.

00:58:48.270 --> 00:58:50.970
And this was pseudo speciation.

00:58:50.970 --> 00:58:53.910
Let me give you an
amazing example which

00:58:53.910 --> 00:58:58.510
occurred in this country not
all that long ago around 1990.

00:58:58.510 --> 00:59:01.280
An astonishing piece
of pseudo speciation

00:59:01.280 --> 00:59:06.540
that happened in this
country-- 1990, first Gulf War.

00:59:06.540 --> 00:59:11.800
Kuwait was drilling oil from
underneath the Iraq's land.

00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:13.780
Iraq got pissed
off, invaded them.

00:59:13.780 --> 00:59:15.750
And, suddenly, we had
the first Gulf War.

00:59:15.750 --> 00:59:19.910
The United States goes in
there to drive the Iraqis out

00:59:19.910 --> 00:59:20.620
of Kuwait.

00:59:20.620 --> 00:59:22.280
And ultimately has
to make the decision

00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:25.300
of whether to follow them
into Iraq and overthrow

00:59:25.300 --> 00:59:26.350
Saddam Hussein.

00:59:26.350 --> 00:59:27.440
And that wasn't done.

00:59:27.440 --> 00:59:29.360
But so this war going on.

00:59:29.360 --> 00:59:31.950
Very early on, it
was absolutely clear

00:59:31.950 --> 00:59:37.250
where it was heading, which was
that the diplomacy was failing.

00:59:37.250 --> 00:59:38.830
And the United
States was beginning

00:59:38.830 --> 00:59:41.660
to pull together a coalition
of various countries

00:59:41.660 --> 00:59:44.270
that would be a unified
force fighting against Iraq.

00:59:44.270 --> 00:59:47.560
But it had not yet been
authorized by US Congress

00:59:47.560 --> 00:59:49.620
as an act of war.

00:59:49.620 --> 00:59:53.290
Suddenly, into
this came a woman,

00:59:53.290 --> 00:59:56.220
a refugee from Kuwait City.

00:59:56.220 --> 00:59:59.650
Refugee, she was a nurse who
worked in a hospital there.

00:59:59.650 --> 01:00:01.840
She had managed to
get out of Kuwait

01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:03.770
after the Iraqis had invaded.

01:00:03.770 --> 01:00:06.810
And she came and
testified in Congress

01:00:06.810 --> 01:00:10.120
about an appalling thing
that she had witnessed,

01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:13.580
which was when the Iraqis
came in and took over

01:00:13.580 --> 01:00:17.790
their hospital, not only did
they steal all the supplies.

01:00:17.790 --> 01:00:21.470
They took the newborn
infants out of the incubators

01:00:21.470 --> 01:00:24.830
and left them out to die, and
shipped the incubators back

01:00:24.830 --> 01:00:26.650
to Iraq.

01:00:26.650 --> 01:00:29.740
Everyone was
flabbergasted by this.

01:00:29.740 --> 01:00:33.490
This was every newspaper
in the country, everybody

01:00:33.490 --> 01:00:34.760
learned about this.

01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:39.440
Everybody suddenly learned,
my God, they leave babies out

01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:40.320
to die.

01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:43.160
These people hardly
count as human.

01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:46.740
And, critically, that war
was authorized by Congress

01:00:46.740 --> 01:00:49.060
by just a couple of
votes of senators.

01:00:49.060 --> 01:00:50.920
And at least a
half dozen of them

01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:54.320
cited this incident in helping
them decide and this was

01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:56.040
something that had to be done.

01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:59.810
This was a deciding factor
in us going to that war.

01:00:59.810 --> 01:01:04.060
And the remarkable thing
is, it never happened.

01:01:04.060 --> 01:01:07.340
The nurse was not a
nurse from Kuwait City.

01:01:07.340 --> 01:01:11.030
She was the niece of
the Kuwaiti ambassador

01:01:11.030 --> 01:01:12.810
to the United States.

01:01:12.810 --> 01:01:15.550
She had been trained
by a public relations

01:01:15.550 --> 01:01:18.050
firm paid for by
the US government

01:01:18.050 --> 01:01:19.700
to make up this story.

01:01:19.700 --> 01:01:23.070
And she sat in our
Congress on live TV

01:01:23.070 --> 01:01:26.360
in front of the entire
country, lied like crazy.

01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:30.980
And we went into that war
with a 92% approval rate-- one

01:01:30.980 --> 01:01:33.930
gigantic piece of
pseudo speciation.

01:01:33.930 --> 01:01:37.170
My God, they leave
babies out to die.

01:01:37.170 --> 01:01:39.490
It will hardly
count killing them.

01:01:39.490 --> 01:01:41.490
They're hardly even human.

01:01:41.490 --> 01:01:44.360
And the coverage of when it
was revealed what was actually

01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:47.930
going on with this person
didn't come anywhere close

01:01:47.930 --> 01:01:51.510
to front page in any newspaper
in the country, buried down

01:01:51.510 --> 01:01:52.230
in there.

01:01:52.230 --> 01:01:55.430
Virtually the entire country
came out of that incident

01:01:55.430 --> 01:01:58.840
having learned how
inhumane, those people

01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:01.010
hardly count as human.

01:02:01.010 --> 01:02:03.420
OK, five minute break.

01:02:03.420 --> 01:02:05.630
Our principles of
individual selection,

01:02:05.630 --> 01:02:08.280
kin selection,
reciprocal altruism,

01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:11.410
begin to give us insight into
circumstances where evolution

01:02:11.410 --> 01:02:13.710
should select for
more aggression,

01:02:13.710 --> 01:02:16.310
for more warfare
along those lines.

01:02:16.310 --> 01:02:19.470
Now, the flip side--
what is it in the realms

01:02:19.470 --> 01:02:21.750
of these basic building
blocks of evolution

01:02:21.750 --> 01:02:25.590
that will push for more
cooperation, more empathy, more

01:02:25.590 --> 01:02:27.810
affiliation, less violence?

01:02:27.810 --> 01:02:30.500
Individual selection
level-- we already

01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:32.260
know some of these
examples, which

01:02:32.260 --> 01:02:36.190
is that whole world of
alternative male strategies,

01:02:36.190 --> 01:02:39.780
that whole world of sometimes
if you're a male baboon,

01:02:39.780 --> 01:02:42.000
you could pass on lots
of copies of your genes

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.530
by fighting like mad
and being high ranking.

01:02:44.530 --> 01:02:47.550
And sometimes it's by
bypassing all of that

01:02:47.550 --> 01:02:51.180
and being the nice guy, having
an affiliative relationship,

01:02:51.180 --> 01:02:53.830
and female choice
being the thing that

01:02:53.830 --> 01:02:57.320
winds up increasing the number
of copies of your genes.

01:02:57.320 --> 01:03:01.180
So the possibilities of
alternative mating strategies,

01:03:01.180 --> 01:03:05.050
the possibilities of, of
course, parental behavior,

01:03:05.050 --> 01:03:07.310
and all we need to do
there is switch over

01:03:07.310 --> 01:03:10.140
to the world of South
American pair bonding monkeys.

01:03:10.140 --> 01:03:13.380
And those are not animals
with particularly high rates

01:03:13.380 --> 01:03:14.430
of aggression.

01:03:14.430 --> 01:03:16.290
So all of those
are circumstances

01:03:16.290 --> 01:03:19.770
where that could potentially
be perfectly genetically

01:03:19.770 --> 01:03:23.150
viable alternatives
to natural selection

01:03:23.150 --> 01:03:25.010
selects for higher
degrees of violence

01:03:25.010 --> 01:03:28.370
because it passes on more
copies of your genes.

01:03:28.370 --> 01:03:33.780
OK, kin selection-- so we've
just gone through kin selection

01:03:33.780 --> 01:03:37.490
insofar as it can
generate pseudo kinship

01:03:37.490 --> 01:03:40.090
and make you a better,
more murderous soldier

01:03:40.090 --> 01:03:42.070
who is more willing
to give up your life

01:03:42.070 --> 01:03:44.230
for your band of brothers.

01:03:44.230 --> 01:03:46.830
And conversely,
pseudo speciation,

01:03:46.830 --> 01:03:48.950
they hardly even
count as humans.

01:03:48.950 --> 01:03:52.890
The flip side, of course, ways
in which the human capacity

01:03:52.890 --> 01:03:56.860
for pseudo kinship can be
used to decrease violence,

01:03:56.860 --> 01:04:00.240
and to make things more
peaceable, and to make people

01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:02.660
feel more connected
with each other.

01:04:02.660 --> 01:04:05.350
This is a ritual in
all sorts of societies

01:04:05.350 --> 01:04:07.940
where you generate
pseudo kinship

01:04:07.940 --> 01:04:10.180
as a means of generating peace.

01:04:10.180 --> 01:04:14.200
One example, traditional Bedouin
society, here's what happens.

01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:16.770
You have two groups who have
been having tensions, who've

01:04:16.770 --> 01:04:19.440
been fighting, who have been
having some clan warfare,

01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:20.260
whatever.

01:04:20.260 --> 01:04:22.550
And they have now
figured out a way

01:04:22.550 --> 01:04:25.440
to have a treaty to stop
fighting with each other.

01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:28.170
Here is the ritual
that is done, which

01:04:28.170 --> 01:04:31.390
is a bunch of the old guys
from each of the groups come.

01:04:31.390 --> 01:04:32.490
And they sit down.

01:04:32.490 --> 01:04:36.020
And they start exploring
each other's genealogies.

01:04:36.020 --> 01:04:37.572
Who is your great grandparents?

01:04:37.572 --> 01:04:40.030
Who is your great, great, great,
going through all of that.

01:04:40.030 --> 01:04:42.700
And at some point, one
of them has the job

01:04:42.700 --> 01:04:46.460
of making up an imaginary
relationship between the two

01:04:46.460 --> 01:04:47.740
groups.

01:04:47.740 --> 01:04:49.510
Chuck, are you kidding?

01:04:49.510 --> 01:04:52.400
I had a great, great
grandfather named Chuck also.

01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:54.020
We're relatives.

01:04:54.020 --> 01:04:57.480
A ritual absolutely transparent
that people go through

01:04:57.480 --> 01:05:02.520
there to generate a supposed
rationale for relatedness,

01:05:02.520 --> 01:05:05.850
a big ceremony of
pseudo kinship.

01:05:05.850 --> 01:05:09.700
Another one is seen in some
aboriginal groups in Australia.

01:05:09.700 --> 01:05:12.520
Apparently, this is a
motif that pops up often

01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:14.780
in aboriginal rock art.

01:05:14.780 --> 01:05:19.000
And, apparently, it's a symbolic
version of this phenomenon.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.230
OK, you've got
somebody wandering

01:05:21.230 --> 01:05:23.750
through the great
back of beyond there.

01:05:23.750 --> 01:05:27.130
And there are very
few sources of water.

01:05:27.130 --> 01:05:28.960
There's a water hole up ahead.

01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:31.390
You've just walked 10
miles to come to it.

01:05:31.390 --> 01:05:34.080
And you suddenly
notice a stranger

01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:37.920
coming towards the water hole
from the opposite direction.

01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:42.300
And this is a water hole that
is essential for you to survive.

01:05:42.300 --> 01:05:44.570
You are not going to be able
to walk far enough to get

01:05:44.570 --> 01:05:46.000
to the next water hole.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.550
Maybe what you should
do, just in case

01:05:48.550 --> 01:05:50.460
this person winds
up being aggressive,

01:05:50.460 --> 01:05:53.990
is you should attack him
first-- a virtual guarantee

01:05:53.990 --> 01:05:55.060
of aggression.

01:05:55.060 --> 01:05:57.950
Here's a ritual that has
been worked out instead

01:05:57.950 --> 01:05:59.660
that bypasses it.

01:05:59.660 --> 01:06:02.660
The two individuals sit
down around the waterhole.

01:06:02.660 --> 01:06:06.140
And each starts giving
their genealogy.

01:06:06.140 --> 01:06:08.530
I am the son of, who's the
son of, who's the son of.

01:06:08.530 --> 01:06:10.560
Into the next bar
mitzvah, whatever.

01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:12.460
Oh, we're relatives.

01:06:12.460 --> 01:06:14.280
Let's share some water.

01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:15.900
They don't fall for
it for a second.

01:06:15.900 --> 01:06:19.250
But it is a totally artificial
mechanism of pseudo kinship

01:06:19.250 --> 01:06:21.660
to make it possible
for two strangers

01:06:21.660 --> 01:06:25.010
to share this absolutely
essential for life resource,

01:06:25.010 --> 01:06:27.530
and not try to kill each other.

01:06:27.530 --> 01:06:29.860
Same sort of thing,
pseudo kinship

01:06:29.860 --> 01:06:33.830
in all sorts of historical
examples, of revolutions.

01:06:33.830 --> 01:06:36.310
Revolutions generating
pseudo kinship,

01:06:36.310 --> 01:06:39.280
what is often the term
people use for each other

01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:40.920
after the revolution?

01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:45.190
Sisters, brothers unite,
pseudo kinship terms.

01:06:45.190 --> 01:06:50.300
In French, for example, there
is in the informal to tense.

01:06:50.300 --> 01:06:51.695
And there's the more formal one.

01:06:51.695 --> 01:06:54.540
And you're supposed to
use the more formal run

01:06:54.540 --> 01:06:55.810
sort of in the outside world.

01:06:55.810 --> 01:06:58.380
And in the aftermath of
the French Revolution,

01:06:58.380 --> 01:07:02.130
it became illegal to address
somebody, a stranger,

01:07:02.130 --> 01:07:03.630
in the formal tense.

01:07:03.630 --> 01:07:06.070
It always had to be
with the familial

01:07:06.070 --> 01:07:11.010
to tense there, pseudo
kinship, more and more of it.

01:07:11.010 --> 01:07:13.690
So this brings up
what is initially

01:07:13.690 --> 01:07:18.250
a really, really depressing
set of studies, which turn out

01:07:18.250 --> 01:07:22.010
to have a very nice optimistic
resolution to them--

01:07:22.010 --> 01:07:24.230
very disturbing work.

01:07:24.230 --> 01:07:26.850
Work done by a number
of labs over the years

01:07:26.850 --> 01:07:32.340
most notably, Elizabeth
Phelps, who is at NYU.

01:07:32.340 --> 01:07:35.300
And this is work using
functional brain imaging,

01:07:35.300 --> 01:07:36.600
amygdala, all of that.

01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:39.300
You put people in
a brain scanner.

01:07:39.300 --> 01:07:40.690
Actually you put one in.

01:07:40.690 --> 01:07:42.420
And you put them
in one at a time.

01:07:42.420 --> 01:07:46.570
And what you do is you're
flashing up pictures to them,

01:07:46.570 --> 01:07:49.980
flashing up pictures
of people, of faces,

01:07:49.980 --> 01:07:52.200
of faces at a rapid speed.

01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:54.860
So there's virtually no
conscious processing.

01:07:54.860 --> 01:07:57.620
This is all tapping
into subliminal stuff.

01:07:57.620 --> 01:08:00.870
And what she reported, and
what has been replicated

01:08:00.870 --> 01:08:03.780
by a number of other
groups since then,

01:08:03.780 --> 01:08:08.010
is that you get
activation of the amygdala

01:08:08.010 --> 01:08:10.470
on the average in people
when you subliminally

01:08:10.470 --> 01:08:15.720
flash up pictures of
somebody of another race.

01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:20.149
Whoa, shit, that is
distressing to have been found.

01:08:20.149 --> 01:08:22.920
That is not a good
thing, because this

01:08:22.920 --> 01:08:27.290
is totally rapid subliminal
stuff, and replicated,

01:08:27.290 --> 01:08:29.830
some of the best people
in the field showing this.

01:08:29.830 --> 01:08:33.290
My God, the amygdala
has an us/them

01:08:33.290 --> 01:08:35.229
that's, in effect,
there in a quarter

01:08:35.229 --> 01:08:37.060
second after seeing something.

01:08:37.060 --> 01:08:38.510
This is hopeless.

01:08:38.510 --> 01:08:40.660
We are so dichotomized.

01:08:40.660 --> 01:08:43.060
This is a disaster.

01:08:43.060 --> 01:08:46.270
In the years since then,
much more interesting stuff

01:08:46.270 --> 01:08:47.010
has emerged.

01:08:47.010 --> 01:08:48.930
And this has predominately
been research

01:08:48.930 --> 01:08:53.160
by Susan Fiske at Princeton
showing that it doesn't

01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:55.420
necessarily work this way.

01:08:55.420 --> 01:08:58.090
OK, here's what you do.

01:08:58.090 --> 01:09:00.520
First version,
you tell somebody,

01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:02.100
I'm going to be
flashing up pictures

01:09:02.100 --> 01:09:05.319
of faces while you're lying
there in the brain scanner.

01:09:05.319 --> 01:09:07.790
And what you do
is you force them

01:09:07.790 --> 01:09:10.859
to look at the picture in
a way where in a purely

01:09:10.859 --> 01:09:14.020
mechanical visual viewing,
you're going to say,

01:09:14.020 --> 01:09:17.177
some of the pictures
have a big red dot

01:09:17.177 --> 01:09:18.260
right in the middle of it.

01:09:18.260 --> 01:09:19.718
And any time one
of those comes up,

01:09:19.718 --> 01:09:21.490
I want you to press this button.

01:09:21.490 --> 01:09:24.580
In other words, just
process the picture

01:09:24.580 --> 01:09:27.060
for just a visual pattern.

01:09:27.060 --> 01:09:27.990
You do that.

01:09:27.990 --> 01:09:29.750
And the amygdala
doesn't activate

01:09:29.750 --> 01:09:32.160
when you see a picture of
somebody of another race.

01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:34.620
OK, this is not very exciting.

01:09:34.620 --> 01:09:37.390
Now, the next thing
she would do--

01:09:37.390 --> 01:09:41.090
get people to start
thinking categorically.

01:09:41.090 --> 01:09:41.939
Here's what you do.

01:09:41.939 --> 01:09:43.939
She would now have people
going in there saying,

01:09:43.939 --> 01:09:46.605
I'm going to give you a bunch of
pictures, flashing up pictures.

01:09:46.605 --> 01:09:49.653
And what I want you
to do is to stop.

01:09:49.653 --> 01:09:51.069
I'm going to stop
at some of them.

01:09:51.069 --> 01:09:52.520
And I want you to look closely.

01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:56.020
And tell me, do you think
this person is older than age

01:09:56.020 --> 01:09:59.030
30 or younger than age 30?

01:09:59.030 --> 01:10:02.710
In other words, what you have
just requested the person to do

01:10:02.710 --> 01:10:04.570
is think of the
face in the picture

01:10:04.570 --> 01:10:09.542
as belonging to a category,
rather than as an individual.

01:10:09.542 --> 01:10:11.250
You're going to look
at this picture now.

01:10:11.250 --> 01:10:13.450
And you don't really need
to care who the person is,

01:10:13.450 --> 01:10:15.090
or what they look
like, or anything.

01:10:15.090 --> 01:10:18.900
All you need to do is think
of them as part of a category.

01:10:18.900 --> 01:10:20.740
And when you bias
people like that,

01:10:20.740 --> 01:10:23.810
and you flash up the picture
of somebody from another race,

01:10:23.810 --> 01:10:26.330
the amygdala gets
even more activated.

01:10:26.330 --> 01:10:30.450
You have primed somebody to
think not about individuals,

01:10:30.450 --> 01:10:33.930
but to make them think
of people in categories.

01:10:33.930 --> 01:10:37.790
Finally, what she shows
is exactly the opposite.

01:10:37.790 --> 01:10:40.160
Now what she does
is prime something,

01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:42.640
a totally neutral
sort of priming,

01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:46.010
to try to get people to think
of the person in the picture

01:10:46.010 --> 01:10:47.660
as an individual.

01:10:47.660 --> 01:10:51.550
And she asks totally
innocuous, neutral things

01:10:51.550 --> 01:10:53.910
along the lines of, I want
you to look at the picture.

01:10:53.910 --> 01:10:54.952
I know this sounds silly.

01:10:54.952 --> 01:10:56.534
But I want you to
look at the picture.

01:10:56.534 --> 01:10:58.930
And tell me, do you think is
this the kind of person who

01:10:58.930 --> 01:11:02.300
likes Coke or Pepsi?

01:11:02.300 --> 01:11:04.490
Totally sort of
diagonal orthogonal

01:11:04.490 --> 01:11:07.320
to all of this stuff,
get someone doing that.

01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:11.770
And now the amygdala
doesn't activate.

01:11:11.770 --> 01:11:17.110
All you need to do in that study
is subliminally prime someone

01:11:17.110 --> 01:11:19.450
to think of someone who
they're about to look

01:11:19.450 --> 01:11:23.630
at as an individual, rather
than as part of a category,

01:11:23.630 --> 01:11:25.280
than as part of a group.

01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:29.860
This is not rebuilding society
so that we change our us/thems.

01:11:29.860 --> 01:11:33.580
This is a minor prompt 30
seconds before somebody has

01:11:33.580 --> 01:11:35.130
the pictures flashed at them.

01:11:35.130 --> 01:11:38.270
That's all it took
in these studies.

01:11:38.270 --> 01:11:41.780
More good news emerged,
which was that you would also

01:11:41.780 --> 01:11:44.440
see separate of these
sorts of manipulations,

01:11:44.440 --> 01:11:47.970
long-term developmental
aspects that were predictors

01:11:47.970 --> 01:11:49.130
of this phenomenon.

01:11:49.130 --> 01:11:53.060
People who grew up in racially
and ethnically diverse

01:11:53.060 --> 01:11:56.640
neighborhoods didn't have
this amygdala effect.

01:11:56.640 --> 01:11:59.360
People who had had a
significant relationship

01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:02.500
with a significant
other of another race

01:12:02.500 --> 01:12:05.450
did not have this
amygdala reaction there.

01:12:05.450 --> 01:12:09.200
So the easy solution to
this being depressing--

01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:14.200
OK, early childhood, exposure
throughout life, that's great.

01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:15.520
That's very good news.

01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:19.470
But even more remarkable in
her studies is just a prompt.

01:12:19.470 --> 01:12:23.290
Prompt somebody to think of
that person as an individual.

01:12:23.290 --> 01:12:28.300
And your amygdala is not doing
an us/them with them anymore.

01:12:28.300 --> 01:12:31.160
Now, this whole business
about if you grew up

01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:35.070
in a diverse neighborhood,
that taps into a whole field

01:12:35.070 --> 01:12:37.100
called contact theory.

01:12:37.100 --> 01:12:39.460
The notion that
aggression is decreased,

01:12:39.460 --> 01:12:43.090
affiliation is increased,
if people have grown up

01:12:43.090 --> 01:12:46.850
with lots of contact with
people from other cultures,

01:12:46.850 --> 01:12:50.010
other societies other
religions, all of that,

01:12:50.010 --> 01:12:53.430
or if people live
in contact with it.

01:12:53.430 --> 01:12:56.780
And, in general, what this
large literature shows is

01:12:56.780 --> 01:12:58.280
it does work that way.

01:12:58.280 --> 01:13:01.950
Contact theory, growing up
in diverse neighborhoods,

01:13:01.950 --> 01:13:03.940
growing up in
diverse communities,

01:13:03.940 --> 01:13:07.310
increases the likelihood
of a broader umbrella

01:13:07.310 --> 01:13:10.490
of what counts as an us.

01:13:10.490 --> 01:13:11.440
That's good.

01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:13.160
Where does it not work?

01:13:13.160 --> 01:13:16.060
One realm where most of
the studies have shown this

01:13:16.060 --> 01:13:18.710
is a realm that's
totally heartwarming.

01:13:18.710 --> 01:13:20.560
And it would be
great if it did work.

01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:23.010
But most of the studies
show that it doesn't.

01:13:23.010 --> 01:13:25.660
These are the circumstances
where somebody puts up

01:13:25.660 --> 01:13:29.650
the money to take some really
poor Irish Catholic kids

01:13:29.650 --> 01:13:34.210
in Belfast, and some really poor
Irish Protestant kids in there

01:13:34.210 --> 01:13:36.570
during the worst of
the civil unrest there.

01:13:36.570 --> 01:13:39.820
And they get to go to someplace
wonderful and far away.

01:13:39.820 --> 01:13:42.730
And they all go to
summer camp together.

01:13:42.730 --> 01:13:45.220
And they have teams that
are mixtures of the kids

01:13:45.220 --> 01:13:46.340
by different religions.

01:13:46.340 --> 01:13:47.480
And they're growing.

01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:50.390
They're growing to recognize
each other as individuals.

01:13:50.390 --> 01:13:53.010
Or the versions, lots of
which have been tried,

01:13:53.010 --> 01:13:58.030
of sort of retreats or even
camps of Palestinian teenagers,

01:13:58.030 --> 01:13:59.560
Israeli teenagers.

01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:01.210
These are the leaders
in the future.

01:14:01.210 --> 01:14:03.860
They will go back and
have learned they're not

01:14:03.860 --> 01:14:05.340
so different after all.

01:14:05.340 --> 01:14:07.220
They're kind of just like us.

01:14:07.220 --> 01:14:09.030
What those studies
have generally shown

01:14:09.030 --> 01:14:10.720
is that doesn't work.

01:14:10.720 --> 01:14:12.650
It works for only
a little while.

01:14:12.650 --> 01:14:16.130
You can't just pull it off
on a two-week camping trip.

01:14:16.130 --> 01:14:18.420
It takes more
sustained exposure.

01:14:18.420 --> 01:14:23.620
It basically requires growing
up in, or living sustainedly in.

01:14:23.620 --> 01:14:25.630
So that's been a disappointment.

01:14:25.630 --> 01:14:28.280
One additional disappointment
with the contact theory

01:14:28.280 --> 01:14:38.510
literature, which is one of the
papers, which again I think I

01:14:38.510 --> 01:14:39.770
put in the suggested reading.

01:14:39.770 --> 01:14:41.830
OK, so you've got
two different groups,

01:14:41.830 --> 01:14:44.240
two different populations,
two different ethnicities,

01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:45.160
whatever.

01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:48.440
And they are living in
generally the same area,

01:14:48.440 --> 01:14:52.650
but nonetheless segregated
within group in smaller areas.

01:14:52.650 --> 01:14:57.270
One scenario-- here's the region
where these two groups live.

01:14:57.270 --> 01:15:00.650
And there's an absolute
boundary between them.

01:15:00.650 --> 01:15:04.450
Here, instead, there's sort
of an undulating boundary.

01:15:04.450 --> 01:15:05.630
It's less clear.

01:15:05.630 --> 01:15:09.240
And, critically, there
is more surface area.

01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:12.860
There is more interfaces
between the two groups.

01:15:12.860 --> 01:15:16.320
There's more domains
of experiencing people

01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:17.840
from the other group.

01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:20.810
Finally, versions
where instead you

01:15:20.810 --> 01:15:24.350
have pockets of different
groups embedded in other ones.

01:15:24.350 --> 01:15:27.120
And that being a completely
different scenario

01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:31.770
where, in fact, you maximize the
perimeter that you get there.

01:15:31.770 --> 01:15:33.450
And what's been shown
in this one study

01:15:33.450 --> 01:15:37.320
that I recommended that you
guys look at is the more

01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:40.450
contact, the more
interfaces, between the two

01:15:40.450 --> 01:15:44.380
groups and living situations
doesn't guarantee that people

01:15:44.380 --> 01:15:45.830
will get along better.

01:15:45.830 --> 01:15:48.790
What you will find is there's
intermediate points where

01:15:48.790 --> 01:15:52.390
the contact profile
increases aggression,

01:15:52.390 --> 01:15:55.100
because what it does
is you just barely

01:15:55.100 --> 01:15:59.100
have a critical mass
of people on your side

01:15:59.100 --> 01:16:02.510
to be an effective group
to fight with them.

01:16:02.510 --> 01:16:04.390
You see totally
different outcomes,

01:16:04.390 --> 01:16:06.980
depending on the
spatial characteristics

01:16:06.980 --> 01:16:07.930
of the subgrouping.

01:16:07.930 --> 01:16:09.890
And what the people
showed in this paper was

01:16:09.890 --> 01:16:13.120
they then analyzed the
different ethnic distributions

01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:17.190
in the Balkans, the Bosnian
War, the Croatians, all of that,

01:16:17.190 --> 01:16:20.740
and seeing that this was
extremely predictive of where

01:16:20.740 --> 01:16:24.500
the violence took place in
terms of where you had what they

01:16:24.500 --> 01:16:29.000
viewed as the least optimal
set of interfaces of contact

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:30.010
between groups.

01:16:30.010 --> 01:16:33.120
More contact is not
necessarily always equal,

01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:35.750
more understanding and
we're all just the same.

01:16:35.750 --> 01:16:39.790
More contact can equal, in
some cases, more irritation,

01:16:39.790 --> 01:16:44.710
and more resources, and more
unity to do something about it.

01:16:44.710 --> 01:16:49.650
OK, more of pseudo kinship--
so this whole notion, again,

01:16:49.650 --> 01:16:52.190
of pseudo kinship,
we are species

01:16:52.190 --> 01:16:53.900
where we're not
recognizing individuals

01:16:53.900 --> 01:16:55.260
by smell, all of that.

01:16:55.260 --> 01:16:57.252
We're doing that
cognition stuff.

01:16:57.252 --> 01:16:58.960
But don't forget the
[? kibbutz ?] study.

01:16:58.960 --> 01:17:00.800
But we're doing that
cognition stuff.

01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:03.080
And, thus, we can
do pseudo kinship.

01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:05.550
And, thus, we could
be manipulated

01:17:05.550 --> 01:17:09.390
by powers that be, by
governments, by religions,

01:17:09.390 --> 01:17:12.700
and to viewing non-relatives
as more related to us,

01:17:12.700 --> 01:17:13.500
and all of that.

01:17:13.500 --> 01:17:16.680
These are very
abstract processes.

01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:20.470
And it brings up another realm,
an extremely abstract realm,

01:17:20.470 --> 01:17:24.614
that pushes for more
cooperation and less violence.

01:17:24.614 --> 01:17:26.280
And this goes back
to what I was talking

01:17:26.280 --> 01:17:29.630
about the other day, the
neurobiology of symbols,

01:17:29.630 --> 01:17:32.180
how we code for certain
types of symbols,

01:17:32.180 --> 01:17:33.870
certain metaphors in our brain.

01:17:33.870 --> 01:17:35.550
And that's back to
that whole world

01:17:35.550 --> 01:17:37.940
of, you're using the
same part of the brain

01:17:37.940 --> 01:17:41.650
for disgusting food and
moral disgust, warm drink,

01:17:41.650 --> 01:17:45.282
warm personality, that
weird concrete literalness.

01:17:45.282 --> 01:17:47.240
Because you've got a
pretty metaphors somewhere

01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:49.310
when humans started
developing them,

01:17:49.310 --> 01:17:51.520
the outcome of that
being that metaphors

01:17:51.520 --> 01:17:54.750
can be extraordinarily powerful.

01:17:54.750 --> 01:17:56.500
And a number of
researchers-- probably

01:17:56.500 --> 01:17:59.320
the person most visible in
this realm, an economist

01:17:59.320 --> 01:18:01.780
University of Michigan
named Robert Axelrod

01:18:01.780 --> 01:18:04.770
as doing a whole lot of
work showing, in a sense,

01:18:04.770 --> 01:18:08.040
the importance of
symbols in peacemaking.

01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:10.020
And it makes perfect sense.

01:18:10.020 --> 01:18:13.060
You take the extreme
rationalist view

01:18:13.060 --> 01:18:15.490
of humans as economic machines.

01:18:15.490 --> 01:18:18.250
And what peacemaking is
going to be purely about

01:18:18.250 --> 01:18:21.300
is figuring out
contested resources

01:18:21.300 --> 01:18:23.780
and how they are going
to be divided up.

01:18:23.780 --> 01:18:25.620
And what Axelrod
and others show,

01:18:25.620 --> 01:18:29.700
instead, is this whole
irrational realm of,

01:18:29.700 --> 01:18:33.520
be respectful of
somebody else's symbols.

01:18:33.520 --> 01:18:36.700
And figuring out how you're
going to divide up the land

01:18:36.700 --> 01:18:39.070
suddenly becomes a
lot less important--

01:18:39.070 --> 01:18:43.590
the power of symbols over
rational contested resources.

01:18:43.590 --> 01:18:47.040
And he studied things like
how a critical thing that

01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:50.280
happened in peace coming
to Northern Ireland

01:18:50.280 --> 01:18:54.580
was at one juncture a bunch
of the Sinn Fein, however

01:18:54.580 --> 01:18:58.510
that's pronounced, the
ex-military wing of the IRA

01:18:58.510 --> 01:19:01.500
that were just beginning
to have extremely

01:19:01.500 --> 01:19:06.180
mistrustful negotiations with
some of the Protestant unions

01:19:06.180 --> 01:19:06.900
and all of that.

01:19:06.900 --> 01:19:09.210
They did something outrageous.

01:19:09.210 --> 01:19:12.100
They sent a 50th
wedding anniversary gift

01:19:12.100 --> 01:19:16.180
to this guy Ian Paisley,
who was the murderous head

01:19:16.180 --> 01:19:18.950
of the Protestant
death squads there.

01:19:18.950 --> 01:19:21.400
Somebody just
decided to try this.

01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:24.590
And this was a
massive breakthrough.

01:19:24.590 --> 01:19:27.830
Anyone who saw that movie
Invictus or have read about,

01:19:27.830 --> 01:19:30.140
the utter brilliance
of Nelson Mandela,

01:19:30.140 --> 01:19:32.920
of having spent his
time in prison learning

01:19:32.920 --> 01:19:35.650
to be completely
fluent in Afrikaans

01:19:35.650 --> 01:19:39.180
so that when he was sitting
down and starting to negotiate

01:19:39.180 --> 01:19:42.690
with these people, the fact that
he could sit there and speak

01:19:42.690 --> 01:19:44.480
in their language,
a language that

01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:47.390
is so laden with
symbolic importance

01:19:47.390 --> 01:19:51.710
to Afrikaners, that that
was a gigantic symbolic coup

01:19:51.710 --> 01:19:53.970
of Mandela embracing
the sport that

01:19:53.970 --> 01:19:57.220
was the very symbol of
apartheid, of Mandela doing

01:19:57.220 --> 01:19:59.800
very subtle things
that a number of people

01:19:59.800 --> 01:20:02.270
pointed out who were
involved in the negotiations.

01:20:02.270 --> 01:20:05.330
OK, Mandela, just when
he's gotten out of prison,

01:20:05.330 --> 01:20:07.550
and he's about to meet
with some of the leaders

01:20:07.550 --> 01:20:10.170
of the government, and some of
the most right wing opponents

01:20:10.170 --> 01:20:11.290
to any sort of peace.

01:20:11.290 --> 01:20:13.300
And so we need a
conference room.

01:20:13.300 --> 01:20:15.090
And, no, that's not what he did.

01:20:15.090 --> 01:20:19.170
He insisted they would have the
meetings in his home, his home

01:20:19.170 --> 01:20:21.040
that he had just returned to.

01:20:21.040 --> 01:20:24.110
OK, well let's clear off
the dining room table.

01:20:24.110 --> 01:20:26.190
No, that's not what he did.

01:20:26.190 --> 01:20:29.440
He would insist they did this
in the living room, where

01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:33.180
they would sit down on
stuffed armchairs and couches.

01:20:33.180 --> 01:20:36.180
And something that he did,
apparently, always at these

01:20:36.180 --> 01:20:40.050
is he would sit down on the
couch, and gesture to whoever

01:20:40.050 --> 01:20:43.275
was likely to be the
most impossible foe,

01:20:43.275 --> 01:20:44.730
and say, come sit next to me.

01:20:44.730 --> 01:20:46.340
Sit next to me on the couch.

01:20:46.340 --> 01:20:49.890
And would proceed to jump
up at various points to say,

01:20:49.890 --> 01:20:51.580
can I get you some more tea?

01:20:51.580 --> 01:20:53.720
Do you want some more--
there would be food.

01:20:53.720 --> 01:20:54.790
There would be biscuits.

01:20:54.790 --> 01:20:58.010
There would be whatever--
brilliant, brilliant use

01:20:58.010 --> 01:20:59.090
of symbols.

01:20:59.090 --> 01:21:00.700
If I'm sitting
here, and this guy

01:21:00.700 --> 01:21:03.920
keeps jumping up and getting
me more cookies just when I

01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:06.530
was getting a hankering
for some more cookies,

01:21:06.530 --> 01:21:09.150
maybe not so
different after all.

01:21:09.150 --> 01:21:12.160
People who get cookies
for other people

01:21:12.160 --> 01:21:15.410
make the world more peaceful,
or something or other.

01:21:15.410 --> 01:21:17.610
What Axelrod has also
shown in some of his work

01:21:17.610 --> 01:21:20.910
is the potential for it--
really interesting stuff.

01:21:20.910 --> 01:21:23.960
He will, for example, he
and people working with him,

01:21:23.960 --> 01:21:28.390
have interviewed, say, Hamas
leaders in Palestinian,

01:21:28.390 --> 01:21:32.710
and the Gaza, and the West
Bank, some of the most

01:21:32.710 --> 01:21:36.380
opposed to the existence of
Israel, most confrontational

01:21:36.380 --> 01:21:36.880
of groups.

01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:40.660
And he gets quotes from their
leaders along the lines of,

01:21:40.660 --> 01:21:43.840
if the Israelis would
ever once just say,

01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:46.390
we got screwed in 1948.

01:21:46.390 --> 01:21:48.120
And we're sorry it happened.

01:21:48.120 --> 01:21:50.290
We would be willing
to make peace.

01:21:50.290 --> 01:21:53.412
And then he goes and talks
to some Israeli generals

01:21:53.412 --> 01:21:55.120
who are some of the
most right wing ones.

01:21:55.120 --> 01:21:56.240
He selects them for that.

01:21:56.240 --> 01:21:57.310
And they sit there.

01:21:57.310 --> 01:22:01.150
And they say stuff like, if the
damn Palestinians would ever

01:22:01.150 --> 01:22:04.380
just get the anti-Semitic
garbage out of their school

01:22:04.380 --> 01:22:07.430
books, we'd be able to
think seriously about peace

01:22:07.430 --> 01:22:08.320
the next day.

01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:10.260
It's not about water rights.

01:22:10.260 --> 01:22:12.690
It's not about return of land.

01:22:12.690 --> 01:22:15.510
It's just about, are
they going to respect

01:22:15.510 --> 01:22:18.880
our symbols and the
legitimacy of our history,

01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:20.640
and the accuracy of it?

01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:25.490
Enormously, potentially
powerful interventions there.

01:22:25.490 --> 01:22:30.730
OK, so kin selection-- most
importantly, pseudo kinship.

01:22:30.730 --> 01:22:33.260
Moving on now--
reciprocal altruism.

01:22:33.260 --> 01:22:36.490
Where does that come in, in
terms of potentially making

01:22:36.490 --> 01:22:37.520
for more peace?

01:22:37.520 --> 01:22:39.660
And what's clear
is, in principle,

01:22:39.660 --> 01:22:43.320
it should never do it if you
are playing only a single round

01:22:43.320 --> 01:22:45.810
of a game with someone, a
game in the prisoner's dilemma

01:22:45.810 --> 01:22:49.850
sense, because there's
absolutely no reason

01:22:49.850 --> 01:22:52.390
to cooperate,
because you are never

01:22:52.390 --> 01:22:54.190
going to face the person again.

01:22:54.190 --> 01:22:56.840
And this is something that was
called by a zoologist Garret

01:22:56.840 --> 01:22:59.790
Hardin the tragedy
of the commons,

01:22:59.790 --> 01:23:02.660
and the circumstance
of shared resources

01:23:02.660 --> 01:23:07.160
but limited responsibility, and
limited repeated interactions.

01:23:07.160 --> 01:23:09.510
You have to select
for selfishness.

01:23:09.510 --> 01:23:13.180
You have to select for what
is termed a Nash equilibrium,

01:23:13.180 --> 01:23:15.520
where the only possible
rational thing to do

01:23:15.520 --> 01:23:17.910
there is to not cooperate.

01:23:17.910 --> 01:23:20.580
So how do you ever
get cooperation

01:23:20.580 --> 01:23:24.270
to evolve in groups
of organisms?

01:23:24.270 --> 01:23:28.450
So back to the same Axelrod,
his work with computer

01:23:28.450 --> 01:23:30.290
tournaments there,
with a tit for tat,

01:23:30.290 --> 01:23:33.070
seeing that under some
circumstances one of them

01:23:33.070 --> 01:23:33.880
can dominate.

01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:35.610
Tit for tat is a
great optimal one.

01:23:35.610 --> 01:23:37.700
In the real world,
though, how do you ever

01:23:37.700 --> 01:23:40.230
jump start cooperation?

01:23:40.230 --> 01:23:43.100
How do you ever get one
of those strategies going

01:23:43.100 --> 01:23:46.650
when the starting state is
complete lack of cooperation?

01:23:46.650 --> 01:23:50.210
We already know one example,
which is founder populations,

01:23:50.210 --> 01:23:53.770
that whole business about get
an isolated population has

01:23:53.770 --> 01:23:57.340
a higher coefficient
of relatedness, inbred,

01:23:57.340 --> 01:23:58.800
out of kin selection.

01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:00.790
Establish high degrees
of cooperation.

01:24:00.790 --> 01:24:01.670
They come back.

01:24:01.670 --> 01:24:05.405
And it's this group
selection phenomenon of,

01:24:05.405 --> 01:24:07.570
you better become as
cooperative as them.

01:24:07.570 --> 01:24:10.240
Or you're not going
to be able to compete.

01:24:10.240 --> 01:24:12.090
And you could see
the same exact thing

01:24:12.090 --> 01:24:15.030
in circumstances where
it is not a founder

01:24:15.030 --> 01:24:17.250
effect of a population
goes away for a while

01:24:17.250 --> 01:24:20.590
and then comes back, but where
a population is functioning

01:24:20.590 --> 01:24:24.490
in that way amid a sea
of non-cooperators.

01:24:24.490 --> 01:24:27.280
In New York City
in the 1980s, there

01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:29.760
was this totally
weird phenomenon

01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:32.600
in that there were
two ethnic groups that

01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:35.250
were moving into New York
at a much higher rate

01:24:35.250 --> 01:24:37.250
than in the past--
Korean immigrants

01:24:37.250 --> 01:24:38.470
and Lebanese immigrants.

01:24:38.470 --> 01:24:41.450
And both groups happened to
gravitate towards grocery

01:24:41.450 --> 01:24:45.320
stores-- the Korean community
fruit, vegetable stands,

01:24:45.320 --> 01:24:48.570
the Lebanese community more
regular old grocery stores.

01:24:48.570 --> 01:24:51.890
And they were
incredibly successful.

01:24:51.890 --> 01:24:54.480
And these popped up
all over the place.

01:24:54.480 --> 01:24:58.080
And the people who already
had the fruit and vegetable

01:24:58.080 --> 01:25:01.020
stands and stuff started
complaining that they

01:25:01.020 --> 01:25:03.420
were at an unfair disadvantage.

01:25:03.420 --> 01:25:04.220
How come?

01:25:04.220 --> 01:25:07.670
Because these Korean
shop owners would

01:25:07.670 --> 01:25:09.230
cooperate with each other.

01:25:09.230 --> 01:25:12.070
They would give each
other interest-free loans.

01:25:12.070 --> 01:25:14.150
That's not fair.

01:25:14.150 --> 01:25:16.690
That's not fair that they're
being nice to each other.

01:25:16.690 --> 01:25:18.190
We can't compete.

01:25:18.190 --> 01:25:20.970
And the same thing with the
Lebanese grocery owners,

01:25:20.970 --> 01:25:23.990
that you had people
doing reciprocal altruism

01:25:23.990 --> 01:25:25.400
in a community of trust.

01:25:25.400 --> 01:25:27.150
And what they were
immediately doing

01:25:27.150 --> 01:25:30.360
was out competing
the non-cooperators.

01:25:30.360 --> 01:25:35.190
And amid these bizarre demands
for, like, banning Korean fruit

01:25:35.190 --> 01:25:37.560
and vegetable stands,
or some-- like,

01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:39.860
this was a point
of great hostility

01:25:39.860 --> 01:25:41.630
during that period
in New York City

01:25:41.630 --> 01:25:43.950
because those people
were cheating.

01:25:43.950 --> 01:25:45.980
They cooperated with each other.

01:25:45.980 --> 01:25:47.810
So either join in.

01:25:47.810 --> 01:25:50.770
Or you will be
driven to extinction.

01:25:50.770 --> 01:25:52.350
So that is one possibility.

01:25:52.350 --> 01:25:55.760
What are the other circumstances
in formal game theory

01:25:55.760 --> 01:26:00.000
play that favors the
emergence of cooperation?

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:03.160
Critical one--
repetition, that you're

01:26:03.160 --> 01:26:07.380
going to play against this
individual more than just once.

01:26:07.380 --> 01:26:10.270
If it's run time, it's
tragedy of the commons.

01:26:10.270 --> 01:26:16.400
There is absolutely no reason
to select for cooperation.

01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:19.710
Repeated interactions,
and it opens up

01:26:19.710 --> 01:26:22.590
the possibility of
you being punished

01:26:22.590 --> 01:26:25.180
for being a cheater,
what they call

01:26:25.180 --> 01:26:29.810
the shadow of
future retribution.

01:26:29.810 --> 01:26:32.340
One qualifier with
that, though-- you

01:26:32.340 --> 01:26:34.940
need to have multiple
rounds of interactions.

01:26:34.940 --> 01:26:38.650
But it can't be a
known number of rounds.

01:26:38.650 --> 01:26:41.740
You can't know how many
rounds it's going to be.

01:26:41.740 --> 01:26:43.480
Think through this.

01:26:43.480 --> 01:26:46.540
You know that this is
the very last round

01:26:46.540 --> 01:26:48.010
you are going to play.

01:26:48.010 --> 01:26:51.230
And what's the only logical
thing to do is to cheat?

01:26:51.230 --> 01:26:53.360
The very last round
functions as if it

01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:56.960
was a tragedy of the commons
single game, single round game.

01:26:56.960 --> 01:26:58.610
So the only logical
thing to do is

01:26:58.610 --> 01:27:00.740
to cheat in the very last round.

01:27:00.740 --> 01:27:03.050
In which case, the only
logical thing to do

01:27:03.050 --> 01:27:05.190
is to cheat in the
next to the last round,

01:27:05.190 --> 01:27:06.310
and the next to the last.

01:27:06.310 --> 01:27:09.540
A known number of
rounds of interactions

01:27:09.540 --> 01:27:12.610
immediately does in
cooperation because it sort of

01:27:12.610 --> 01:27:17.320
flows backwards with this
collapse of the system.

01:27:17.320 --> 01:27:20.460
The next thing that favors it
is what is called open book

01:27:20.460 --> 01:27:23.210
play by people in the
business, which is you

01:27:23.210 --> 01:27:26.730
will be playing against a
number of different individuals,

01:27:26.730 --> 01:27:29.840
and pairs, cycling through.

01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:31.320
And the critical
thing is when you

01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:34.030
begin to play with
someone else, they

01:27:34.030 --> 01:27:38.590
can know your record as to how
you played in previous games.

01:27:38.590 --> 01:27:42.230
In other words, once
you bring in reputation,

01:27:42.230 --> 01:27:45.750
when reputation can be
possible, suddenly you

01:27:45.750 --> 01:27:48.640
select for cooperation.

01:27:48.640 --> 01:27:53.280
Next, what's shown is that
if you have people playing

01:27:53.280 --> 01:27:55.250
in multiple games
with each other,

01:27:55.250 --> 01:27:57.190
especially when
they're unsynchronized,

01:27:57.190 --> 01:27:59.610
you select for
cooperation as well.

01:27:59.610 --> 01:28:00.930
What's this about?

01:28:00.930 --> 01:28:04.580
What you do is if one of
the games makes it very,

01:28:04.580 --> 01:28:07.670
very easy in terms of
payoff for cooperation

01:28:07.670 --> 01:28:10.660
to get established,
if you intermix rounds

01:28:10.660 --> 01:28:14.440
of that game with a game in
which there is very little

01:28:14.440 --> 01:28:17.860
motivation for cooperation
starting, what you see

01:28:17.860 --> 01:28:20.390
is a psychological bleed over.

01:28:20.390 --> 01:28:23.890
If you are cooperating with
this person in this game, which

01:28:23.890 --> 01:28:26.360
is now done here now
down here, it greatly

01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:29.920
increases the odds of one doing
the other game of beginning

01:28:29.920 --> 01:28:31.620
to cooperate as well.

01:28:31.620 --> 01:28:33.920
Multiple games, and
it does not take

01:28:33.920 --> 01:28:37.070
much to see that this is
more like the real world

01:28:37.070 --> 01:28:40.840
than playing prisoner's dilemma
with one single individual.

01:28:40.840 --> 01:28:44.520
Next, the possibility
of punishing someone

01:28:44.520 --> 01:28:45.780
when they are a creep.

01:28:45.780 --> 01:28:47.930
And that's what we
heard about before, what

01:28:47.930 --> 01:28:51.000
is termed now in the field
altruistic punishment.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.440
If somebody does
something crummy to you,

01:28:53.440 --> 01:28:55.550
you are allowed to
expend a certain amount

01:28:55.550 --> 01:28:59.120
of your resources to take
more of the resources

01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:00.650
away from them.

01:29:00.650 --> 01:29:02.880
That selects for cooperation.

01:29:02.880 --> 01:29:05.120
Something that
even selects faster

01:29:05.120 --> 01:29:08.380
is second party
altruistic punishing.

01:29:08.380 --> 01:29:10.900
You are not taking
part in the game.

01:29:10.900 --> 01:29:12.770
You're watching these
two individuals,

01:29:12.770 --> 01:29:15.680
But you have the power to
use some of your resources

01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:19.580
to punish a cheater--
an outside enforcer.

01:29:19.580 --> 01:29:23.760
That selects for
cooperation even faster.

01:29:23.760 --> 01:29:27.360
Then something that is even
more effective, which is

01:29:27.360 --> 01:29:30.620
termed secondary
altruistic punishing.

01:29:30.620 --> 01:29:32.080
Here's what you do.

01:29:32.080 --> 01:29:35.310
What you do is
people are observers

01:29:35.310 --> 01:29:37.970
of other people's interactions,
and seeing if they're cheating.

01:29:37.970 --> 01:29:40.177
And they can do some
altruistic punishment

01:29:40.177 --> 01:29:42.510
if they think this individual
is a jerk and all of that.

01:29:42.510 --> 01:29:43.970
But here's what you do.

01:29:43.970 --> 01:29:47.250
If there is a circumstance
where somebody cheats

01:29:47.250 --> 01:29:51.270
and this third party
individual doesn't punish them,

01:29:51.270 --> 01:29:53.230
they get punished.

01:29:53.230 --> 01:29:54.690
What's that about?

01:29:54.690 --> 01:29:56.920
That's honor code violations.

01:29:56.920 --> 01:29:59.270
That's the expectation
that you are

01:29:59.270 --> 01:30:01.850
supposed to report someone
who has had an honor code

01:30:01.850 --> 01:30:02.670
violation.

01:30:02.670 --> 01:30:05.470
And if you don't, you
will get punished.

01:30:05.470 --> 01:30:09.230
That selects for cooperation
really fast also.

01:30:09.230 --> 01:30:12.660
And all of these-- these have
been computer tournaments,

01:30:12.660 --> 01:30:13.690
and all of that.

01:30:13.690 --> 01:30:16.440
You know that world
of research by now.

01:30:16.440 --> 01:30:19.750
Finally, more subtle
stuff, gives the person

01:30:19.750 --> 01:30:22.070
the opportunity to
drop out of the game,

01:30:22.070 --> 01:30:23.620
to secede from the game.

01:30:23.620 --> 01:30:26.920
Give the person the opportunity
to not play against you,

01:30:26.920 --> 01:30:29.750
but to choose, I'll play against
all these other individuals,

01:30:29.750 --> 01:30:30.830
but not that one.

01:30:30.830 --> 01:30:32.810
Begin to put that
power in there.

01:30:32.810 --> 01:30:37.220
And you select for
cooperation that much faster.

01:30:37.220 --> 01:30:40.690
So that's some good news.

01:30:40.690 --> 01:30:44.030
Final level, the group selection
level-- group selection

01:30:44.030 --> 01:30:46.270
not in our behaving for
the good of the species,

01:30:46.270 --> 01:30:49.240
but as we know the more
modern version of it,

01:30:49.240 --> 01:30:51.150
selection for
traits that are only

01:30:51.150 --> 01:30:54.400
manifest at the level
of whole groups.

01:30:54.400 --> 01:30:59.710
A always loses to B. But groups
of A always defeat groups of B.

01:30:59.710 --> 01:31:01.340
All of the stuff
we've been seeing,

01:31:01.340 --> 01:31:05.360
people suddenly cooperating with
each other as a small group,

01:31:05.360 --> 01:31:08.530
and driving the non-cooperators
out of business,

01:31:08.530 --> 01:31:11.780
that's a group selection
argument going on there.

01:31:11.780 --> 01:31:14.880
So you can have that as
a means for generating

01:31:14.880 --> 01:31:16.390
a lot of cooperation.

01:31:16.390 --> 01:31:17.390
That's great.

01:31:17.390 --> 01:31:19.170
That makes the world
a better place,

01:31:19.170 --> 01:31:21.630
unless there is
a downside to it.

01:31:21.630 --> 01:31:24.580
And back to
chimpanzees, what do you

01:31:24.580 --> 01:31:27.390
have when a bunch
of related chimps

01:31:27.390 --> 01:31:31.180
are having not individual fights
with males from the next valley

01:31:31.180 --> 01:31:33.110
over, but functioning
as a group?

01:31:33.110 --> 01:31:36.060
You are having an example
of group selection, which

01:31:36.060 --> 01:31:40.380
thus brings up one of the
most profoundly scary things

01:31:40.380 --> 01:31:42.380
on this planet,
which is when you've

01:31:42.380 --> 01:31:43.970
got a bunch of males
who are getting

01:31:43.970 --> 01:31:45.522
along well with each other.

01:31:45.522 --> 01:31:47.480
And they're beginning to
look at the neighbors,

01:31:47.480 --> 01:31:50.250
because lots of males
cooperating together

01:31:50.250 --> 01:31:52.370
can make for some
very bad neighbors.

01:31:52.370 --> 01:31:55.130
As some people in the
field have emphasized,

01:31:55.130 --> 01:31:57.740
a decrease in homicide
within a group

01:31:57.740 --> 01:32:01.660
is a prerequisite for inventing
genocide between groups.

01:32:01.660 --> 01:32:05.530
So group selection is not always
this magical founder effect

01:32:05.530 --> 01:32:08.240
of everybody wanting to
learn the new folk songs.

01:32:08.240 --> 01:32:10.190
What you've got instead
are circumstances

01:32:10.190 --> 01:32:12.810
where it can go very wrong.

01:32:12.810 --> 01:32:16.530
Final amazing example
showing the emergence

01:32:16.530 --> 01:32:19.340
of cooperation--
and this was not

01:32:19.340 --> 01:32:21.000
a game theory demonstration.

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:22.460
This was not an experiment.

01:32:22.460 --> 01:32:25.340
This was a real
event that happened,

01:32:25.340 --> 01:32:27.320
and an extraordinary one.

01:32:27.320 --> 01:32:32.040
This occurred during World
War I. A lot of people

01:32:32.040 --> 01:32:34.310
have heard about a phenomenon
that happened there,

01:32:34.310 --> 01:32:37.680
a historical incident
that was very, very cruel,

01:32:37.680 --> 01:32:41.220
but pales in comparison to
what I'm about to tell about.

01:32:41.220 --> 01:32:45.220
In 1914, the first Christmas
of World War I, somehow

01:32:45.220 --> 01:32:46.970
the decision was made
that there was going

01:32:46.970 --> 01:32:49.010
to be a truce on Christmas Day.

01:32:49.010 --> 01:32:51.600
All of the fighting up
and down the trenches

01:32:51.600 --> 01:32:53.830
was going to cease for 24 hours.

01:32:53.830 --> 01:32:55.410
And it has been documented.

01:32:55.410 --> 01:32:58.130
It was amazing and bizarre.

01:32:58.130 --> 01:33:00.810
Men out of the
trenches playing soccer

01:33:00.810 --> 01:33:04.580
with each other from different
sides-- a bunch of German

01:33:04.580 --> 01:33:08.570
and French guys playing against
some British and German guys

01:33:08.570 --> 01:33:11.850
on the other side,
people exchanging gifts,

01:33:11.850 --> 01:33:15.100
people exchanging
helmets as souvenirs,

01:33:15.100 --> 01:33:18.170
people singing together,
people getting drunk together

01:33:18.170 --> 01:33:19.970
from the two opposite sides.

01:33:19.970 --> 01:33:22.620
And, eventually,
when the officers

01:33:22.620 --> 01:33:24.790
got them to go
back to their job,

01:33:24.790 --> 01:33:29.490
they returned to trying to kill
each other-- amazing, bizarre

01:33:29.490 --> 01:33:29.990
incident.

01:33:29.990 --> 01:33:32.850
What was very striking
about it is it extended,

01:33:32.850 --> 01:33:35.320
actually, two or three
days extra longer than

01:33:35.320 --> 01:33:37.400
planned because the
officers couldn't

01:33:37.400 --> 01:33:40.180
get people to stop doing this.

01:33:40.180 --> 01:33:41.370
That's very cool.

01:33:41.370 --> 01:33:45.190
But that's an outside
force already establishing

01:33:45.190 --> 01:33:46.570
the cooperation.

01:33:46.570 --> 01:33:49.690
Here's something much,
much more impressive.

01:33:49.690 --> 01:33:51.610
And this happened
in World War I.

01:33:51.610 --> 01:33:54.280
And it didn't take a bunch of
generals or heads of states

01:33:54.280 --> 01:33:58.240
to negotiate a truce--
the way in which truces

01:33:58.240 --> 01:34:01.970
would spontaneously
merge over and over again

01:34:01.970 --> 01:34:03.660
across the trenches.

01:34:03.660 --> 01:34:07.010
How do you generate a
reciprocally altruistic

01:34:07.010 --> 01:34:09.530
cooperative relationship
with the enemy

01:34:09.530 --> 01:34:11.190
in the trenches
over there, where

01:34:11.190 --> 01:34:12.600
you don't speak
the same language

01:34:12.600 --> 01:34:14.640
and you don't even
see their faces?

01:34:14.640 --> 01:34:16.470
Here's what you do.

01:34:16.470 --> 01:34:18.530
You take your best gunner.

01:34:18.530 --> 01:34:21.740
And have him come
up and lob a shell

01:34:21.740 --> 01:34:26.090
20 yards behind the trench
there, and blow up a tree.

01:34:26.090 --> 01:34:30.150
Now have you gunner lob a shell
to hit the exact same spot

01:34:30.150 --> 01:34:32.870
again, and do it
again, and do it again.

01:34:32.870 --> 01:34:34.240
Do it a bunch of times.

01:34:34.240 --> 01:34:36.840
What are you communicating
to the other side?

01:34:36.840 --> 01:34:38.800
This guy's really good.

01:34:38.800 --> 01:34:42.780
And we're choosing not to put
the missile down on top of you.

01:34:42.780 --> 01:34:44.540
What are you going
to do about it?

01:34:44.540 --> 01:34:47.650
And then the other side would
get out their best gunner

01:34:47.650 --> 01:34:49.320
and do the thing in return.

01:34:49.320 --> 01:34:53.270
And you have just worked
out a non-aggression pact.

01:34:53.270 --> 01:34:55.710
And this occurred
over and over again

01:34:55.710 --> 01:34:58.840
in the trench warfare,
documented in letters

01:34:58.840 --> 01:35:01.730
by soldiers back home
to parents, saying,

01:35:01.730 --> 01:35:03.080
hi Mom and Dad.

01:35:03.080 --> 01:35:04.610
Things are OK here.

01:35:04.610 --> 01:35:06.360
I hope you're worrying
less, because we've

01:35:06.360 --> 01:35:07.740
worked out something.

01:35:07.740 --> 01:35:09.650
Things are a lot better here.

01:35:09.650 --> 01:35:12.430
There's a lot less
people getting hurt.

01:35:12.430 --> 01:35:16.100
Working it out along those
lines, working out a tit

01:35:16.100 --> 01:35:18.830
for tat vulnerability
where you had

01:35:18.830 --> 01:35:22.820
to have a forgiving tit
for tat, what if somebody

01:35:22.820 --> 01:35:24.910
messed up and
accidentally dropped

01:35:24.910 --> 01:35:27.510
a shell into the trench
on the other side?

01:35:27.510 --> 01:35:30.270
They got one shot back.

01:35:30.270 --> 01:35:33.270
Letters, dear Mom and
Dad, things are OK here.

01:35:33.270 --> 01:35:35.004
We had an incident
the other day.

01:35:35.004 --> 01:35:36.670
We had this new gunner
who didn't really

01:35:36.670 --> 01:35:38.240
understand how things worked.

01:35:38.240 --> 01:35:40.670
And I heard he killed
four people on their side.

01:35:40.670 --> 01:35:41.720
They shot one back.

01:35:41.720 --> 01:35:43.136
They took out three
of our people.

01:35:43.136 --> 01:35:44.940
But everything is OK now.

01:35:44.940 --> 01:35:48.250
Tit for tat, complete
with a forgiving element--

01:35:48.250 --> 01:35:51.490
this happened again,
and again, and again,

01:35:51.490 --> 01:35:52.860
in the trench warfare.

01:35:52.860 --> 01:35:55.750
And the only thing that
stopped it from spreading

01:35:55.750 --> 01:35:57.760
is the fact that
the officers kept

01:35:57.760 --> 01:36:00.450
insisting that nobody
else was doing this.

01:36:00.450 --> 01:36:03.130
And these guys were going to
get shot and court marshaled

01:36:03.130 --> 01:36:05.070
if they didn't stop this.

01:36:05.070 --> 01:36:08.190
And if they had only
had cell phones,

01:36:08.190 --> 01:36:11.100
if they only had
communication, if they only

01:36:11.100 --> 01:36:13.840
had a way of knowing
up and down the line

01:36:13.840 --> 01:36:16.170
that everybody was
doing this, they

01:36:16.170 --> 01:36:19.000
would have stopped the
war-- not with a treaty,

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.010
not with generals, not
with heads of state,

01:36:21.010 --> 01:36:23.710
not with diplomats,
but simply a bottom

01:36:23.710 --> 01:36:26.510
up way of evolving cooperation.

01:36:26.510 --> 01:36:28.340
And they would have
stopped the war

01:36:28.340 --> 01:36:31.030
if they knew that they
weren't the only ones wanting

01:36:31.030 --> 01:36:35.920
to do this-- amazing
historical incident.

01:36:35.920 --> 01:36:38.840
OK, so this gets us to
the end of aggression.

01:36:38.840 --> 01:36:41.640
As you probably noticed,
this has gone on way long.

01:36:41.640 --> 01:36:43.560
This is the longest
amount of material

01:36:43.560 --> 01:36:45.270
we spend on anything
in the course.

01:36:45.270 --> 01:36:47.700
And each year, it
actually gets longer.

01:36:47.700 --> 01:36:50.920
And I actually think I
know the reason for it.

01:36:50.920 --> 01:36:52.420
Three and a half
lectures ago, where

01:36:52.420 --> 01:36:56.280
did I start off talking
about my recent exposure

01:36:56.280 --> 01:36:58.520
to human aggression,
which was my doing it,

01:36:58.520 --> 01:37:00.670
and tripping up that
jerk playing soccer.

01:37:00.670 --> 01:37:02.570
And everybody was all excited.

01:37:02.570 --> 01:37:05.010
Let me tell you
about another time,

01:37:05.010 --> 01:37:06.620
the most serious
time I have ever been

01:37:06.620 --> 01:37:09.120
exposed to human aggression.

01:37:09.120 --> 01:37:11.686
This took place
when I was about 20.

01:37:11.686 --> 01:37:14.420
And this was first
year that I was

01:37:14.420 --> 01:37:16.200
doing research in East Africa.

01:37:16.200 --> 01:37:20.100
During that time, the famed
notorious dictator Idi Amin

01:37:20.100 --> 01:37:21.620
was running Uganda.

01:37:21.620 --> 01:37:23.930
And he was a nightmare.

01:37:23.930 --> 01:37:26.810
He was just killing
people left and right,

01:37:26.810 --> 01:37:30.270
destroying the country, as
documented, cannibalizing.

01:37:30.270 --> 01:37:32.670
Was a nightmare of a dictator.

01:37:32.670 --> 01:37:34.710
Around the time,
he made a mistake.

01:37:34.710 --> 01:37:39.359
This was spring of 1979, which
is he invaded Tanzania and took

01:37:39.359 --> 01:37:40.900
over some of the
land there, thinking

01:37:40.900 --> 01:37:42.660
the Tanzanians
wouldn't fight back.

01:37:42.660 --> 01:37:44.680
And he miscalculated.

01:37:44.680 --> 01:37:48.250
The Tanzania army
counterattacked, and drove them

01:37:48.250 --> 01:37:52.110
out of Uganda, and decided to
drive all the way to Kampala,

01:37:52.110 --> 01:37:53.440
the capital of Uganda.

01:37:53.440 --> 01:37:55.510
And they overthrew Idi Amin.

01:37:55.510 --> 01:37:56.930
He fled the country.

01:37:56.930 --> 01:37:59.210
And the country was liberated.

01:37:59.210 --> 01:38:00.590
They continued through there.

01:38:00.590 --> 01:38:03.610
And they opened up a corridor
to the Kenyan border.

01:38:03.610 --> 01:38:05.930
So it was now a swath all
through the southern part

01:38:05.930 --> 01:38:08.790
of the country that was
controlled by Tanzania.

01:38:08.790 --> 01:38:11.560
So the day after the
Tanzanians got things

01:38:11.560 --> 01:38:15.040
to the Kenyan border,
I went into Uganda.

01:38:15.040 --> 01:38:16.800
OK, why?

01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:19.340
This was amazing.

01:38:19.340 --> 01:38:20.630
This was history happening.

01:38:20.630 --> 01:38:23.870
You were hearing on the BBC
that people were dancing

01:38:23.870 --> 01:38:25.440
in the streets in Kampala.

01:38:25.440 --> 01:38:28.940
They had been liberated,
amazing chance to see history.

01:38:28.940 --> 01:38:30.550
This was-- through
our college, I

01:38:30.550 --> 01:38:33.240
had been spending a lot
of time with Quakers,

01:38:33.240 --> 01:38:36.160
and wrestling with those
issues, and figured

01:38:36.160 --> 01:38:38.530
if there is anything that
counts as a just war,

01:38:38.530 --> 01:38:39.370
this would be it.

01:38:39.370 --> 01:38:40.780
What does this seem like?

01:38:40.780 --> 01:38:42.692
All these philosophical
principles.

01:38:42.692 --> 01:38:44.900
This, actually, of course,
was not what was going on.

01:38:44.900 --> 01:38:47.360
I was a 20-year-old male.

01:38:47.360 --> 01:38:50.780
And somebody had been staying
with me, and no longer was.

01:38:50.780 --> 01:38:52.120
And I was all bummed out.

01:38:52.120 --> 01:38:55.370
And, thus, I did sort of
a very 20-year-old male

01:38:55.370 --> 01:38:58.400
adolescent primate thing,
which is figuring some violence

01:38:58.400 --> 01:39:00.960
would do some good things
for my brain neurochemistry.

01:39:00.960 --> 01:39:03.290
And I wanted to go see a war.

01:39:03.290 --> 01:39:05.910
So I went off to Uganda,
hitching through there.

01:39:05.910 --> 01:39:08.930
And it was
appropriately exciting.

01:39:08.930 --> 01:39:11.850
And some things happened that
scared the bejesus out of me.

01:39:11.850 --> 01:39:14.576
And at some point, I finally
decided I have had enough.

01:39:14.576 --> 01:39:15.700
I want to go back to Kenya.

01:39:15.700 --> 01:39:16.956
I want to feel safe again.

01:39:16.956 --> 01:39:17.830
So I'm hitching back.

01:39:17.830 --> 01:39:19.620
But I had one last
thing that I want

01:39:19.620 --> 01:39:21.930
to do, which was
since I was a kid,

01:39:21.930 --> 01:39:23.850
I had grown up reading
about the explorers,

01:39:23.850 --> 01:39:26.400
and the search for the source
of the Nile and all of that.

01:39:26.400 --> 01:39:30.210
The source of the white
Nile is in Uganda.

01:39:30.210 --> 01:39:34.020
It comes out of Lake Victoria
in a town called Tororo.

01:39:34.020 --> 01:39:36.250
And there's a spot
there, a bridge

01:39:36.250 --> 01:39:37.900
where you can go and stand.

01:39:37.900 --> 01:39:40.950
And here is where the
Nile River begins.

01:39:40.950 --> 01:39:43.080
And I had to see
this before leaving.

01:39:43.080 --> 01:39:45.160
And I managed to get
a ride into there.

01:39:45.160 --> 01:39:48.810
And I managed to get over to
this bridge, and stood there.

01:39:48.810 --> 01:39:52.179
And there was this
sort of dam thing

01:39:52.179 --> 01:39:53.970
that was built that
this bridge was on top.

01:39:53.970 --> 01:39:56.660
And there was this sluice where
all the water came spritzing

01:39:56.660 --> 01:39:58.160
out, and started the Nile.

01:39:58.160 --> 01:39:58.910
And I stood there.

01:39:58.910 --> 01:40:00.420
And I looked over the side.

01:40:00.420 --> 01:40:04.280
And what I saw was there
was a Ugandan soldier

01:40:04.280 --> 01:40:05.620
who had been taken down there.

01:40:05.620 --> 01:40:09.070
There was a staircase along the
side down to some sort of panel

01:40:09.070 --> 01:40:11.400
for controls or whatever.

01:40:11.400 --> 01:40:13.710
And a Ugandan soldier
had been taken down

01:40:13.710 --> 01:40:16.420
the steps, his hands
tied behind his back,

01:40:16.420 --> 01:40:18.470
and a rope tied
around his throat

01:40:18.470 --> 01:40:20.230
and attached to the panel.

01:40:20.230 --> 01:40:22.430
So that as the
water level rose, he

01:40:22.430 --> 01:40:24.530
would eventually be
swept off his feet

01:40:24.530 --> 01:40:28.310
and would be strangled
and drowned in the water.

01:40:28.310 --> 01:40:31.270
And this body had obviously
been there for days.

01:40:31.270 --> 01:40:32.580
It was bloated.

01:40:32.580 --> 01:40:33.970
It was floating there.

01:40:33.970 --> 01:40:35.940
It was being bashed
around on the waves.

01:40:35.940 --> 01:40:38.140
There were crocs
trying to get at it.

01:40:38.140 --> 01:40:42.750
And looking at this guy, a total
storm of emotions-- thinking,

01:40:42.750 --> 01:40:46.910
good, that's what you deserve
being in the army for Amin.

01:40:46.910 --> 01:40:48.380
Then thinking,
no, wait a second.

01:40:48.380 --> 01:40:50.630
This is probably some poor
guy who was forced to do it

01:40:50.630 --> 01:40:52.260
and was just following orders.

01:40:52.260 --> 01:40:54.810
Then thinking, no, I know
what I think of soldiers

01:40:54.810 --> 01:40:56.200
who just follow orders.

01:40:56.200 --> 01:40:58.560
Then thinking, whoa, I would
love to get a lot closer

01:40:58.560 --> 01:41:00.060
and see what's
happening down there.

01:41:00.060 --> 01:41:02.700
And thinking, I want to get as
far away from here as possible.

01:41:02.700 --> 01:41:05.320
And I stood there for
an hour and a half

01:41:05.320 --> 01:41:10.010
at that spot staring at this guy
until some Tanzanian soldiers

01:41:10.010 --> 01:41:11.750
chased me away from there.

01:41:11.750 --> 01:41:15.300
And I think now, 33
years later, that I

01:41:15.300 --> 01:41:18.800
lecture longer and longer about
aggression each year because

01:41:18.800 --> 01:41:20.390
of that guy.

01:41:20.390 --> 01:41:22.930
What do we do here
in our business?

01:41:22.930 --> 01:41:26.320
We have this general notion
that if we are rational,

01:41:26.320 --> 01:41:28.870
if we are learned,
if we are scholarly,

01:41:28.870 --> 01:41:31.640
if we respect thoughts
and truth and all of that,

01:41:31.640 --> 01:41:33.920
we will make the
world a better place.

01:41:33.920 --> 01:41:36.640
All of us who are professorial
have somewhere in there

01:41:36.640 --> 01:41:39.090
this totally ridiculous
belief that if you're

01:41:39.090 --> 01:41:41.770
allowed to lecture at
a subject long enough,

01:41:41.770 --> 01:41:43.580
it will give up and go away.

01:41:43.580 --> 01:41:45.630
And that will be the cure
for world aggression.

01:41:45.630 --> 01:41:47.300
If everybody can
only be lectured

01:41:47.300 --> 01:41:51.740
to about the frontal cortex,
it will solve world violence.

01:41:51.740 --> 01:41:54.280
But the basic problem
is that aggression is

01:41:54.280 --> 01:41:57.250
such a messy set of behaviors.

01:41:57.250 --> 01:42:00.900
Schizophrenia-- no question
about it, bad news.

01:42:00.900 --> 01:42:04.300
Alzheimer's disease, childhood
cancer, global warming,

01:42:04.300 --> 01:42:07.610
all of these
unassailably bad news.

01:42:07.610 --> 01:42:10.710
But aggression is a whole
lot more complicated,

01:42:10.710 --> 01:42:13.190
because of that point
where we started with,

01:42:13.190 --> 01:42:16.420
which is the same
exact behaviors,

01:42:16.420 --> 01:42:18.530
and depending on the
context, it could

01:42:18.530 --> 01:42:21.870
be something that would get
a medal for someone, someone

01:42:21.870 --> 01:42:25.890
you will want to mate with, vote
for, reward, cheer on, join in.

01:42:25.890 --> 01:42:28.220
And in another setting,
it is the most frightening

01:42:28.220 --> 01:42:30.070
possible thing that
can happen to us.

01:42:30.070 --> 01:42:33.510
And it's the same behaviors
in all those cases.

01:42:33.510 --> 01:42:36.250
And it's for that reason,
that violence is always

01:42:36.250 --> 01:42:38.800
going to be the hardest
subject for us to understand

01:42:38.800 --> 01:42:39.880
biologically.

01:42:39.880 --> 01:42:42.340
And it's for that
reason, that it's always

01:42:42.340 --> 01:42:46.340
going to be the one we have
to try hardest to understand.

01:42:46.340 --> 01:42:49.550

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:07.676
Stanford University.

00:00:07.676 --> 00:00:10.030
And we are not going
to work our way

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.820
through the behavior on the
right and march to the left.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.150
And instead, we'll
be trying to come up

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.880
with some ideas that are
going to apply to everything

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.370
we hear about in here.

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:27.680
And overall, these are probably
the most difficult lectures

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.340
of the course, the most
difficult material,

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.340
in part because I'm not sure
if I completely understand

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:34.690
what I'm talking about.

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.020
But also because
this is intrinsically

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.030
some really different ways
of thinking about things

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.850
in the realm of science.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.590
And that's one of
the reasons why

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.600
I forced you guys to
read this Chaos book.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.330
And again, as I think I
mentioned in the first lecture,

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:56.520
this incites a subset of
people to passionate enthusiasm

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.750
about the book.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.520
It incites another small subset
into just the most greatest

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.000
level of irritation
that this was assigned.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.550
And everybody else
is just vaguely

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.850
puzzled and kind of sort of
sees the point, but how come?

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.190
This book, when I first read
it, and so my first introduction

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.440
to the whole field, this
was like the first book

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.560
I had read where I finished it
and immediately started over

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.440
again, the first
one since, like,

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.460
Where the Wild Things Are
in terms of influence.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.910
This was an incredibly
challenging book

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.780
in terms of questioning
all the ways in which I

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.910
think about sort of
reductive science.

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.150
And hopefully, it will
do the same for you.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.160
And as part of it, posted, there
is the one and only homework

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.550
assignment in the
entire course, which,

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.410
just to make things easier, will
not be collected or looked at.

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:49.170
But what you should do is there
is a whole exercise up there

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.680
in generating something that
are called cellular automata.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:54.810
Do not panic yet.

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.370
There's plenty of time to panic.

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.600
Where you will be making
some of those on your own.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.310
And all I ask from
you guys in terms

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.280
of making sense of
these exercises is

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.600
do not sleep between
now and Friday.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.330
Spend all of your time working
on them, do nothing else.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.470
Take occasional breaks
to eat or the bathroom.

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.620
But other than that,
do nothing but this

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.100
between now and Friday.

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.010
And let's see how everybody
feels about it on Friday.

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.090
OK.

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.090
So picking up, where we
need to start off with

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.350
is trying to get a framework for
the standard Western approach

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.020
to understanding complicated
systems with scientific bases.

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:38.650
400 or so AD, Rome falls,
collapse of the Roman Empire,

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.550
entering an unbelievably dark
period in terms of ignorance,

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.620
in terms of the Dark
Ages throughout Europe,

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.940
the level at which
people did not

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.130
understand how the
world worked, the level

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.550
at which people had lost
knowledge from previous times.

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:57.750
Books were gone.

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.600
Philosophers were gone.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.370
The level of just isolation,
intellectual isolation,

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:04.760
was phenomenal.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.710
It was during that
period, it was

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:12.170
as if 500 years before people
had known the cure for cancer,

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.370
and for AIDS, and for being
able to fly on your own,

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.790
and all of that, and somehow
in the aftermath of the empire

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.030
falling apart, all of
that knowledge was lost.

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.040
Literacy went down the tubes.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.580
And this was a period that
gave rise to words like,

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.420
having an audit, having an
audit about your finances,

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.590
making an oral argument
before the judges,

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.110
having hearings about something
or other before the court.

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.940
Because all of these
were about speaking,

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.040
about auditory transmission
of information because nobody

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.450
could read anymore.

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.000
This was a period
where there was

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.650
no Western European language
that had the word progress

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.090
or ambition in it.

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.600
These were non-existent
concepts at the time.

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.240
Utter intellectual isolation,
utter social isolation,

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.570
during a time the vast
majority of people

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:09.000
lived in small villages, where
you would go 50 miles away

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.540
and people spoke a dialect
that you could not understand,

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.540
that degree of isolation.

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.100
Estimates are the
average person never went

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.750
more than 12 to 15
miles away from where

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.270
they were born in their entire
life, incredible isolation.

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.250
And incredible
ignorance ultimately

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:32.580
about how you explain causality
in the world because of all

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.150
of the information was gone.

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.820
Then something dramatic
changed in the year

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:43.190
1085, which is the first
European Christian conquest

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:47.560
of a major Islamic city, a
major Moorish one in this case,

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.170
Toledo in Spain.

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:53.000
Spain at the time, which was
Moorish and known as Alhambra

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.620
at the time, this
was the first city

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.830
to fall to Christian troops
since Islam swept in there.

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.860
And this was basically sort
of a second rate kind of city.

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.600
This was not some
major center, Toledo.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.760
But simply by
European forces having

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:14.230
captured that city, something
extraordinary happened, which

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:19.680
was within that city was a
library, with more books than

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.710
existed in all of Christian
Europe put together.

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:27.290
This simple library in this
sort out of the way podunk sort

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:29.610
of the city there
out in the boondocks,

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:33.070
one run-of-the-mill library
there had more cumulative

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:37.020
information than was available
to all of Europe at the time.

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:42.303
And suddenly, Europe got
to rediscover philosophers,

00:05:42.303 --> 00:05:44.700
Aristotle, Plato, all of that.

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:46.650
They got to rediscover logic.

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:50.220
They got to rediscover
all the great works.

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.460
Suddenly all of
those flooded back

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:55.870
into Europe and the
first beginnings of sort

00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:00.540
of a modern mindset about
complexity started to emerge.

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:04.480
People suddenly began to do
things, like able to think

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:08.720
transitive and
with transitivity,

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:14.750
in a transitive manner, where
you would see a is bigger

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:16.600
than b, b is bigger than c.

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:20.390
And you had this startling
revolutionary notion,

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:22.600
which is you now
can know something

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:25.560
about the relationship
between and a and c

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.840
without having to directly
compare them with each other.

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:33.110
This was an astonishing sort
of logical breakthrough.

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:37.050
Syllogism, syllogism
suddenly appeared in Europe

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:39.810
for the first time in
centuries, the ability

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:42.300
of people to do
things like, say,

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:46.950
if all things that
glow have fire, then

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:51.180
stars glow and thus stars have
fire, syllogistic thinking.

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:53.530
That had been utterly gone.

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:56.420
And suddenly, people
began to think

00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:00.240
about what is, where that
had been lost for centuries.

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:02.900
And all of that culminated
in a certain sort

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:06.140
of emergence of what we
would now call science.

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:09.340
Thomas Aquinas coming
up with an amazing,

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:12.340
an amazing quote, that
summarizes all of what

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:13.680
was happening at the time.

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:17.880
He listed three things
that God could not do.

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:21.440
The first two were just
sort of theological stuff.

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:22.900
God cannot sin.

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:25.100
God cannot make a
copy of himself.

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:29.400
It's the third one that
was just earth-shaking.

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:34.940
Third, even God cannot make
a triangle with more than 180

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:36.490
degrees.

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:39.730
And in that one concept,
Aquinas had just

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:43.390
said if it comes up against
sort of the old knowledge

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:46.030
and science, science wins.

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:49.270
And that was an absolutely
landmark moment.

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:52.960
God could do anything, but
still can't make a triangle

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:55.280
with more than 180 degrees.

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:59.180
This was the beginning of the
transformation of the world.

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:03.060
And this immediately had
impact, all sorts of domains,

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:05.650
not just this very
pedestrian one,

00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:08.720
which is if something
broke you could fix it.

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:13.160
That was a concept that was
very, very rare around then.

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.940
But the ability to
construct events

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:18.440
by looking at
overlapping fragments.

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:21.460
A crime has occurred
and there is

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:24.990
no individual who has watched
the entire crime happen.

00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:29.620
But one person saw what
happened from point A to C. One

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:33.039
saw from B to D. One
for all from C to--

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:36.130
and suddenly, there
was this realization

00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:39.260
that you can figure
out what went on

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.980
by putting these various
overlapping bits of data

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:46.590
together, a completely
revolutionary idea

00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:49.610
and completely transformed
the notion that how

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:53.330
do you figure out if
somebody did a crime prior

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:55.080
to this period,
what you would do

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.410
is to throw them in
the river, for example.

00:08:57.410 --> 00:08:59.720
And if they sank and
drowned, obviously they

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:00.590
had done the crime.

00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:01.740
Good luck there.

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:04.480
In terms of having figured
that out, good detective work.

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:06.500
That's how you think
figured if somebody had

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:08.140
done something wrong or not.

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:09.400
You set fire to them.

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:12.320
And if they burned, oh,
they were obviously guilty.

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:14.820
And suddenly this
concept instead,

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:21.000
not only using facts, not
only using observational data,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.890
but that you could derive
what occurred without any one

00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:27.450
individual having
seen the whole thing.

00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:31.060
You can reconstruct
things with overlapping.

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:33.430
This was just landmark.

00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:36.540
This just transformed
everything.

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:38.800
And somewhere around
this time began

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:40.550
to emerge what we
would recognize

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:43.680
to be sort of the
proto-baby steps of what

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:45.490
would be modern science.

00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:49.190
And in the aftermath of this
period came what was basically

00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:51.730
the single most
important concept

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:54.800
in all of science in
the last 500 years,

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:57.283
which is the idea
of reductionism.

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:03.100
To find, very
simply, if you want

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:07.590
to understand a complex
system, you break it down

00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:10.050
into its component parts.

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:13.710
And when you understand
the individual parts,

00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:17.750
you will be able to
understand the complex system.

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:21.660
Reductionism, this is at
the core of everything

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:25.910
that we do in science, in
modern science, centuries worth.

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:28.400
The notion that
complicated things

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:31.240
can be explained by
looking at their component

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:35.110
parts, the smaller
pieces that make them up.

00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:39.350
And what's intrinsic in that
is the concept of linearity,

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:40.990
of additivity.

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:43.360
You got something complex
and you break it down

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:44.720
into its component parts.

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:48.210
And once you figure out how
those component parts work,

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:51.690
all you need to do
is add them together

00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:57.130
and they will increase in their
complexity in a linear manner

00:10:57.130 --> 00:11:00.500
and you will produce the
whole complex system.

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:03.500
This is Westernized
reductionism.

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:05.560
And it came with a
bunch of corollaries,

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:07.480
that we take for granted by now.

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:10.560
The first one being,
in a reductive system

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:13.110
where the component parts
and how they worked,

00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:14.840
just add them together.

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:16.770
And in a straightforward
way, that

00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:18.820
will produce your
complex system.

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:21.550
One sort of
consequence of that is

00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:26.330
if you know the starting
state of a system,

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:28.780
as defined here, if you know
what the little component

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:32.180
parts all are, if you
know the starting state,

00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:34.890
you will have 100%
predictability

00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:39.520
of what the full complex
mature system will look like.

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:44.200
So starting state allows you
to predict what comes later.

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:49.160
And related to that, if you
know the complex system,

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:52.440
you can figure out what
was the starting state.

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:55.360
That there is point
for point relationship

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:58.020
between the simple
building blocks

00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:01.730
and the complex systems
that come out the other end.

00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:05.550
And this gave rise to
an extraordinary thing,

00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:09.030
which was the ability
to extrapolate,

00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:12.390
to be able to see the
answer to something

00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:16.160
in different iterations,
and to use the same rules

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:17.740
and apply them over and over.

00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:19.500
OK, what do I mean by this?

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:25.030
Suddenly this amazing notion
that, OK, if x plus y equals z,

00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:29.000
you will then know
that x plus 1 plus y

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.620
is going to equal z plus 1.

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:33.860
And x plus 2, all of that.

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:36.010
And the same exact
principle would

00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:39.150
hold for some, like, bizarre
idiot equation or whatever,

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:39.850
like that.

00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:42.150
It doesn't really matter
what all of this is.

00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:46.530
You know absolutely beforehand
simply by this business

00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:51.360
of additivity of component
parts that whatever this is,

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:54.326
it's going to equal z plus 1.

00:12:54.326 --> 00:12:57.320
You could come up with
an answer to something

00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:01.580
without having to go through
the calculations all over again.

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:04.000
You could go through
x plus whatever

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.520
and you know it's going to be
z plus whatever without having

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:09.610
to sit there and measure it.

00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:11.540
You could extrapolate.

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:15.300
You can use reductive
knowledge, the linearity,

00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:17.450
going from this to this.

00:13:17.450 --> 00:13:19.410
You're still using
the same rules.

00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:21.640
That allows you to
go from this to this.

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:25.600
Applications of it are
purely reductive linear set

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:26.440
of systems.

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:29.650
And this was revolutionary.

00:13:29.650 --> 00:13:31.290
So that's great.

00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:34.570
You don't need to go through all
the calculations at every step

00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:37.300
of the way to be able to
know the starting state

00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:39.224
and thus know what the
mature state is about.

00:13:39.224 --> 00:13:40.640
Look at the mature
state, you know

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:44.570
what the starting state was
point for point to relatedness.

00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:46.170
That's great.

00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:49.700
Finally, another feature
of reductive systems

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:55.220
like these is the really
fancy ones require blueprints.

00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:59.970
What do I mean by blueprints in
this case that requires already

00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:04.790
a notion of what the mature
state is supposed to look like?

00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:06.670
Which is intrinsic
in what I just said,

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:09.330
if you know the starting state,
you will know the mature state.

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:12.210
But the belief that in
terms of quality control,

00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:14.550
you have to have some
representation of what

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:16.750
the mature state is
supposed to look like,

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:20.230
a blueprint; in order to know
if you're doing the right thing,

00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:21.780
feedback along those lines.

00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:25.180
If you're really going to
do something hard and fancy

00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:27.170
in this reductive
world, you've got

00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:29.270
to have a road map
at the beginning.

00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:31.050
You have to have a blueprint.

00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:34.340
You have to have something
that already shows you

00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:37.170
what the outcome is going
to be when you apply

00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:39.660
these linear additive rules.

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:42.270
And the way you
go about doing it

00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:45.580
is shaped by the blueprint,
the instructions that

00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:47.765
are intrinsic in this.

00:14:47.765 --> 00:14:51.470
This is everything about
Westernized reductionism.

00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:55.640
One important additional
component to it, which is you

00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:57.840
go measure something or other.

00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:02.780
And what's the normal
temperature in humans, 98.6.

00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:04.370
There's no way you
take a whole bunch

00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:08.500
of perfectly healthy humans and
they're all going to have 98.6.

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:10.410
There is going to
be 98.6 and there

00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:12.860
will be variability around it.

00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:15.230
And you could express
that so that you wind up

00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:19.260
having an average of 98.6
and some sort of term

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.070
that denotes variability.

00:15:21.070 --> 00:15:23.230
There's variability.

00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:26.620
There's different
values for something

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:30.510
that winds up averaging
out to something like this.

00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:34.030
And thus this critical
question, in a reductive world

00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:37.850
of thinking about science and
the way fancy things work,

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:40.140
what do you make of variability?

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:42.440
What is variability about?

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:45.262
An intrinsic in this whole world
of know the starting state,

00:15:45.262 --> 00:15:47.470
you know the mature state;
you know the mature state,

00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:49.090
you knew how the
starting state was.

00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:50.820
The rules allow
you to extrapolate.

00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:52.150
It takes a blueprint.

00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:56.560
Intrinsic in there was
an absolute clear opinion

00:15:56.560 --> 00:16:01.290
as to what variability is,
which is to say it's noise.

00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:03.010
It's junk in the system.

00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:04.300
It's a pain in the rear.

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:07.100
And it's stuff you
want to get rid of.

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:11.740
What is intrinsic in this
whole reductive view is noise

00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:15.080
represents instrument
error; instrument

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:17.810
error, instrument in the
largest metaphorical sense.

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:21.990
Instrument, somebody's
observation to machinery.

00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:27.530
Variability represents
noise, represents the system

00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:30.400
you use to measure
stuff, to observe stuff

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:32.960
not working perfectly.

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:37.230
It represents something
you want to avoid.

00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:39.840
And what was also intrinsic
in that inductive view

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:46.030
is the surest way to avoid that
is to become more reductive.

00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:50.690
The notion that the closer you
look to a phenomenon, the more

00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:53.410
detail you see it
with, the more you

00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:55.660
are looking at a
more reduced level

00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:58.600
closer to the component
parts, the closer

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:02.050
you will be to seeing
what's actually going on.

00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:04.150
And as you look
closer and closer,

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:06.810
variability should disappear.

00:17:06.810 --> 00:17:10.859
Because the variability is
just noise in the system.

00:17:10.859 --> 00:17:15.170
And if you're trying to measure
people's body temperature

00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:17.010
by being up in a
Zeppelin and looking

00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:19.347
at people with your
sort of binoculars

00:17:19.347 --> 00:17:21.180
and trying to see if
they're sweating or not

00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:23.030
and come up with
an estimate then,

00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:26.300
that's going to be a lot
more variable than if you now

00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:28.310
do something more
reductive, like put

00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:29.530
your hand on their forehead.

00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:31.140
Oh, do they feel hot or not?

00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:33.450
And thus, there will
be less variability.

00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:36.530
And even less if you now
invent yourself a thermometer.

00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:41.420
This whole notion that as
you get fancier techniques

00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:45.130
for examining a phenomenon,
as you get techniques that

00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:48.120
allow you to be more
and more reductive

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:53.320
and look closer and closer,
there will be less variability.

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:56.430
Because sitting way down
at the bottom of all

00:17:56.430 --> 00:18:01.340
this reductive processes there
is an iconic, an absolute,

00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:05.790
an idealized norm as
to what the answer is.

00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:09.240
If you see anybody
not having 98.6

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:12.440
it's because there's noise
in your measurement systems.

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:14.780
Variability is noise.

00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:17.390
Variability is
something to get rid of.

00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:19.460
And the way to get
rid of variability

00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:21.960
is to become more reductive.

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:25.680
Variability is discrepancy
from seeing what

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:28.850
the actual true measure is.

00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:30.450
And that has been
a driving force

00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:32.810
essentially in all
of science in terms

00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:36.360
of the notion of inventing
new ways to look at things.

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:40.450
More powerful microscopes,
more powerful ways

00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:42.600
of measuring the levels
of something or other

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:45.270
in the bloodstream, all of
them built around the notion

00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:48.630
that the closer we look
to the component parts,

00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:51.960
the closer we will be to
seeing how the system really

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:55.410
truly works and be able
to finally see what truly

00:18:55.410 --> 00:18:57.690
is going on without the noise.

00:18:57.690 --> 00:19:00.960
Because all noise
is is discrepancy

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:03.790
from what is truly going on.

00:19:03.790 --> 00:19:06.410
So in that view, what
you, of course, wind up

00:19:06.410 --> 00:19:09.950
having is an extension of that
in beginning to think about

00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:13.610
how, like, bodies work
in biology and all that,

00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:16.540
as you begin to look at
that as an example of a very

00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:18.100
complicated system.

00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:20.390
And, of course,
what you then have

00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:24.190
in a reductionist view is
if you want to understand

00:19:24.190 --> 00:19:28.460
how the body works, you need to
understand how the organs work.

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:30.800
And if you want to
understand how organs work,

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:33.000
you need to understand
how cells work,

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.170
and cells all the way
down to molecules,

00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:36.540
all the way down there.

00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:39.190
And the notion that the
closer you get to all the way

00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:42.590
down there, and once you
understand things down

00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:45.480
at that level, the
purer, the more accurate

00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:46.940
your answers will be.

00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:50.090
And all you do then is add
the pieces together and out

00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:52.480
comes your whole body.

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:55.990
So where does that
begin to cause problems?

00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:58.210
The fact that the
body simply can't

00:19:58.210 --> 00:20:02.470
work that way, a whole bunch
of realms in which reductionism

00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:07.270
has to fail when you're
looking at biological systems.

00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:10.030
One example of this,
the first one, and this

00:20:10.030 --> 00:20:12.560
is immediately jumping
into neurobiology,

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:16.680
this was classic work, work done
by these two neurobiologists.

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:19.250
Anyone who was in
BioCore sort of

00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:22.040
went through me haranguing
about how great these guys were,

00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:24.530
a pair of neuroscientists,
Hubel and Wiesel,

00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:26.570
absolute giants in the field.

00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:30.030
In the 1950s, up to
the 1960s, everybody

00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:34.120
thought that they had discovered
exactly how the cortex worked.

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:38.560
And what they found was a
phenomenally clean reductive

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:41.990
world of how you
extracted information

00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:44.370
from the visual
world around you.

00:20:44.370 --> 00:20:47.290
I will spare you the details
because it's not important.

00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:49.520
But what they
basically showed was

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:55.490
you could find individual cells
in the retina that corresponded

00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:58.280
to individual neurons
in the simplest

00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:00.880
part of the visual cortex.

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:04.910
And between them, you had
simple point for point reductive

00:21:04.910 --> 00:21:05.910
relationships.

00:21:05.910 --> 00:21:09.140
If you stimulated
this one retinal cell,

00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:12.180
it's associated neuron in
this part of the cortex

00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:14.960
would get excited and
have an action potential.

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:17.770
If you shift your
electrode over a smidgen

00:21:17.770 --> 00:21:20.000
and stimulate the
one right next to it,

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.620
the neuron right next to this
one is going to get stimulated.

00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:28.040
In other words, if you know
the starting state, which

00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:30.500
receptors in the eye
have been stimulated,

00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:34.420
you have 100% predictability
of which neurons appear,

00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:35.580
are going to fire.

00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:37.550
And the converse, know
which ones fired here.

00:21:37.550 --> 00:21:39.680
And you have
complete information

00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:41.750
about the starting state.

00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:44.830
And what they did was
begin to build on that.

00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:48.970
They showed that insofar as
that first layer of the cortex

00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:52.040
had this one to one
correspondence with one cell

00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:55.940
here to one cell there, what
did individual neurons know

00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:59.120
about in this simple part
of the visual cortex?

00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:02.260
These neurons knew
how to recognize dots.

00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:05.130
Each neuron could
recognize a dot

00:22:05.130 --> 00:22:09.190
and one dot only and was the
only neuron that recognized it.

00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:11.830
This was a point for
point reductive system.

00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:15.960
And take all those individual
little neuron component parts,

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:18.680
each of which then knew
something about one dot,

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:20.350
and put them together
and you could

00:22:20.350 --> 00:22:24.920
begin to get some information
about what just hit the eye.

00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:28.920
What they then showed was
the next layer of the cortex.

00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:31.840
And again to simplify
things as much as possible,

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:34.890
what they began to
see was you would now

00:22:34.890 --> 00:22:37.970
stimulate one of
those retinal cells

00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:41.170
and one neuron in the
first layer of cortex

00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:42.260
would get excited.

00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:44.380
Nothing would happen
in the second layer.

00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:47.270
Shift over, stimulate
the next one over,

00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:50.180
the next one over, nothing in
the next part of the cortex,

00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:52.680
over and over and over,
over and over and over,

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:56.680
and then suddenly one of the
neurons in the second cortex

00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:57.810
gets excited.

00:22:57.810 --> 00:23:02.292
If and only if you first
stimulate this photoreceptor,

00:23:02.292 --> 00:23:04.500
followed by this, followed
by this, followed by this,

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:05.300
followed by this.

00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:08.970
What does that neuron
know about, light moving

00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:11.790
in a straight line
in this direction.

00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:16.420
That part of the cortex
could extract the information

00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:20.500
from that first layer and
put them together and get

00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:22.100
different sorts of information.

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:24.960
And, thus, you would
have another neuron there

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:29.014
that would code for an angle
that was slightly different,

00:23:29.014 --> 00:23:29.930
and another one there.

00:23:29.930 --> 00:23:31.510
And then ones for
different parts

00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:34.612
of the cortex, different
parts of the visual system,

00:23:34.612 --> 00:23:37.587
and very long lines or
very slow moving lights

00:23:37.587 --> 00:23:38.420
or things like that.

00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:41.790
What do neurons in that
second layer know about?

00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:44.680
They know how to
recognize straight lines.

00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:48.150
And you could see again,
this is a reductive system.

00:23:48.150 --> 00:23:51.640
Because you know the wiring
that goes from one layer,

00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:53.760
from the eye, to this
layer, to this layer.

00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:57.270
And thus, if you know
what's going on here,

00:23:57.270 --> 00:23:59.700
you can work backwards and
know what's happening there

00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:01.090
and what's happening
in the eye and the same

00:24:01.090 --> 00:24:02.240
with the other direction.

00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:04.350
A point for point
system, where now you're

00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:08.860
beginning to extract a higher
level, a hierarchy of analysis,

00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:11.640
but the same exact reductionism.

00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:15.030
And just to then begin to show
what they then went on to,

00:24:15.030 --> 00:24:17.620
again this is very
simplified, now

00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:19.620
you begin to get neurons here.

00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:22.180
One of them will
respond to this line.

00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:24.260
Another will respond
to this line.

00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:26.090
Another will respond
to this line.

00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:29.250
If and only if
these three neurons

00:24:29.250 --> 00:24:32.420
are firing
simultaneously, one neuron

00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:35.680
in the next layer of the
visual cortex would fire.

00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:37.870
What do neurons
there know about?

00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:41.610
Each one knows about a
curve and one curve only.

00:24:41.610 --> 00:24:44.550
The same exact
thing again, which

00:24:44.550 --> 00:24:47.030
is point for point reductionism.

00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:49.280
If you want to
understand the system,

00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:52.550
you need to understand how
every single neuron is wired

00:24:52.550 --> 00:24:54.200
to every next one in line.

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:57.090
And once you got that,
all you need to know

00:24:57.090 --> 00:24:59.640
is what information,
what activity,

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:01.290
is happening at any level.

00:25:01.290 --> 00:25:04.490
And you've got 100% knowledge
of what will be going on here,

00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:08.760
and here, and here, a
purely reductive system.

00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:09.740
Everybody loved this.

00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:12.810
This was the greatest stuff
that happened in neurobiology.

00:25:12.810 --> 00:25:15.990
This was arguably the most
important work in neurobiology

00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:18.760
between, like, 1950, 1975.

00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:20.720
The two of them got
their Nobel Prize.

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:23.020
People would have given them
a dozen if they could of.

00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:25.180
Because what had
they just solved,

00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:30.450
they just showed how the brain
processes sensory information,

00:25:30.450 --> 00:25:33.740
how it extracts information
from the world around

00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:37.710
and turns it into complex
bits of sensory information.

00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:40.380
Because it was completely
obvious at this point what

00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:42.880
was going to happen,
which was above this,

00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:45.380
there would be a
layer that had neurons

00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:47.660
that could respond to a
certain number of curves

00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:48.930
simultaneously.

00:25:48.930 --> 00:25:51.240
It can start seeing
three dimensions.

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:53.690
And then above that is one
where the three dimensions

00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:54.840
are changing over time.

00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:57.220
It can detect movement of
a three-dimensional object.

00:25:57.220 --> 00:25:59.550
And the notion was you
would be able to just go

00:25:59.550 --> 00:26:03.560
up a layer after layer of
reductive pointilist wiring

00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:07.810
and way up on top, you would
have this super-duper layer

00:26:07.810 --> 00:26:10.080
of visual cortical processing.

00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:12.630
And all the way up on
top, somewhere up there,

00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:15.630
you would now have a neuron that
knew one thing and one thing

00:26:15.630 --> 00:26:18.740
only, knew how to recognize
your grandmother's face

00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:20.720
at this angle.

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:23.270
And the notion would be
that right next to it

00:26:23.270 --> 00:26:25.600
was another neuron that
recognized your grandmother's

00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:27.990
face at this angle,
and then one like this.

00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:29.850
And right behind, with
the rows of neurons

00:26:29.850 --> 00:26:31.580
recognizing your grandfather.

00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:34.520
And everybody
decided this is it.

00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:36.870
Just take this world
of Hubel and Wiesel's

00:26:36.870 --> 00:26:40.900
stepwise extraction of
information and keep going.

00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:45.360
And that's how the brain
winds up recognizing faces.

00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:47.230
And meanwhile,
people subsequently

00:26:47.230 --> 00:26:52.060
showed in the auditory cortex
that the correspondence

00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:54.800
between one cochlear
cell, one hair cell there,

00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:59.350
recognizing a single note,
up to chords, up to OK.

00:26:59.350 --> 00:27:01.200
So now you go up
enough layers there

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:03.980
and you will find a layer
that your single neurons then

00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:06.830
know your grandmother's
favorite symphony.

00:27:06.830 --> 00:27:07.890
And that's it.

00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:09.830
All the way up, you
would eventually

00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:13.120
find neurons that were
specialized in really

00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:15.400
complex sensory information.

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:17.480
And all you had to
do was just keep

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:20.790
going like this in this
purely reductive way

00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:22.910
and you've got it
up there on top.

00:27:22.910 --> 00:27:25.010
And people at the
time actually did

00:27:25.010 --> 00:27:27.930
refer to these as
grandmother neurons.

00:27:27.930 --> 00:27:30.630
The notion that
enough layers up here,

00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:33.990
you would get neurons
that responded to a really

00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:36.470
complex thing and only to that.

00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:39.110
And it was the only neuron
that responded to that point

00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:41.190
for point, one thing
and one thing only.

00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:43.760
And that all you needed to
do was just keep doing this

00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:45.760
and you would eventually
get neurons that

00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:48.100
recognized your grandmother.

00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:50.270
So right around the time
that Hubel and Wiesel got

00:27:50.270 --> 00:27:53.440
their third layer here, and
this took them about 15 years,

00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:55.520
they decided to go
study something else

00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:56.989
in the visual system.

00:27:56.989 --> 00:27:59.030
And that turned out to be
at least as interesting

00:27:59.030 --> 00:27:59.980
as this stuff.

00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:02.196
But everybody else
leapt in at that point,

00:28:02.196 --> 00:28:04.070
to try to find the next
layer, and the layer,

00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:05.080
and the next layer.

00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:07.440
And Hubel and Wiesel had
shown a remarkable bit

00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:09.670
of wisdom or
intuition by bailing

00:28:09.670 --> 00:28:11.210
on the field at that point.

00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:14.290
Because to this
day, hardly anybody

00:28:14.290 --> 00:28:18.200
has ever shown the existence
of a grandmother neuron

00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:20.000
all the way down there.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.260
They simply don't exist.

00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:24.000
OK, that's a lie.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:24.960
They do exist.

00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:26.960
But there's very few of them.

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:28.530
There's sparse coding.

00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:32.050
Occasionally, you find
neurons that show grandmother

00:28:32.050 --> 00:28:35.230
neuron-like processes,
neurons, a single neuron that

00:28:35.230 --> 00:28:38.580
will respond to a face
and only one type of face,

00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:42.130
way up there in many layers
of visual cortical processing.

00:28:42.130 --> 00:28:43.820
There are some of those.

00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:45.890
And there was a paper in
Nature some years ago,

00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:49.450
which was one of the weirdest
papers I have ever seen.

00:28:49.450 --> 00:28:51.510
Really interesting in
terms of what it showed,

00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:53.860
but weird from the
standpoint of what

00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:56.750
were these folks thinking
to actually test this?

00:28:56.750 --> 00:28:59.070
And they were recording
from the very upper layers

00:28:59.070 --> 00:29:01.550
of visual cortex
in monkey brains.

00:29:01.550 --> 00:29:04.060
And they found some
neurons that responded.

00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:08.450
One neuron would respond
only to a certain human face,

00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:11.100
encoding a
grandmother-type neuron.

00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:13.130
Here's the bizarre
thing in that paper.

00:29:13.130 --> 00:29:15.370
What they discovered
were neurons

00:29:15.370 --> 00:29:17.580
in the brains of
these rhesus monkeys,

00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:21.730
where there would be a single
grandmotheresque neuron.

00:29:21.730 --> 00:29:23.363
And what they found
was a neuron that

00:29:23.363 --> 00:29:27.270
would respond to a picture
of Jennifer Aniston.

00:29:27.270 --> 00:29:29.130
You think I'm being sarcastic.

00:29:29.130 --> 00:29:31.690
They found a Jennifer
Aniston neuron,

00:29:31.690 --> 00:29:34.500
which would respond
to a photograph of her

00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:37.220
at all sorts of different
angles, a caricature, all

00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:37.840
of that.

00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:40.810
They went and showed the
grandmother specificity of this

00:29:40.810 --> 00:29:43.440
by showing that-- and this
is in the paper-- it did not

00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:45.790
respond to Julia Roberts.

00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:48.100
It did not respond to Brad Pitt.

00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:49.750
Brad's very
meaningfully with that.

00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:52.430
It did not respond to
Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt

00:29:52.430 --> 00:29:53.540
in the same picture.

00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:57.350
And God knows what was going on
with Angelina Jolie with that.

00:29:57.350 --> 00:29:58.990
OK, that shows
how bizarre it is.

00:29:58.990 --> 00:30:00.730
The one other thing
they discovered

00:30:00.730 --> 00:30:04.060
this neuron would respond to was
a picture of the Sydney Opera

00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:05.870
House.

00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:07.010
What's up with that?

00:30:07.010 --> 00:30:11.610
So this is, to knowledge, almost
a perfect reductive grandmother

00:30:11.610 --> 00:30:12.300
neuron.

00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:16.190
The bizarre thing being, what
made these guys figure, I know,

00:30:16.190 --> 00:30:17.940
let's go get a picture
of Jennifer Aniston

00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:20.950
and show it to the rhesus
monkey and see what happens?

00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:22.160
Where did that come from?

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:24.040
I recall, there
was not a whole lot

00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:26.600
of illuminating information
in the methods section

00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:29.250
as to where those sort
of pictures came from.

00:30:29.250 --> 00:30:31.462
But, so there are some these.

00:30:31.462 --> 00:30:34.950
Some of them do exist, cases
of what people in the field

00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:38.730
call sparse coding, where
you only need a few neurons

00:30:38.730 --> 00:30:43.460
to recognize some really fancy
things, like Jennifer Aniston.

00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:47.590
Nonetheless, the vast, vast
majority of the attempts

00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:51.080
to find grandmother
neurons failed dismally,

00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:53.730
for a very simple reason.

00:30:53.730 --> 00:30:54.400
OK.

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:57.715
How many neurons do you need
where each one knows one dot

00:30:57.715 --> 00:30:59.280
and one dot only?

00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:01.890
You need the exact
same number of neurons

00:31:01.890 --> 00:31:05.460
as the number of
photoreceptors in your retina.

00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:08.050
How many neurons do
you need in this layer

00:31:08.050 --> 00:31:09.920
that turns these into lines?

00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:12.560
Well, you need one
that's going to respond

00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:14.570
to a line of this
length, and then one that

00:31:14.570 --> 00:31:16.200
will respond to this length,
and one of this length,

00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:17.950
and one of that length,
and the one that's

00:31:17.950 --> 00:31:19.580
a slightly different angle.

00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:23.980
You need, like, 10 times more
neurons in this layer than this

00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:26.410
to be able to pull
off that processing.

00:31:26.410 --> 00:31:28.740
How many neurons do
you need in this layer?

00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:31.610
Like, tenfold, 100-fold
more than here.

00:31:31.610 --> 00:31:34.740
And how come you don't
even have the next layer,

00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:37.450
let alone the grandmother
neurons in these three numbers

00:31:37.450 --> 00:31:39.850
because you run out of neurons.

00:31:39.850 --> 00:31:42.930
There's not enough neurons
in the brain, let alone

00:31:42.930 --> 00:31:46.400
the visual cortex, to
process stuff that way.

00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:49.150
You can't have a
layer above that

00:31:49.150 --> 00:31:51.680
because you've run
out of neurons.

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:56.050
In other words, there's not
enough neurons in the brain

00:31:56.050 --> 00:31:59.530
to do face recognition in
a point for point reductive

00:31:59.530 --> 00:32:00.830
manner.

00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:03.790
The system breaks
down because of lack

00:32:03.790 --> 00:32:06.001
of enough numbers of things.

00:32:06.001 --> 00:32:07.500
And what people
have been doing ever

00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:10.420
since then, what's become
the dominant sort of approach

00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:14.770
in that field, is an explicitly
non-reductive approach, which

00:32:14.770 --> 00:32:18.130
is now looking at something
called neural networks.

00:32:18.130 --> 00:32:21.229
Information, the really
fancy complex information,

00:32:21.229 --> 00:32:22.770
like what everybody
else from Friends

00:32:22.770 --> 00:32:25.030
looked like, except
for the Aniston neuron.

00:32:25.030 --> 00:32:27.650
Really complex
information is not

00:32:27.650 --> 00:32:31.610
coded for in a single
protein, a single synapse,

00:32:31.610 --> 00:32:32.900
a single neuron.

00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:37.150
It's coded for in patterns,
in patterns of activation

00:32:37.150 --> 00:32:39.590
across hundreds,
thousands of neurons,

00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:41.990
networks that are interacting.

00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:46.260
So you have a complete crashing
and burning of what up to here

00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:49.440
seemed like the greatest
demonstration of point

00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:52.870
for point reductive processing
of sensory information, which

00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:55.450
just led you all the way
up to grandmother neurons.

00:32:55.450 --> 00:32:58.100
And they basically don't
exist because you run out

00:32:58.100 --> 00:32:59.820
of neurons at this point.

00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:03.490
You can't solve the problem
of recognizing faces

00:33:03.490 --> 00:33:07.490
by using reductive
component partner biology.

00:33:07.490 --> 00:33:10.870
The next domain where
it falls apart as well.

00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:12.410
OK, what do we have here?

00:33:12.410 --> 00:33:15.960
Either we've got
a canal on Mars,

00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:20.030
or we've got a frost patten on
a window, or we've got a tree,

00:33:20.030 --> 00:33:23.880
or we've got a pattern of, like,
long branching of some sort.

00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:25.190
What do we have?

00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:27.750
We have a bifurcating system.

00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:30.930
And the characteristic
of a bifurcating system

00:33:30.930 --> 00:33:34.160
is it is scale-free.

00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:39.220
On a certain level, if this is
what the drainage line looks--

00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:43.170
you know, the Nile emptying out
into sort of the Mediterranean

00:33:43.170 --> 00:33:44.820
as seen by a satellite.

00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:49.530
And if you're looking
at the dendrites

00:33:49.530 --> 00:33:53.820
on one single neuron with
an appropriate microscope,

00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:57.220
if you look at it formally in
terms of the branching pattern,

00:33:57.220 --> 00:34:00.240
you can't tell which
one you are looking at.

00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:03.425
The complexity of the
branching is scale-free.

00:34:06.540 --> 00:34:09.010
So it turns out some of
the most important things

00:34:09.010 --> 00:34:13.480
we have in our bodies
are bifurcating systems.

00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:16.810
All the branch points on
neurons are bifurcating.

00:34:16.810 --> 00:34:19.929
And maybe what we'll post
is some amazing pictures

00:34:19.929 --> 00:34:22.690
of bifurcating dendritic
trees of neurons.

00:34:22.690 --> 00:34:25.650
And they're called
dendritic trees

00:34:25.650 --> 00:34:28.120
because they look
just like trees.

00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:30.909
And when they get more
complex for some reason,

00:34:30.909 --> 00:34:35.380
you are said to have increased
their arborization, using terms

00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:40.080
straight out of treeology, so
neuronal complexity in terms

00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:41.460
of its branch points.

00:34:41.460 --> 00:34:45.050
Look at the circulatory
system and it's the same thing

00:34:45.050 --> 00:34:46.889
as a bifurcating system.

00:34:46.889 --> 00:34:51.290
You've got your descending
aorta, which is ascending here.

00:34:51.290 --> 00:34:54.489
And then it splits into
two, and splits into two,

00:34:54.489 --> 00:34:57.210
and splits in-- and
it a tree, bifurcating

00:34:57.210 --> 00:35:00.370
into a whole bunch of little
capillaries at the end.

00:35:00.370 --> 00:35:02.990
You look at the
pulmonary system and it

00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:06.180
is the exact same
bifurcation, coming down

00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:10.340
your trachea, which
splits into two bronchos,

00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:13.200
and then splits into
branchioles or whatever.

00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:15.270
And it's the same exact thing.

00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:18.580
So you've got this theme
of bifurcating systems

00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:21.130
throughout living
systems in the body.

00:35:21.130 --> 00:35:23.550
And notice the
difference in scale.

00:35:23.550 --> 00:35:27.200
If this is the blood vessels,
we are talking about millions

00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:29.810
of cells making up the
blood vessel walls.

00:35:29.810 --> 00:35:31.690
But here, we are
seeing potentially

00:35:31.690 --> 00:35:34.410
the exact same
complexity of branching

00:35:34.410 --> 00:35:39.390
in a neuron that's a single
cell, independent of scale.

00:35:39.390 --> 00:35:42.230
And you can have just as
complex branching coming off

00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:44.960
of a single neuron as the
branching you're getting

00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:47.640
in a gazillion
different capillaries

00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:50.080
in the tree of
projections it comes from,

00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:53.570
the same exact
degree of complexity.

00:35:53.570 --> 00:35:55.900
So now we come to
the problem here,

00:35:55.900 --> 00:35:59.770
which is so how does
the body code for that?

00:35:59.770 --> 00:36:02.500
How does the body give
out the instructions

00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:06.640
as to how to make a
bifurcating system?

00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:09.750
And this is where you
immediately run into trouble.

00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:11.830
What's a world we're
sort of oriented to?

00:36:11.830 --> 00:36:14.490
In a purely reductive
world, there

00:36:14.490 --> 00:36:21.170
is some sort of set of rules
telling an aorta, that's

00:36:21.170 --> 00:36:25.690
growing like this, that there
is some gene or genes which

00:36:25.690 --> 00:36:29.130
specify the point
where this bifurcates.

00:36:29.130 --> 00:36:31.820
And this bifurcates
and it's two inches

00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:33.370
in diameter or something.

00:36:33.370 --> 00:36:35.450
Meanwhile, at a
later point, where

00:36:35.450 --> 00:36:38.950
it's about an inch in
diameter, it bifurcates.

00:36:38.950 --> 00:36:40.830
It's a different
gene or set of genes

00:36:40.830 --> 00:36:45.480
that specifies this bifurcation
and another type of gene that

00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:46.870
specifies the next one.

00:36:46.870 --> 00:36:49.870
And those are obviously going
to be totally different sorts

00:36:49.870 --> 00:36:52.540
of genes than specifying
the same branching

00:36:52.540 --> 00:36:53.870
patterns of the neuron.

00:36:53.870 --> 00:36:55.300
This is one cell.

00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:58.440
Here, you're having to
specify thousands of cells

00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:01.180
and at what point do they
stop adhering in a certain way

00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:03.070
so you can make a split there.

00:37:03.070 --> 00:37:05.370
And you look at this
and suddenly you've

00:37:05.370 --> 00:37:11.190
got the same problem,
which is there's not

00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:14.810
enough genes in the
genome that exist

00:37:14.810 --> 00:37:17.590
to be able to code this way.

00:37:17.590 --> 00:37:20.900
You can't code for
bifurcating systems

00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:25.800
in a living organism that covers
completely different scales.

00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:27.980
From one cell up to
zillions of cells,

00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:32.860
you can't code for it in a point
for point reductive way, where

00:37:32.860 --> 00:37:35.370
the points down at the
bottom, the component parts,

00:37:35.370 --> 00:37:37.190
are individual genes.

00:37:37.190 --> 00:37:39.900
You can't code for
recognizing your grandmother

00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:43.360
with simple reductive
component parts of neurons.

00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:46.760
You can't code for the
bifurcating systems in the body

00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:50.720
because these will bifurcate
out to millions of capillaries

00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:53.120
and there's only 20,000 genes.

00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:57.070
The reductive approach
breaks down here as well.

00:37:57.070 --> 00:37:59.920
Reductive point for
point approaches

00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:02.010
break down when you
get to the cortex,

00:38:02.010 --> 00:38:05.530
trying to do something fancy,
like recognizing faces, instead

00:38:05.530 --> 00:38:06.390
of dots.

00:38:06.390 --> 00:38:09.830
And it breaks down when you
look at bifurcating systems that

00:38:09.830 --> 00:38:13.700
have to have a plan to split,
and then split, and then split

00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:17.220
a million times to get all
the capillaries out there.

00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:20.660
You can't code for it
with a reductive approach.

00:38:20.660 --> 00:38:24.540
If there's not enough neurons,
there's not enough genes.

00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:28.170
The next way in which
reductionism fails,

00:38:28.170 --> 00:38:30.635
and the notion that if you
know the starting state,

00:38:30.635 --> 00:38:33.010
you'll know the complex version
and the other way around,

00:38:33.010 --> 00:38:35.100
all of that, and we've
already gotten this.

00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:38.380
We got this back when, in the
molecular genetics lectures,

00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:42.040
which is the role of
chance in these systems.

00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:47.310
All of that stuff we heard
about, about sort of molecules

00:38:47.310 --> 00:38:49.840
vibrating, Brownian motion.

00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:53.310
And what that winds up
doing is when cells split,

00:38:53.310 --> 00:38:56.960
it's going to be unequal
distributions of mitochondria.

00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:58.660
It's going to be things of that.

00:38:58.660 --> 00:39:01.870
Sheer chance is
going to throw off

00:39:01.870 --> 00:39:04.830
your ability to deal with
a reductive point for point

00:39:04.830 --> 00:39:05.460
system.

00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:09.780
You take identical
twins and they're

00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:13.920
each at the, like,
fertilized egg stage.

00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:17.260
And what you know in
a reductive world is

00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:19.760
when it splits in
two in this twin,

00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:23.560
and splits in two in
this twin, this cell

00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:26.140
is going to be identical
to this one, this one

00:39:26.140 --> 00:39:29.960
identical with this, all the
way down to single molecules

00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:32.360
because this is a
reductive world in terms

00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:33.330
of how they split.

00:39:33.330 --> 00:39:36.350
And what we know is by
the time a cell splits

00:39:36.350 --> 00:39:38.530
for the first
time, this split is

00:39:38.530 --> 00:39:40.360
going to distribute
the mitochondria

00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:43.410
between these two
differently than distributed

00:39:43.410 --> 00:39:44.620
between these two.

00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:48.620
Even at the first
cell division, chance

00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:52.610
is throwing off this ability
to know the starting state

00:39:52.610 --> 00:39:55.580
and know what the complex
system is going to be.

00:39:55.580 --> 00:39:58.830
So reductionism breaks down
there as well, the fact

00:39:58.830 --> 00:40:02.110
that chance plays a role
in any of these systems.

00:40:02.110 --> 00:40:06.160
The mitochondria wind
up dividing unequally,

00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:08.210
the transcription factors.

00:40:08.210 --> 00:40:10.850
You remember all that
stuff from there.

00:40:10.850 --> 00:40:13.730
The same exact thing
with transposons,

00:40:13.730 --> 00:40:15.650
with genes jumping around.

00:40:15.650 --> 00:40:18.990
You throw in that
randomizing chance element

00:40:18.990 --> 00:40:20.530
into there as well.

00:40:20.530 --> 00:40:23.450
You can't take the
starting states

00:40:23.450 --> 00:40:25.580
and wind up building on it.

00:40:25.580 --> 00:40:27.640
An example in
behavior, a guy named

00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:30.190
Ivan Chase did this really
interesting research

00:40:30.190 --> 00:40:33.600
with dominance behaviors,
the emergence of dominance

00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:34.930
in different species.

00:40:34.930 --> 00:40:35.510
OK.

00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:38.700
So you are going to have a
colony of, like, 10 fish.

00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:41.300
And what you do initially
is each one of them

00:40:41.300 --> 00:40:42.790
is in a tank of their own.

00:40:42.790 --> 00:40:45.720
And you set up a
round-robin tournament.

00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:47.840
You get every possible
pairing of fish.

00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:49.240
You put them against each other.

00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:52.850
And you see which one is
dominant of that pair.

00:40:52.850 --> 00:40:54.400
So you've done all of that.

00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:57.650
And you were able to derive
a dominance hierarchy, where

00:40:57.650 --> 00:41:00.560
the number one fish is
the one that dominated all

00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:03.310
the other nine in those
dyadic interactions.

00:41:03.310 --> 00:41:05.990
Number two dominated
eight of them, so on.

00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:09.930
It is simply a process,
a syllogistic expansion,

00:41:09.930 --> 00:41:12.790
to be able to then generate
a dominance hierarchy;

00:41:12.790 --> 00:41:16.700
pure, I know the starting
state, every single dyad

00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:18.520
and what the outcome was.

00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:20.620
I can now predict what
the dominance hierarchy

00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:23.880
is going to be when you
put all the fish together.

00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:26.740
And what he sees, of
course, is once you actually

00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:29.070
get the fish together
in a social group,

00:41:29.070 --> 00:41:31.940
there is no
resemblance whatsoever.

00:41:31.940 --> 00:41:35.170
The dyadic pairing
dominance outcomes

00:41:35.170 --> 00:41:38.830
has zero predictability over
what the actual dominance

00:41:38.830 --> 00:41:41.060
hierarchy is going to be like.

00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:42.540
Why should that be?

00:41:42.540 --> 00:41:45.830
Because chance plays
a role as well.

00:41:45.830 --> 00:41:48.950
You are fish and you've learned
this transitivity stuff,

00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:52.420
as fish are able to do, at least
in Professor Fernald's lab.

00:41:52.420 --> 00:41:57.290
And they're able to
do, if he defeats him

00:41:57.290 --> 00:42:00.040
and he defeats me, I
better give that guy

00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:01.970
a subordinating gesture.

00:42:01.970 --> 00:42:04.610
We've now just fit together
two of those pieces,

00:42:04.610 --> 00:42:06.750
establishing the
dyad beforehand.

00:42:06.750 --> 00:42:10.760
But what if the guy happens
to be facing the other way

00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:13.940
and doesn't see
him dominating him?

00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:15.650
And you've just lost the chance.

00:42:15.650 --> 00:42:19.410
Chance interactions wind
up driving the system.

00:42:19.410 --> 00:42:22.720
Random movement of the animals
and such winds up meaning

00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:25.100
knowing the starting
states of the dominance

00:42:25.100 --> 00:42:27.630
relations of every
single dyad gives you

00:42:27.630 --> 00:42:31.090
zero predictability of
what the complex system is

00:42:31.090 --> 00:42:33.180
going to look like.

00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:34.820
So what we have
over and over here

00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:37.990
is, amid this wonderful
Westernized focus

00:42:37.990 --> 00:42:40.090
on reductionism--
and this is going

00:42:40.090 --> 00:42:43.240
to tell us exactly how
complex systems work,

00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:45.030
and the starting
state, and the form,

00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:48.850
we're seeing here over and
over in biological systems,

00:42:48.850 --> 00:42:53.520
ranging from behavior of entire
organisms, down to genes,

00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:58.010
reductive systems break down
because there's simply not

00:42:58.010 --> 00:43:01.120
enough pieces in
there to explain

00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:05.420
complex function in a point for
point reductive component part,

00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:08.550
broken down, add them up
together afterward way.

00:43:08.550 --> 00:43:11.560
And there's no way
to deal with the fact

00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:15.710
that chance plays a role
in biological systems.

00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:17.660
So what have we
just gotten to here?

00:43:17.660 --> 00:43:20.750
500 years or so into
this reductive program,

00:43:20.750 --> 00:43:25.520
what we're seeing is if you kind
of are interested in behavior,

00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:27.760
or the brain, or any of
that stuff, what you've just

00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:31.590
discovered is the most
interesting domains

00:43:31.590 --> 00:43:35.170
of brain function, of
genetic regulation,

00:43:35.170 --> 00:43:38.670
the most interesting
stuff can't be regulated

00:43:38.670 --> 00:43:41.140
in a classical reductive way.

00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:42.980
It breaks down there.

00:43:42.980 --> 00:43:44.620
It can't be that way.

00:43:44.620 --> 00:43:46.820
It's got to be something else.

00:43:46.820 --> 00:43:49.240
So what this will do
now is transition us

00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:53.320
into this whole issue
of chaotic systems.

00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:57.800
What happens when you have a
system that is not reductive,

00:43:57.800 --> 00:44:01.550
where there is
non-linear nonadditivity,

00:44:01.550 --> 00:44:04.590
where you suddenly have
a very different picture?

00:44:04.590 --> 00:44:08.040
If a clock is broken,
you take the pieces apart

00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:11.460
and you find the one tooth or
one gear there that's missing

00:44:11.460 --> 00:44:12.590
and you fix that.

00:44:12.590 --> 00:44:15.280
And you now are able to put
the pieces back together

00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:18.690
in an additive way and you
will have fixed the clock.

00:44:18.690 --> 00:44:21.640
A clock can be fixed
using reductive point

00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:23.390
for point knowledge.

00:44:23.390 --> 00:44:25.580
Now, you have a problem
with something else.

00:44:25.580 --> 00:44:30.080
You have a cloud that doesn't
rain enough during a drought.

00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:32.230
How are you going to
figure out what's wrong?

00:44:32.230 --> 00:44:32.910
I know.

00:44:32.910 --> 00:44:35.730
Let's divide the
cloud in half and then

00:44:35.730 --> 00:44:38.560
get better tools so we can
divide each half into half,

00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:39.650
and each half into half.

00:44:39.650 --> 00:44:44.210
And eventually, we'll get like
one molecule worth of cloud

00:44:44.210 --> 00:44:45.256
and a gazillion of them.

00:44:45.256 --> 00:44:47.130
And we understand how
each one of them works.

00:44:47.130 --> 00:44:48.630
And put them together
and then we'll

00:44:48.630 --> 00:44:50.680
understand why
there's a drought.

00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:52.550
It doesn't work that way.

00:44:52.550 --> 00:44:56.260
Reductive approaches can
be used to fix clocks.

00:44:56.260 --> 00:44:59.250
Reductive approaches can't
be used to understand

00:44:59.250 --> 00:45:01.160
why clouds don't rain.

00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:04.100
And the whole point of all
chaos in these lectures

00:45:04.100 --> 00:45:07.560
here is when you look at the
interesting complex biological

00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:09.600
systems, they're clouds.

00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:10.920
They're not clocks.

00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:14.050
You need a whole different
explanatory system.

00:45:14.050 --> 00:45:15.690
So let's take a
five-minute break.

00:45:15.690 --> 00:45:17.850
And we will transition
to beginning

00:45:17.850 --> 00:45:22.330
to look at what chaoticism
is about, about this science.

00:45:22.330 --> 00:45:24.410
Showing that
Westernized reductionism

00:45:24.410 --> 00:45:28.660
is really good for fairly
uncomplicated systems

00:45:28.660 --> 00:45:30.380
breaking down in
component parts.

00:45:30.380 --> 00:45:33.290
The whole world of this
stuff we find interesting,

00:45:33.290 --> 00:45:36.730
it can't work because there's
not enough component parts.

00:45:36.730 --> 00:45:39.010
There's not a blueprint
that has enough elements

00:45:39.010 --> 00:45:41.820
in it and because of
the role of chance.

00:45:41.820 --> 00:45:44.190
And what this
transitions us into

00:45:44.190 --> 00:45:49.350
are non-linear systems,
nonadditive systems,

00:45:49.350 --> 00:45:52.810
where you break something
down to its component parts,

00:45:52.810 --> 00:45:55.080
and you study all these
pieces, and you put it

00:45:55.080 --> 00:45:58.040
back together again, and
it's going to be different.

00:45:58.040 --> 00:45:59.850
They've added up differently.

00:45:59.850 --> 00:46:02.730
You understand the starting
point in the system

00:46:02.730 --> 00:46:05.560
and you are going to have
no predictability about what

00:46:05.560 --> 00:46:09.810
the complex form is about
because the pieces don't add up

00:46:09.810 --> 00:46:12.540
in a straight linear manner.

00:46:12.540 --> 00:46:13.390
OK.

00:46:13.390 --> 00:46:14.830
What do I mean by this?

00:46:14.830 --> 00:46:19.410
As we begin to approach
this, what is chaotism about?

00:46:19.410 --> 00:46:21.020
Here, we have a
distinctive thing.

00:46:21.020 --> 00:46:25.000
We have a difference between two
different ways in which things

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.030
can be deterministic.

00:46:27.030 --> 00:46:33.450
Here's a-- no.

00:46:33.450 --> 00:46:35.265
You're just coming up
with a number series.

00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:40.340
And there's a rule.

00:46:40.340 --> 00:46:42.420
There's a rule which
determines what

00:46:42.420 --> 00:46:44.970
the next number is going to
be in the sequence, which

00:46:44.970 --> 00:46:47.000
is just add 1.

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:50.300
This is a determinist system.

00:46:50.300 --> 00:46:56.180
It is a periodic one, in
that knowing what the rule is

00:46:56.180 --> 00:46:58.590
and knowing which
point you're at,

00:46:58.590 --> 00:47:00.690
someone could say
what's it going

00:47:00.690 --> 00:47:03.980
to be in 15 steps
down the line there?

00:47:03.980 --> 00:47:07.210
And you don't need to say, well,
number one is going to be 5,

00:47:07.210 --> 00:47:09.040
number two is going
to be 6, number-- you

00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:10.460
don't need to do that.

00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:12.930
You've recognized
a periodicity that

00:47:12.930 --> 00:47:16.040
allows you to predict
pieces way down

00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:19.240
the line simply by applying
the same determinist

00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:21.000
rule over and over.

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:26.400
This would be a system that's
both determinist and periodic.

00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:29.390
Now, in contrast,
you can get a system

00:47:29.390 --> 00:47:32.670
which is determinist,
but aperiodic,

00:47:32.670 --> 00:47:35.220
which is where we're
heading very quickly.

00:47:35.220 --> 00:47:39.440
You have some system where
there's a sequence of numbers.

00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:44.570
There's a sequence of places
on a three-dimensional matrix.

00:47:44.570 --> 00:47:45.820
There's a sequence.

00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:49.470
And there are rules for
how you go from each step

00:47:49.470 --> 00:47:51.540
to the next one.

00:47:51.540 --> 00:47:54.690
But the thing is, you can't
just apply the same rule

00:47:54.690 --> 00:47:55.990
over and over.

00:47:55.990 --> 00:47:59.270
You cannot sit here and say,
if we start at number five,

00:47:59.270 --> 00:48:02.430
and given what the rule is, I
know what it's going to look

00:48:02.430 --> 00:48:04.850
like 10 of these down.

00:48:04.850 --> 00:48:07.680
The only way to
know is to see what

00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:09.980
five produces, as the
first step, what that

00:48:09.980 --> 00:48:11.760
produces as the second step.

00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:14.400
You cannot see periodicity.

00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:17.090
You cannot see
patterns that repeat.

00:48:17.090 --> 00:48:19.940
The only way to know
the complex form

00:48:19.940 --> 00:48:24.310
is to go stepwise and apply
the rule over and over again.

00:48:24.310 --> 00:48:27.580
Because the relationship
between any one step

00:48:27.580 --> 00:48:30.650
here is going to be
different from any other one.

00:48:30.650 --> 00:48:32.150
Here, it's always the same.

00:48:32.150 --> 00:48:35.630
Each one is one higher,
straight-forward, additive.

00:48:35.630 --> 00:48:37.630
You just keep doing it
over and over again.

00:48:37.630 --> 00:48:41.530
In an aperiodic
system you have rules.

00:48:41.530 --> 00:48:43.295
It's determinist.

00:48:43.295 --> 00:48:46.850
But the rules are
such that the spaces,

00:48:46.850 --> 00:48:49.560
the difference with each
step, is not constant.

00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:52.520
The only way you can know
what the number is going

00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:55.310
to be like x number
of rounds down

00:48:55.310 --> 00:48:57.620
is you got to do
this, and then this,

00:48:57.620 --> 00:48:59.200
and then this, and then this.

00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:01.830
This is an aperiodic system.

00:49:01.830 --> 00:49:04.150
At any given one
of these points,

00:49:04.150 --> 00:49:06.480
the rules exist for
you to know what

00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:08.730
the next one is going to be.

00:49:08.730 --> 00:49:10.740
But the rules
don't exist for you

00:49:10.740 --> 00:49:14.030
to know what the one
two down is going to be,

00:49:14.030 --> 00:49:16.360
unless you figure
out what this one is.

00:49:16.360 --> 00:49:19.440
You've got to march through
in that sort of way.

00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:20.910
It's aperiodic.

00:49:20.910 --> 00:49:26.630
There are no patterns that can
be used over and over again.

00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:29.300
The third version
is one that people

00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:31.830
mistake for what I'm
talking about here, which

00:49:31.830 --> 00:49:35.640
is a system which is
nondeterminist because there

00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:37.510
is randomness in there.

00:49:37.510 --> 00:49:40.690
And in that one, going from
this one to the next one,

00:49:40.690 --> 00:49:41.830
there is no rule.

00:49:41.830 --> 00:49:44.520
It's totally random what the
next number is going to be.

00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:46.950
And the one after that
is totally random.

00:49:46.950 --> 00:49:50.372
In that one, you have
no predictability.

00:49:50.372 --> 00:49:52.830
You're going to have to go
every single step down the line.

00:49:52.830 --> 00:49:55.070
But it's not a
determinist system.

00:49:55.070 --> 00:49:56.920
There's no set of
rules that are being

00:49:56.920 --> 00:49:59.090
applied over and over again.

00:49:59.090 --> 00:50:03.780
The nature of this one does
not specify the nature of that.

00:50:03.780 --> 00:50:06.060
It's not determinist
in that way.

00:50:06.060 --> 00:50:08.450
That's not what we're going
to be interested in here,

00:50:08.450 --> 00:50:10.430
where randomness comes in.

00:50:10.430 --> 00:50:13.750
What all of these non-linear
systems are about,

00:50:13.750 --> 00:50:17.900
these chaotic systems are ones
where they are determinist.

00:50:17.900 --> 00:50:21.090
There's rules for how you
go every step along the way.

00:50:21.090 --> 00:50:26.080
But the relationship, given
any given step, is non-linear.

00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:27.370
They're not identical.

00:50:27.370 --> 00:50:29.410
And thus, the only
way to know what's

00:50:29.410 --> 00:50:31.740
happening two down
from here is to know

00:50:31.740 --> 00:50:35.030
what's happening one down,
the only way to do that.

00:50:35.030 --> 00:50:39.240
And thus by definition, this
cannot be a system where

00:50:39.240 --> 00:50:42.580
knowing the starting state
allows you to know the mature

00:50:42.580 --> 00:50:43.080
system.

00:50:43.080 --> 00:50:45.460
Without having to go through
every single calculation

00:50:45.460 --> 00:50:47.740
and knowing the mature
state, doesn't tell you

00:50:47.740 --> 00:50:49.700
what the starting
state was unless you

00:50:49.700 --> 00:50:53.470
are willing to do all the back
calculations because it's not

00:50:53.470 --> 00:50:55.740
reductive in that sense.

00:50:55.740 --> 00:50:59.210
Where would this begin to
sort of manifest itself?

00:50:59.210 --> 00:50:59.760
OK.

00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:03.800
Into the Chaos book, and I
think it was page 27 or so,

00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:06.410
that you get the water wheel
coming up for the first time.

00:51:06.410 --> 00:51:09.390
And go and look at this
picture, obsess over it,

00:51:09.390 --> 00:51:11.480
understand what
that page is about.

00:51:11.480 --> 00:51:14.950
Because it begins to
show how these properties

00:51:14.950 --> 00:51:20.790
of non-linear aperiodicity wind
up producing chaotic systems.

00:51:20.790 --> 00:51:21.290
OK.

00:51:21.290 --> 00:51:22.680
So you've got this water wheel.

00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:24.590
And it's got these buckets here.

00:51:24.590 --> 00:51:26.980
And they've got
holes in the bottom.

00:51:26.980 --> 00:51:29.990
And you can have a very
simple steady state.

00:51:29.990 --> 00:51:32.440
You just put in a little
bit of water, such

00:51:32.440 --> 00:51:34.800
that the water is basically,
as soon as it gets here,

00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:35.670
it's running out.

00:51:35.670 --> 00:51:37.150
It's coming out
in the same state.

00:51:37.150 --> 00:51:38.540
This never fills.

00:51:38.540 --> 00:51:41.450
The water wheel doesn't turn.

00:51:41.450 --> 00:51:45.420
Now, you begin to fill
up at a higher rate.

00:51:45.420 --> 00:51:48.630
And what that does is it's
a little bit asymmetrical.

00:51:48.630 --> 00:51:52.360
This is heavy enough that it now
begins to push the wheel down.

00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:54.390
And as it's going
down, this next one

00:51:54.390 --> 00:51:56.110
is getting filled,
and this next one.

00:51:56.110 --> 00:51:58.500
And all the while,
it's emptying out.

00:51:58.500 --> 00:52:03.000
So a constant input of water,
a rate of things emptying,

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:04.960
the wheel turns.

00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:08.620
It's possible to get a rate
at which you're pouring water

00:52:08.620 --> 00:52:11.490
into the system, where
it will do precisely

00:52:11.490 --> 00:52:13.690
that for the rest of time.

00:52:13.690 --> 00:52:16.390
It will turn at a set speed.

00:52:16.390 --> 00:52:17.655
It is a steady state.

00:52:17.655 --> 00:52:19.630
It is in the equilibrium state.

00:52:19.630 --> 00:52:23.520
It is stable such that
if you sit here right now

00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:27.240
and somebody tells you, in
a circumstance like this,

00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:30.210
the wheel is turning this
fast, in this direction,

00:52:30.210 --> 00:52:32.540
with this force,
you can sit there

00:52:32.540 --> 00:52:35.070
and you can tell them
thus exactly what it

00:52:35.070 --> 00:52:39.590
will be doing 4,070 years
from now on Tuesday afternoon.

00:52:39.590 --> 00:52:41.650
It is a periodic system.

00:52:41.650 --> 00:52:43.580
You don't have to
sit there and go

00:52:43.580 --> 00:52:47.040
through every second between
now and 4,000 years from now.

00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:48.750
It is steady state.

00:52:48.750 --> 00:52:52.950
And you can apply a periodic--
there's periodicity.

00:52:52.950 --> 00:52:56.450
There's a reductive
quality to it.

00:52:56.450 --> 00:52:59.440
Now, what you do is
you put in the water

00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:02.040
with a little more force.

00:53:02.040 --> 00:53:04.680
And what begins to
happen is the wheel

00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:07.790
turns faster because
the wheel is filling up

00:53:07.790 --> 00:53:08.950
with water faster.

00:53:08.950 --> 00:53:10.712
So it's moving this way faster.

00:53:10.712 --> 00:53:11.730
And that's great.

00:53:11.730 --> 00:53:13.010
That's totally logical.

00:53:13.010 --> 00:53:15.120
But at some point,
if you're doing that,

00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:18.770
there's going to be too
little time for these buckets

00:53:18.770 --> 00:53:20.050
to empty out.

00:53:20.050 --> 00:53:22.590
They're going to start
having more water

00:53:22.590 --> 00:53:24.580
when they're coming
up on this side

00:53:24.580 --> 00:53:27.710
because it's moving fast enough,
but they are not emptying.

00:53:27.710 --> 00:53:31.760
And at some point, there's going
to be enough water left here

00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:35.260
that it will suddenly
change direction.

00:53:35.260 --> 00:53:36.180
OK.

00:53:36.180 --> 00:53:39.090
It's possible, if you get the
water pressure just right,

00:53:39.090 --> 00:53:42.220
that you can get a steady
state pattern there.

00:53:42.220 --> 00:53:44.240
It will go around
three times when you're

00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:45.560
putting water with a speed.

00:53:45.560 --> 00:53:48.900
It will go around three times at
this speed and with this force.

00:53:48.900 --> 00:53:52.350
And when it has gone
around 3.73 times,

00:53:52.350 --> 00:53:55.170
it will change
direction for 1.7 turns.

00:53:55.170 --> 00:53:58.130
And then it will go
3.7 times around.

00:53:58.130 --> 00:54:00.970
And once again,
it's a periodicity.

00:54:00.970 --> 00:54:04.450
It's simply a periodicity
with two components to it,

00:54:04.450 --> 00:54:06.340
two changes of directions.

00:54:06.340 --> 00:54:08.420
The first time,
you're going this way.

00:54:08.420 --> 00:54:09.920
And, oops, this fills up.

00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:12.260
So you have your first
change of direction.

00:54:12.260 --> 00:54:15.000
And then, at some
point, the balance

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:17.860
is such that you get your
second change of direction

00:54:17.860 --> 00:54:20.540
and you start the
process all over again.

00:54:20.540 --> 00:54:23.900
There is a pattern, a
periodic pattern to it,

00:54:23.900 --> 00:54:26.570
that just happens to
have two components.

00:54:26.570 --> 00:54:29.580
You've doubled the number
of components in it

00:54:29.580 --> 00:54:31.750
by putting more
force in the system.

00:54:31.750 --> 00:54:33.580
But once you
understand that rule,

00:54:33.580 --> 00:54:36.660
OK, this speed at this rate,
with this force of water,

00:54:36.660 --> 00:54:38.701
it's going to change
direction at this point

00:54:38.701 --> 00:54:39.700
for this length of time.

00:54:39.700 --> 00:54:41.450
Then it's going to
change direction again.

00:54:41.450 --> 00:54:44.270
Knowing that, you can
now sit here and be

00:54:44.270 --> 00:54:48.360
told exactly how full,
how fast, with what force.

00:54:48.360 --> 00:54:50.070
And you could now
tell exactly what

00:54:50.070 --> 00:54:53.660
this water wheel is going to
be doing 4,700 years from now.

00:54:53.660 --> 00:54:57.820
It is still a reductive
periodic system.

00:54:57.820 --> 00:55:00.990
Now, you put in the water
with even more force.

00:55:00.990 --> 00:55:03.720
And what you begin to
see is, as the wheel

00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:06.160
is moving fast
enough, it will have

00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:08.210
sort of this first
spin in this direction

00:55:08.210 --> 00:55:09.920
and then it will
change direction.

00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:14.710
And because the buckets are now
emptying out that much slower

00:55:14.710 --> 00:55:17.080
compared to the rate at
which the water is coming in,

00:55:17.080 --> 00:55:20.645
it will change direction
once more, and once more

00:55:20.645 --> 00:55:22.280
back this way.

00:55:22.280 --> 00:55:24.205
And you're back to
your starting point.

00:55:24.205 --> 00:55:28.570
In other words now, we have a
completely periodic reductive

00:55:28.570 --> 00:55:31.410
system that has four
components in it,

00:55:31.410 --> 00:55:33.960
four changes of
directions before you

00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:38.310
get back to exactly the starting
point and do it all over again.

00:55:38.310 --> 00:55:42.870
You have simply gotten a more
complex version of a totally

00:55:42.870 --> 00:55:45.980
predictable periodic system.

00:55:45.980 --> 00:55:49.250
And what you see is, as you put
in more and more water force

00:55:49.250 --> 00:55:53.250
in there, you keep getting
doublings of your periods.

00:55:53.250 --> 00:55:55.520
You will now get
spinning, where it

00:55:55.520 --> 00:55:58.150
goes through eight
changes of directions

00:55:58.150 --> 00:56:01.310
before it starts the exact thing
over again, and doing that.

00:56:01.310 --> 00:56:03.200
And you can still
predict 4,000 years

00:56:03.200 --> 00:56:05.920
from now, 1632, all of that.

00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:07.790
And throughout,
you can be graphing

00:56:07.790 --> 00:56:10.120
on a sort of way
of representing it.

00:56:10.120 --> 00:56:13.160
This is the simple system here.

00:56:13.160 --> 00:56:14.880
That's the single rotation.

00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:17.220
Here's when you get
a first doubling.

00:56:17.220 --> 00:56:18.640
Then it does
something like that.

00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:21.010
Here's when you're--
you get the point.

00:56:21.010 --> 00:56:22.840
You can represent it that way.

00:56:22.840 --> 00:56:26.720
And you see it is still, you
let it keep running like this

00:56:26.720 --> 00:56:30.720
and there will be the same
periodicity, the same pattern,

00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:33.010
that will go over and
over for the rest of time.

00:56:33.010 --> 00:56:36.130
It's still a reductive
periodic system.

00:56:36.130 --> 00:56:38.860
It's just gotten
more complicated.

00:56:38.860 --> 00:56:42.830
And then, somewhere in
the doubling process,

00:56:42.830 --> 00:56:44.770
something happens.

00:56:44.770 --> 00:56:46.590
And the something
that happens is

00:56:46.590 --> 00:56:51.130
it becomes a non-linear
chaotic system.

00:56:51.130 --> 00:56:54.790
As you increase the force
on the system, the force

00:56:54.790 --> 00:56:57.760
here being the force of
water coming in there,

00:56:57.760 --> 00:57:00.870
at some point with the
force of water increasing,

00:57:00.870 --> 00:57:04.560
it's going to stop this
perfect periodic doubling

00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:07.540
of the components and
it's going to shift over

00:57:07.540 --> 00:57:09.560
to a chaotic pattern now.

00:57:09.560 --> 00:57:12.240
How do you define that
as a chaotic pattern?

00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:14.855
It will shift over to
a pattern of spinning

00:57:14.855 --> 00:57:16.980
this way and then back for
a while, and going then.

00:57:16.980 --> 00:57:21.330
It will generate a pattern
which never repeats.

00:57:21.330 --> 00:57:24.490
There's no periodicity anymore.

00:57:24.490 --> 00:57:28.280
It generates a pattern that
is going to be infinitely

00:57:28.280 --> 00:57:31.110
different along the way.

00:57:31.110 --> 00:57:33.370
Because you're putting that
much force in the system,

00:57:33.370 --> 00:57:36.050
it has become chaotic.

00:57:36.050 --> 00:57:40.960
And what is obvious here, as
an implication, is knowing here

00:57:40.960 --> 00:57:44.010
gives you no predictive
value's ability

00:57:44.010 --> 00:57:46.290
of what's happening
4,000 years from now.

00:57:46.290 --> 00:57:50.310
The only way to know what's
happening 4,000 years from now

00:57:50.310 --> 00:57:53.400
is to study what the wheel
does for 4,000 years.

00:57:53.400 --> 00:57:57.430
You can't sit there and
recognize a periodicity

00:57:57.430 --> 00:58:00.430
and just do it over
again and again.

00:58:00.430 --> 00:58:02.440
And what the
discovery of chaos was

00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:07.780
about was that in structured,
reductive, linear systems,

00:58:07.780 --> 00:58:10.270
when you increase the
amount of force on it,

00:58:10.270 --> 00:58:12.440
there is a doubling and
quadrupling and all of that.

00:58:12.440 --> 00:58:14.390
It just gets more
complicated and reductive.

00:58:14.390 --> 00:58:17.360
That there is a transition
point, where it suddenly

00:58:17.360 --> 00:58:21.450
becomes chaotic and the
pattern never, ever repeats.

00:58:21.450 --> 00:58:23.740
And there is no predictability.

00:58:23.740 --> 00:58:26.790
And sort of the founding
generation of chaosists,

00:58:26.790 --> 00:58:29.980
this is what they were showing,
with things like water wheels,

00:58:29.980 --> 00:58:32.140
where you can see
the exact same thing.

00:58:32.140 --> 00:58:34.220
You have a cylinder.

00:58:34.220 --> 00:58:36.030
And what you're
applying in here--

00:58:36.030 --> 00:58:37.190
and it's filled with water.

00:58:37.190 --> 00:58:39.320
And you're applying
heat to the system.

00:58:39.320 --> 00:58:43.210
And what you begin to get
after awhile is convections

00:58:43.210 --> 00:58:44.580
or whatever.

00:58:44.580 --> 00:58:45.500
Stuff moves.

00:58:45.500 --> 00:58:48.280
And as you heat it even
more, changes direction.

00:58:48.280 --> 00:58:49.410
It's the same thing.

00:58:49.410 --> 00:58:51.670
And at some point, when
the heat gets high enough,

00:58:51.670 --> 00:58:53.850
it breaks into boiling.

00:58:53.850 --> 00:58:55.620
It breaks into turbulence.

00:58:55.620 --> 00:59:00.150
It breaks into a chaotic system,
where there's no periodicity.

00:59:00.150 --> 00:59:02.210
There is no repeating
of these patterns.

00:59:02.210 --> 00:59:05.810
And an amazing insight by
one of the first people

00:59:05.810 --> 00:59:09.490
in the field, this guy
Yorke, was that any time you

00:59:09.490 --> 00:59:13.080
see periodicity
of an odd number,

00:59:13.080 --> 00:59:16.680
you've just guaranteed that
you've entered chaotic terrain.

00:59:16.680 --> 00:59:19.410
That, as he called
it, period three,

00:59:19.410 --> 00:59:22.680
as soon as you're going
instead of a single period,

00:59:22.680 --> 00:59:25.270
a double, four, eight,
whatever, as soon

00:59:25.270 --> 00:59:29.190
as you see the first evidence
assumes any system like this

00:59:29.190 --> 00:59:33.450
begins to have three components
before the pattern repeats,

00:59:33.450 --> 00:59:38.080
it's about to disappear
into a chaoticism.

00:59:38.080 --> 00:59:41.050
So this is what a chaotic
system is about, which

00:59:41.050 --> 00:59:43.910
is you have a starting state.

00:59:43.910 --> 00:59:46.470
And as you increase the
force on the system,

00:59:46.470 --> 00:59:49.820
the periodicity, the
predictability, breaks down.

00:59:49.820 --> 00:59:52.570
And eventually, you get
as the critical thing,

00:59:52.570 --> 00:59:55.720
a pattern which never repeats.

00:59:55.720 --> 00:59:59.230
And thus, the only way to
know what that pattern will

00:59:59.230 --> 01:00:02.500
be doing x amount of
time down the line

01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:06.240
is to run the system
from now until time x.

01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:08.680
There is no
predictability from here

01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:10.450
as to what's happening at x.

01:00:10.450 --> 01:00:12.790
You gotta sit there
and march through it

01:00:12.790 --> 01:00:16.290
because it's an aperiodic
system, rather than one

01:00:16.290 --> 01:00:17.940
like this.

01:00:17.940 --> 01:00:21.580
So what the entire sort of
starting point for chaosists

01:00:21.580 --> 01:00:24.870
was, that you get these
nonlinear systems.

01:00:24.870 --> 01:00:27.930
And people had been noting them,
mathematicians, physicists,

01:00:27.930 --> 01:00:30.850
whatever, in systems like
that for a long time.

01:00:30.850 --> 01:00:33.770
And the longer they do,
right around the point

01:00:33.770 --> 01:00:35.900
that things would
become chaotic,

01:00:35.900 --> 01:00:39.720
they would say, well, this is
just getting perturbed by now.

01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:42.320
It's not functioning
properly anymore

01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:46.190
because it's not working in
a linear, periodic manner.

01:00:46.190 --> 01:00:49.260
Something's wrong with
the system, something

01:00:49.260 --> 01:00:52.320
along the lines of
noise and variability.

01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:56.010
We will stop studying
it up to that point.

01:00:56.010 --> 01:00:58.670
And if you say, we're
going to stop studying it

01:00:58.670 --> 01:01:01.500
until it gets to that point,
the last bit of periodicity,

01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:05.180
what do you come away with, a
very distorted view that all

01:01:05.180 --> 01:01:06.940
the interesting
things in the world

01:01:06.940 --> 01:01:09.720
work in reductive
periodic systems.

01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:11.660
Because what you've
just done is say,

01:01:11.660 --> 01:01:13.940
I'm getting totally
disturbed by these nonlinear

01:01:13.940 --> 01:01:16.540
chaotic things that
happen at an extreme.

01:01:16.540 --> 01:01:19.820
So I'm going to decide
they are just anomalies.

01:01:19.820 --> 01:01:22.140
And we're only going
to study in this domain

01:01:22.140 --> 01:01:24.570
and reach the conclusion
that the entire world works

01:01:24.570 --> 01:01:26.100
in this domain.

01:01:26.100 --> 01:01:30.640
Kind of like behavior
geneticists, who say, oh,

01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:33.340
I want to understand the
heritability of a trait.

01:01:33.340 --> 01:01:35.560
And I want to understand
it very cleanly.

01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:39.550
So we're going to study it
in only one environment.

01:01:39.550 --> 01:01:41.790
Because if you study in
a bunch of environments,

01:01:41.790 --> 01:01:44.940
it gets noisy, and
variable, and messy data.

01:01:44.940 --> 01:01:45.930
No, it doesn't.

01:01:45.930 --> 01:01:49.470
It is showing you that
the heritability is zilch.

01:01:49.470 --> 01:01:53.680
It's showing you that you have
just artificially excluded

01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:56.920
your ability to see
what's actually happening.

01:01:56.920 --> 01:01:59.350
And the founding
generation of the chaosists

01:01:59.350 --> 01:02:01.490
took the stance
that what you've got

01:02:01.490 --> 01:02:04.960
is all the interesting
stuff about complex systems

01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:09.060
out there, are all functioning
out in the chaotic realm.

01:02:09.060 --> 01:02:11.820
And what science has been
spending forever doing

01:02:11.820 --> 01:02:14.920
is looking the other way and
pretending it's not there.

01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:18.290
And restricting the
studying of complex systems

01:02:18.290 --> 01:02:21.300
to just these first
baby step domains

01:02:21.300 --> 01:02:23.430
of the periodic doubling.

01:02:23.430 --> 01:02:25.800
Most of the world is doing this.

01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:31.130
And most of science has worked
very, very hard to ignore this.

01:02:31.130 --> 01:02:34.620
So once you get this, you begin
to get some really interesting

01:02:34.620 --> 01:02:35.920
implications.

01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:37.390
So now you find a way.

01:02:37.390 --> 01:02:40.120
You get one of these
chaotic systems

01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:42.500
and you first study
it when it is still

01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:45.050
in the nice straightforward
periodic way.

01:02:45.050 --> 01:02:46.740
A little bit of
water is coming in.

01:02:46.740 --> 01:02:48.920
And it's turning like
this, at a set speed.

01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:50.750
And come back 4,000
years from now

01:02:50.750 --> 01:02:52.730
and it will still be
doing it the exact thing.

01:02:52.730 --> 01:02:55.960
It's a great periodic system.

01:02:55.960 --> 01:02:59.930
And you can come up with a
graph of which direction it's

01:02:59.930 --> 01:03:02.880
turning, would be here or here.

01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:05.170
And how fast, with what
work force, whatever.

01:03:05.170 --> 01:03:08.510
And you will come up
with a single dot, which

01:03:08.510 --> 01:03:13.720
represents this rotating in this
direction, at this set speed.

01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:16.840
And this is this point
of stability, this point

01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:18.720
of complete predictability.

01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:21.900
A feature of a periodic
system like this,

01:03:21.900 --> 01:03:24.810
when it's in this boring
linear reductive way,

01:03:24.810 --> 01:03:27.800
is you can mess with it.

01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:29.500
And after a little
bit of time, it

01:03:29.500 --> 01:03:31.830
will settle back
into the same system.

01:03:31.830 --> 01:03:35.600
You briefly hold the water wheel
and that throws things off.

01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:38.160
And then you let it go and it
goes back to what it was doing.

01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:39.880
And it will take a
little bit of time

01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:42.130
for it to go back
to where it started.

01:03:42.130 --> 01:03:43.750
And a way of viewing
this graphically

01:03:43.750 --> 01:03:45.210
is it's doing this forever.

01:03:45.210 --> 01:03:46.640
And now, you go mess with it.

01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:47.370
You hold it.

01:03:47.370 --> 01:03:49.650
You turn off the water
for a second, whatever.

01:03:49.650 --> 01:03:53.170
And for a while, it does
this, and it does this,

01:03:53.170 --> 01:03:54.680
and does this, and does this.

01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:58.090
And eventually, it gets
pulled back to this spot.

01:03:58.090 --> 01:04:02.640
It goes back to this point of
stability, of predictability.

01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:06.920
It is attracted to this point.

01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:10.950
And, thus, the linear systems
like this have attractors.

01:04:10.950 --> 01:04:14.060
Something where, when
you mess with it,

01:04:14.060 --> 01:04:17.920
the system will equilibrate
and go back to where it was,

01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:22.202
attracted to the "real"
solution to the problem.

01:04:22.202 --> 01:04:24.160
And if you are looking
at it at any point here,

01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:26.320
and it's not here, because
it is here instead,

01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:28.240
and it is here instead,
and here instead,

01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:30.780
all that is noise in the system.

01:04:30.780 --> 01:04:33.100
And you're in the process
of getting rid of the noise,

01:04:33.100 --> 01:04:38.810
back to the pure, perfect state,
the pure, perfect description

01:04:38.810 --> 01:04:41.800
of how the system works.

01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:45.260
So now, you look at what's
going on when instead you've

01:04:45.260 --> 01:04:48.870
got it to the point of
chaos, a chaotic system.

01:04:48.870 --> 01:04:53.520
And what you see is--
OK, let's assume that was

01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:55.210
where the attractor was.

01:04:55.210 --> 01:04:57.990
And what you see is
when you're mapping

01:04:57.990 --> 01:05:00.820
the speed, the direction
that it's turning,

01:05:00.820 --> 01:05:03.540
the force, all of
that, it's doing this.

01:05:03.540 --> 01:05:05.709
And it will do this for a
while, and will do this.

01:05:05.709 --> 01:05:08.000
And it will reach that critical
point where suddenly it

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:09.370
changes direction.

01:05:09.370 --> 01:05:11.140
And will do this for
a while, and then it

01:05:11.140 --> 01:05:13.880
will change direction again,
and then this, and this.

01:05:13.880 --> 01:05:17.440
And what you have is this
butterfly wing pattern,

01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:21.030
that became one of the
iconic images in early chaos.

01:05:21.030 --> 01:05:23.170
What do you have here?

01:05:23.170 --> 01:05:26.610
You've got a description of
how the system is working now.

01:05:26.610 --> 01:05:28.910
Once it's hit this
chaotism, it's

01:05:28.910 --> 01:05:33.020
not settling down into
a repeating pattern.

01:05:33.020 --> 01:05:36.490
The fact that it is never
here, and staying there,

01:05:36.490 --> 01:05:39.200
that's the business that
you could never predict.

01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:41.650
It is constantly oscillating.

01:05:41.650 --> 01:05:44.690
It is constantly chaotic.

01:05:44.690 --> 01:05:47.390
So now you ask,
and you say, well,

01:05:47.390 --> 01:05:50.420
that's pretty strange
because it's not actually

01:05:50.420 --> 01:05:51.890
touching the spot.

01:05:51.890 --> 01:05:53.670
But it just keeps
going around it.

01:05:53.670 --> 01:05:57.680
It's clearly pulled to it, but
in a very different sort of way

01:05:57.680 --> 01:06:01.180
than when you get a perturbation
and quickly it does this.

01:06:01.180 --> 01:06:04.670
This is being attracted back
to this pure starting point.

01:06:04.670 --> 01:06:07.200
And here, it never
actually quite gets there.

01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:09.210
But it's sort of
being pulled by it.

01:06:09.210 --> 01:06:10.150
What do we have here?

01:06:10.150 --> 01:06:13.350
We have a strange attractor.

01:06:13.350 --> 01:06:16.310
And that was the terminology
that came into the field.

01:06:16.310 --> 01:06:19.990
A regular old attractor
is one that will pull down

01:06:19.990 --> 01:06:22.410
to a single stable point.

01:06:22.410 --> 01:06:25.860
This is the predictable,
utterly predictable, state

01:06:25.860 --> 01:06:27.770
of the system right now.

01:06:27.770 --> 01:06:32.250
A stranger attractor is one
that has to do with the fact

01:06:32.250 --> 01:06:34.250
that it's going to
oscillate like this.

01:06:34.250 --> 01:06:38.776
But it's never going to settle
down into a single point.

01:06:38.776 --> 01:06:43.380
And suddenly, there's a very
different implication there.

01:06:43.380 --> 01:06:46.310
Because here, when
you're not yet

01:06:46.310 --> 01:06:49.070
at this spot, what's this spot?

01:06:49.070 --> 01:06:50.090
It's noise.

01:06:50.090 --> 01:06:51.420
Its variability.

01:06:51.420 --> 01:06:55.030
And hang on and it's going to go
away because it will eventually

01:06:55.030 --> 01:06:58.410
reach the real answer.

01:06:58.410 --> 01:07:00.830
In systems with
strange attractors,

01:07:00.830 --> 01:07:03.210
what do you make
of the variability?

01:07:03.210 --> 01:07:04.610
It's not noise.

01:07:04.610 --> 01:07:06.980
It is the phenomenon.

01:07:06.980 --> 01:07:10.500
There is no absolute
pure answer in there.

01:07:10.500 --> 01:07:14.670
There is not some idealized,
the real correct answer.

01:07:14.670 --> 01:07:16.620
And you're just
fluxing around here.

01:07:16.620 --> 01:07:19.760
And if only you had better
control of the system,

01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:22.062
you would eventually get
it to look like this.

01:07:22.062 --> 01:07:23.500
This is a myth.

01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:25.430
This is imaginary.

01:07:25.430 --> 01:07:29.390
In complex systems,
there is no answer

01:07:29.390 --> 01:07:32.380
as to what you are
supposed to be observing

01:07:32.380 --> 01:07:35.440
and everything else
is variable noise.

01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:39.085
This is the system itself.

01:07:39.085 --> 01:07:43.400
A critical expansion on that,
so you're looking at this

01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:44.960
and you're saying,
OK, what is this?

01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:47.390
This is measuring
in whatever units

01:07:47.390 --> 01:07:50.630
of time, where the wheel is,
what direction, what speed, all

01:07:50.630 --> 01:07:51.130
of that.

01:07:51.130 --> 01:07:53.400
It's a whole bunch
of data points.

01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:55.860
And the data points would
just keep doing this forever

01:07:55.860 --> 01:07:58.040
and ever, unpredictably.

01:07:58.040 --> 01:07:58.860
Wait a second.

01:07:58.860 --> 01:08:04.181
And you say, at some point
it's got to cross here,

01:08:04.181 --> 01:08:05.480
this spot here.

01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:07.260
And at some point
it's circling around

01:08:07.260 --> 01:08:11.090
and will circle and come
through exactly that point.

01:08:11.090 --> 01:08:16.340
And right now at that point, if
you apply the same equations,

01:08:16.340 --> 01:08:20.399
the same determinist
rules, right at that point,

01:08:20.399 --> 01:08:22.744
the next point should be this.

01:08:22.744 --> 01:08:24.160
And the next point
should be this.

01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:26.109
And what have you just done?

01:08:26.109 --> 01:08:28.430
You're beginning
to repeat yourself.

01:08:28.430 --> 01:08:30.840
You've just had periodicity.

01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:32.970
Wait, this really isn't chaotic.

01:08:32.970 --> 01:08:35.930
As soon as it hits the
same point that was there

01:08:35.930 --> 01:08:38.864
previously, it suddenly
should repeat the pattern

01:08:38.864 --> 01:08:39.810
all over again.

01:08:39.810 --> 01:08:41.090
It's periodic.

01:08:41.090 --> 01:08:42.950
It stopped being
a chaotic system.

01:08:42.950 --> 01:08:43.880
How can this be?

01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:45.870
Because they've got to
touch the same points.

01:08:45.870 --> 01:08:47.060
Look at all that.

01:08:47.060 --> 01:08:49.210
And this was the
next critical concept

01:08:49.210 --> 01:08:53.660
in the field, which is you can
look at this point and maybe

01:08:53.660 --> 01:08:59.859
its coordinates, 6, 3, in a
standard graph or whatever.

01:08:59.859 --> 01:09:01.710
And that's what
the coordinate was

01:09:01.710 --> 01:09:03.160
the first time it was there.

01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:06.710
And now, spinning around, it's
just come there a second time.

01:09:06.710 --> 01:09:08.640
It's back in the same spot.

01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:10.359
Oh, no, it's repeating.

01:09:10.359 --> 01:09:12.600
It isn't chaotic
and unpredictable

01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:14.240
and going on for an infinity.

01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:16.430
And it just fell apart.

01:09:16.430 --> 01:09:18.779
It doesn't really work
this way, until you

01:09:18.779 --> 01:09:21.090
look a little bit closer.

01:09:21.090 --> 01:09:22.990
And you look a
little bit closer.

01:09:22.990 --> 01:09:26.170
And it turns out
this is not 6 and 3.

01:09:26.170 --> 01:09:30.729
This coordinate
was actually 3.7.

01:09:30.729 --> 01:09:32.359
And you look closer here.

01:09:32.359 --> 01:09:36.050
And this one was 3.8.

01:09:36.050 --> 01:09:40.689
In other words, it's not
really in the exact same spot.

01:09:40.689 --> 01:09:44.330
It never gets to the
same exact spot again.

01:09:44.330 --> 01:09:45.330
Where is it then?

01:09:45.330 --> 01:09:46.890
Well, we really measured it now.

01:09:46.890 --> 01:09:49.432
And, in fact, both
of them are 3.7.

01:09:49.432 --> 01:09:50.660
It's the exact same.

01:09:50.660 --> 01:09:54.600
And look a little bit closer,
an order of magnitude closer,

01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:56.370
and there be it.

01:09:56.370 --> 01:09:59.460
And take it out a
million decimal places

01:09:59.460 --> 01:10:02.100
and they still look like
they're in the exact same point,

01:10:02.100 --> 01:10:05.440
a million small places
out in terms of accuracy.

01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:09.440
And a million and one is where
they will differ a little bit.

01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:13.610
And thus, they're
not in the same spot.

01:10:13.610 --> 01:10:19.330
Critical next concept with this,
which is if that's the case

01:10:19.330 --> 01:10:23.490
and there are a million
decimal places out there,

01:10:23.490 --> 01:10:27.590
they are differing by one
decimal place way out there,

01:10:27.590 --> 01:10:31.170
what that means is the
fact that one of them,

01:10:31.170 --> 01:10:35.960
4,000 digits out there,
is 8.2-- and notice,

01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:40.250
an 8.3 and a gazillion
zeroes before that-- that

01:10:40.250 --> 01:10:45.300
means at some point this is
going to function differently

01:10:45.300 --> 01:10:46.891
than this.

01:10:46.891 --> 01:10:51.210
This will produce a
different spot than that.

01:10:51.210 --> 01:10:54.110
They won't go to
the same next place

01:10:54.110 --> 01:10:56.690
because they're actually
different numbers.

01:10:56.690 --> 01:11:00.840
And if a million digits
out, that tiny difference,

01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:05.360
will change the functioning of
that, a million minus 1 digits

01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:07.700
out there, that will
then potentially

01:11:07.700 --> 01:11:10.860
change the functioning of
a million minus 2 digits

01:11:10.860 --> 01:11:12.940
out there, all the way up.

01:11:12.940 --> 01:11:17.410
In other words, the consequences
of this tiny little difference

01:11:17.410 --> 01:11:19.720
gets amplified.

01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:23.250
And this is what's called
the butterfly effect.

01:11:23.250 --> 01:11:25.450
In the standard sort
of jargon in the field,

01:11:25.450 --> 01:11:30.050
the butterfly effect is the fact
that the way a butterfly flaps

01:11:30.050 --> 01:11:36.560
its wings in Korea will change
the weather system in Indiana.

01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:39.140
And this is absolutely the case.

01:11:39.140 --> 01:11:41.370
Because of these
butterfly effects,

01:11:41.370 --> 01:11:45.830
the very local consequences
of something like a butterfly

01:11:45.830 --> 01:11:50.180
flapped its wings versus if
it hadn't flapped its wings,

01:11:50.180 --> 01:11:52.580
would have you just done to
air movement on the planet?

01:11:52.580 --> 01:11:55.010
You are a million
digits out there.

01:11:55.010 --> 01:11:57.750
And you've just changed
that this very last digit

01:11:57.750 --> 01:12:01.660
went from 3 to 4 because the
butterfly flapped its wings.

01:12:01.660 --> 01:12:04.560
And that's going to cause
a difference one digit

01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:06.090
before that, and one digit.

01:12:06.090 --> 01:12:10.150
And these are already
beginning to differ.

01:12:10.150 --> 01:12:13.340
And by the time it gets
up to any level higher,

01:12:13.340 --> 01:12:18.430
it's differing enough that the
next spot will differ as well.

01:12:18.430 --> 01:12:19.540
What are you doing?

01:12:19.540 --> 01:12:22.330
This is why the pattern
can never repeat

01:12:22.330 --> 01:12:24.390
and why it's good
to do this instead.

01:12:24.390 --> 01:12:26.710
Because on some level
of magnification

01:12:26.710 --> 01:12:29.570
in a chaotic system
like this, you never

01:12:29.570 --> 01:12:34.410
have the exact same location,
the exact same coordinates,

01:12:34.410 --> 01:12:36.260
occur a second time.

01:12:36.260 --> 01:12:39.110
Somewhere, however number
of digits out there you

01:12:39.110 --> 01:12:41.790
need to go, the two
of them will differ.

01:12:41.790 --> 01:12:45.570
And that difference can
potentially amplify upward

01:12:45.570 --> 01:12:48.580
in a butterfly effect.

01:12:48.580 --> 01:12:50.960
If you do it that
way, you suddenly

01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:52.520
have a very different view.

01:12:52.520 --> 01:12:56.300
Which is, all the way out, a
gazillion decimal places out

01:12:56.300 --> 01:12:58.832
there, and they
differ like this,

01:12:58.832 --> 01:13:00.600
this isn't noise in the system.

01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:02.370
This isn't variability.

01:13:02.370 --> 01:13:04.630
This is intrinsic to the system.

01:13:04.630 --> 01:13:08.110
And the fact that this
will now expand, amplify

01:13:08.110 --> 01:13:11.260
the consequences, is
why the whole system

01:13:11.260 --> 01:13:14.474
is unpredictable because
of these butterfly effects.

01:13:17.260 --> 01:13:18.020
OK.

01:13:18.020 --> 01:13:21.620
Let me just think about-- oh,
so the critical point here

01:13:21.620 --> 01:13:25.240
is in this strange attractor
realm, not only is there

01:13:25.240 --> 01:13:26.240
no predictability.

01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:27.530
That's an important point.

01:13:27.530 --> 01:13:30.190
And the closer you
look, you will still

01:13:30.190 --> 01:13:32.830
see the same degree
of noise variability.

01:13:32.830 --> 01:13:34.910
Noise is not something
that goes away.

01:13:34.910 --> 01:13:37.810
But almost philosophically,
this critical point

01:13:37.810 --> 01:13:41.220
in a system, a linear boring
system with an attractor,

01:13:41.220 --> 01:13:43.020
this is the answer.

01:13:43.020 --> 01:13:46.360
In chaotic systems,
there's no real answer.

01:13:46.360 --> 01:13:48.420
And if you're out
here, it doesn't

01:13:48.420 --> 01:13:52.326
mean that you're not correct,
you're not quite there.

01:13:52.326 --> 01:13:54.410
There is no there there.

01:13:54.410 --> 01:13:57.810
The notion that there is
a solution at the center

01:13:57.810 --> 01:14:02.600
is a fabrication of the data
oscillating around there.

01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:06.380
There is no correct
idealized answer in there.

01:14:06.380 --> 01:14:09.610
This is the idealized
answer, which

01:14:09.610 --> 01:14:13.640
is a completely
unpredictable system.

01:14:13.640 --> 01:14:14.980
OK.

01:14:14.980 --> 01:14:17.760
What's intrinsic in
this now is the fact

01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:23.110
that even though you now look
an order of magnitude closer,

01:14:23.110 --> 01:14:25.540
there's still this
variability stuff, which

01:14:25.540 --> 01:14:27.420
can amplify, as a
butterfly effect up,

01:14:27.420 --> 01:14:28.750
and make a huge difference.

01:14:28.750 --> 01:14:30.990
And you look an order
of magnitude closer

01:14:30.990 --> 01:14:33.440
and there's still a
butterfly effect potentially.

01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:36.940
And it doesn't matter how
many digits you go down,

01:14:36.940 --> 01:14:42.490
how closely you look, how
good your reductive tools are,

01:14:42.490 --> 01:14:46.370
the variability is still
going to exist down there.

01:14:46.370 --> 01:14:47.840
And the way to
describe this here

01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:52.170
is, thus, this is a
scale-free system.

01:14:52.170 --> 01:14:55.680
The nature of variability
is exactly the same

01:14:55.680 --> 01:14:57.970
if you're looking
at a whole number

01:14:57.970 --> 01:15:00.330
or if you're looking
at a number taken out

01:15:00.330 --> 01:15:04.222
to three decimal places or
three googleplex places,

01:15:04.222 --> 01:15:05.180
and that sort of thing.

01:15:05.180 --> 01:15:08.520
That it's independent of
how many steps down there

01:15:08.520 --> 01:15:10.750
you're examining
the system, the fact

01:15:10.750 --> 01:15:13.040
that there will
still be a difference

01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:15.380
and it can still
butterfly its way up

01:15:15.380 --> 01:15:18.330
to make a difference there,
means that all of this stuff

01:15:18.330 --> 01:15:19.960
is scale-free.

01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:23.910
It doesn't matter how closely
you are looking at it.

01:15:23.910 --> 01:15:27.110
In other words, the whole
reductive philosophy

01:15:27.110 --> 01:15:30.400
of the closer you look,
the better your measurement

01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:34.270
tools, the more variability
is going to go away,

01:15:34.270 --> 01:15:37.540
in a scale-free chaotic
system, regardless

01:15:37.540 --> 01:15:43.810
of what degree of reduction,
of what degree of detail

01:15:43.810 --> 01:15:47.730
you are looking at the system
with, the amount of noise

01:15:47.730 --> 01:15:49.970
is going to proportionally
remain the same

01:15:49.970 --> 01:15:51.380
because it's not noise.

01:15:51.380 --> 01:15:53.040
It is the system.

01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:57.180
So you don't have this reductive
notion that all we need to do

01:15:57.180 --> 01:16:00.550
is get better tools and
look closer and closer

01:16:00.550 --> 01:16:02.630
and noise will go away.

01:16:02.630 --> 01:16:03.940
Because it isn't noise.

01:16:03.940 --> 01:16:07.950
This is the phenomenon
at any scale you look at.

01:16:07.950 --> 01:16:12.460
And this introduces the notion,
thus, of what a fractal is.

01:16:12.460 --> 01:16:16.575
Because a fractal is a complex
pattern, a visual pattern,

01:16:16.575 --> 01:16:20.250
an equation that produces a
pattern, things of that sort,

01:16:20.250 --> 01:16:23.030
where it is scale-free.

01:16:23.030 --> 01:16:26.530
The appearance of it
is the same no matter

01:16:26.530 --> 01:16:28.290
what scale you look at.

01:16:28.290 --> 01:16:31.680
The complexity of it
is the same no matter

01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:33.570
how close you look at it.

01:16:33.570 --> 01:16:37.130
The degree of
variability is the same

01:16:37.130 --> 01:16:38.650
because it's not variability.

01:16:38.650 --> 01:16:40.450
It's intrinsic to the system.

01:16:40.450 --> 01:16:43.540
OK, ways to define a
fractal, because this has

01:16:43.540 --> 01:16:46.267
becomes sort of a very
trendy sort of subject.

01:16:46.267 --> 01:16:47.850
And there's a number
of different ways

01:16:47.850 --> 01:16:49.200
to think about it.

01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:55.530
Most formally, what a
fractal is is information

01:16:55.530 --> 01:16:58.140
that codes for a pattern.

01:16:58.140 --> 01:17:01.670
Where, for example, it can
code for a pattern that

01:17:01.670 --> 01:17:08.420
is a line-- a line-- and thus
is a one-dimensional object.

01:17:08.420 --> 01:17:13.740
But where the line is moving
around with such complexity,

01:17:13.740 --> 01:17:17.100
with such an infinite amount of
complexity, because even if you

01:17:17.100 --> 01:17:20.240
look closer, it's going to be
just as complex, proportionally

01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:21.055
closer and closer.

01:17:21.055 --> 01:17:25.940
In other words, this is going
to be an infinitely long line

01:17:25.940 --> 01:17:28.260
in a finite space.

01:17:28.260 --> 01:17:31.750
Which begins to make it sound
kind of more eventually,

01:17:31.750 --> 01:17:33.650
this is more
beginning to resemble

01:17:33.650 --> 01:17:35.860
a two-dimensional object.

01:17:35.860 --> 01:17:39.680
What a fractal is is some
object, some property, that's

01:17:39.680 --> 01:17:41.980
a fraction of a dimension.

01:17:41.980 --> 01:17:45.080
If this goes on
infinitely, it's a line.

01:17:45.080 --> 01:17:46.710
But it's really much
more than a line.

01:17:46.710 --> 01:17:48.790
But it's not quite
two-dimensional.

01:17:48.790 --> 01:17:51.350
It's 1.3 dimensions.

01:17:51.350 --> 01:17:52.670
It's a fractal.

01:17:52.670 --> 01:17:57.100
A fractal is a system that has
fractional dimensions to it,

01:17:57.100 --> 01:18:00.470
where just the infinite
amount of complexity

01:18:00.470 --> 01:18:03.440
the closer you look, it's
still going to be like this,

01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:06.210
means that this is a
line like no other line.

01:18:06.210 --> 01:18:10.260
It's one that's infinitely
long, packed in a finite space.

01:18:10.260 --> 01:18:11.860
That's more than a line.

01:18:11.860 --> 01:18:13.710
But it's not quite
a two dimensional.

01:18:13.710 --> 01:18:14.820
It's a fraction.

01:18:14.820 --> 01:18:17.160
It's a fraction of a dimension.

01:18:17.160 --> 01:18:21.060
That's the formal mathematical
definition of a fractal.

01:18:21.060 --> 01:18:25.830
For our purposes, it's instead,
as well, no matter how close

01:18:25.830 --> 01:18:29.080
or how far away you look at
it, the amount of variability

01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:30.320
is the same.

01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:34.860
And thus, we have absolutely
a classic fractal system

01:18:34.860 --> 01:18:38.890
if these are canals on Mars
or if these are the dendrites

01:18:38.890 --> 01:18:40.310
of a single neuron.

01:18:40.310 --> 01:18:44.670
No matter what dimension,
with what resolution

01:18:44.670 --> 01:18:47.060
you are looking at
it with, the degree

01:18:47.060 --> 01:18:50.010
of complexity, the
degree of variability,

01:18:50.010 --> 01:18:52.310
remains proportionally constant.

01:18:52.310 --> 01:18:53.530
It's a fractal.

01:18:53.530 --> 01:18:57.130
Bifurcating systems
are classic fractals.

01:18:57.130 --> 01:19:00.050
And the variability
within the system

01:19:00.050 --> 01:19:05.380
is constant regardless of
what scale you are looking at.

01:19:05.380 --> 01:19:08.100
And, thus, is telling
you the variability

01:19:08.100 --> 01:19:10.120
isn't noise variability.

01:19:10.120 --> 01:19:12.962
It's instead, what the
system is actually about.

01:19:16.950 --> 01:19:19.510
So I will look here.

01:19:19.510 --> 01:19:20.950
OK.

01:19:20.950 --> 01:19:23.150
So you see these
fractal properties.

01:19:23.150 --> 01:19:26.230
The circulatory
system is a fractal

01:19:26.230 --> 01:19:28.960
with roughly the same
degree of complexity

01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:32.500
as is the pulmonary system
in its branch points,

01:19:32.500 --> 01:19:35.300
as in the dendrites
of a single neuron,

01:19:35.300 --> 01:19:37.240
as are the branches of a tree.

01:19:37.240 --> 01:19:38.450
They're all fractals.

01:19:38.450 --> 01:19:40.880
Their complexity,
their variability,

01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:42.660
is independent of scale.

01:19:42.660 --> 01:19:45.550
This is what you
begin to see in all

01:19:45.550 --> 01:19:48.720
these physiological
systems, these fractals that

01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:51.140
have equivalent
scales of complexity

01:19:51.140 --> 01:19:54.210
at infinitely different,
vastly different,

01:19:54.210 --> 01:19:56.450
scales of magnification.

01:19:56.450 --> 01:19:59.390
And as a hint of where we're
heading on Friday, what that

01:19:59.390 --> 01:20:02.330
begins to tell you
is you can solve

01:20:02.330 --> 01:20:07.230
this problem of coding for these
vastly bifurcating systems.

01:20:07.230 --> 01:20:09.300
Where this is made
of a billion cells,

01:20:09.300 --> 01:20:11.940
and this is a single
cell, you can use

01:20:11.940 --> 01:20:14.600
some are these similar rules.

01:20:14.600 --> 01:20:17.980
And all the rule has
to be is scale-free.

01:20:17.980 --> 01:20:20.670
We will see exactly what
I mean by that on Friday.

01:20:20.670 --> 01:20:23.470
But this begins to
solve the problem of,

01:20:23.470 --> 01:20:25.340
there's not enough
genes in there.

01:20:25.340 --> 01:20:27.820
And what this
introduces is the notion

01:20:27.820 --> 01:20:32.350
of there being fractal genes,
genes that give instructions

01:20:32.350 --> 01:20:34.605
that are independent of scale.

01:20:34.605 --> 01:20:37.190
And we'll see lots more
about that on Friday.

01:20:37.190 --> 01:20:40.370
So you've got these fractal
systems all over the place,

01:20:40.370 --> 01:20:42.440
where the point over,
and over, and over again

01:20:42.440 --> 01:20:46.520
is the variability
isn't variability noise.

01:20:46.520 --> 01:20:49.130
It is what the
system is all about.

01:20:49.130 --> 01:20:52.650
There is no absolute state,
where the closer you get,

01:20:52.650 --> 01:20:56.150
the more it suddenly is going
to seem clean and nonvariable.

01:20:56.150 --> 01:20:58.800
An example of this,
an example of this

01:20:58.800 --> 01:21:02.584
in the biological literature.

01:21:02.584 --> 01:21:10.230
And this was actually a study
I did about 15 years ago,

01:21:10.230 --> 01:21:13.330
with probably the most obsessive
undergraduate I've met in all

01:21:13.330 --> 01:21:14.740
my years here at Stanford.

01:21:14.740 --> 01:21:17.240
Which was great, because
the study was only doable

01:21:17.240 --> 01:21:20.570
because he was
out-of-his-mind obsessive.

01:21:20.570 --> 01:21:22.540
Here's what the study was about.

01:21:22.540 --> 01:21:27.460
I was thinking about, well, all
of this chaos, fractal stuff,

01:21:27.460 --> 01:21:29.950
amid all of us functioning
with a standard model

01:21:29.950 --> 01:21:32.620
that, God, if only we
could measure this down

01:21:32.620 --> 01:21:34.371
to the single cell
level, then we'd really

01:21:34.371 --> 01:21:36.745
know what's happening, because
that's going to be so much

01:21:36.745 --> 01:21:39.069
better than blood values,
because that's noisy working.

01:21:39.069 --> 01:21:40.610
Working with that
model of the mirror

01:21:40.610 --> 01:21:44.260
reductive you get, the cleaner
the data are going to be.

01:21:44.260 --> 01:21:46.470
And then, here's this
whole other world

01:21:46.470 --> 01:21:48.660
of these non-linear
fractal systems saying,

01:21:48.660 --> 01:21:50.900
it shouldn't work that way.

01:21:50.900 --> 01:21:53.530
So it struck me to do the study.

01:21:53.530 --> 01:21:56.180
And what I wanted
to do was study

01:21:56.180 --> 01:22:00.210
the data generated in
the scientific literature

01:22:00.210 --> 01:22:03.140
at different scales
of reductionism

01:22:03.140 --> 01:22:06.030
and see what happens
to the variability.

01:22:06.030 --> 01:22:08.500
And the point here was to make
it as, like, well controlled

01:22:08.500 --> 01:22:09.565
as possible.

01:22:09.565 --> 01:22:13.742
I felt for some subject, that
was sort of Bio 150 related.

01:22:13.742 --> 01:22:15.450
And came up with the
notion that won't it

01:22:15.450 --> 01:22:19.290
be interesting to look at what
are the effects of testosterone

01:22:19.290 --> 01:22:21.080
on behavior?

01:22:21.080 --> 01:22:24.120
Just taking any such sort of
question out of this course,

01:22:24.120 --> 01:22:25.270
what are the effects?

01:22:25.270 --> 01:22:29.080
And you can answer that
on the level of societies.

01:22:29.080 --> 01:22:30.210
OK.

01:22:30.210 --> 01:22:32.729
People who are
agriculturalists tend

01:22:32.729 --> 01:22:34.270
to have different
testosterone levels

01:22:34.270 --> 01:22:35.510
than hunters, all of that.

01:22:35.510 --> 01:22:38.130
How does that affect
things like behavior?

01:22:38.130 --> 01:22:41.384
You can ask that on the
level of a single individual.

01:22:41.384 --> 01:22:43.050
What does a person's
testosterone levels

01:22:43.050 --> 01:22:44.510
tell you about behavior?

01:22:44.510 --> 01:22:47.610
You can ask on an
organ system level.

01:22:47.610 --> 01:22:49.600
What's happening
to blood pressure

01:22:49.600 --> 01:22:52.210
throughout the body
and cerebral oxygen

01:22:52.210 --> 01:22:54.230
delivery as a
functioning system,

01:22:54.230 --> 01:22:57.454
down to a single organ,
what's happening to the brain,

01:22:57.454 --> 01:22:58.870
down to a single
cell or molecule?

01:22:58.870 --> 01:23:02.070
All the way down, you
see the logic of it.

01:23:02.070 --> 01:23:05.000
So what we did-- and
I use "we" in the,

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:08.810
like, most parasitic way
possible-- what we did

01:23:08.810 --> 01:23:11.842
was to go to the literature,
the scientific literature.

01:23:11.842 --> 01:23:13.800
And for a reason, we
picked the literature, not

01:23:13.800 --> 01:23:16.900
a contemporary one at the time,
but one that was 10 years old.

01:23:16.900 --> 01:23:20.120
And we looked at every
journal out there

01:23:20.120 --> 01:23:21.890
that we could come
up with, that ever

01:23:21.890 --> 01:23:24.170
had papers in the
realm of-- that

01:23:24.170 --> 01:23:26.680
could be interpreted as
the effects of testosterone

01:23:26.680 --> 01:23:27.800
on behavior.

01:23:27.800 --> 01:23:30.150
Up from anthropology
journals, comparisons

01:23:30.150 --> 01:23:32.030
between different
groups; down to people

01:23:32.030 --> 01:23:36.550
doing X-ray crystallography
on testosterone receptors.

01:23:36.550 --> 01:23:38.960
And what this mad
man I had hanging out

01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:42.910
with me at that point did was
go through every single one

01:23:42.910 --> 01:23:44.630
of those papers.

01:23:44.630 --> 01:23:48.440
And first classify it, is
this an organismal one?

01:23:48.440 --> 01:23:50.000
Is this a multiorganismal one?

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.910
Is this a cellular, is this
a subcellular, all of that.

01:23:52.910 --> 01:23:57.800
And then measure how variable
were the data in that study.

01:23:57.800 --> 01:24:00.100
This was a drag.

01:24:00.100 --> 01:24:10.920
Because what he
had to do was-- OK.

01:24:10.920 --> 01:24:13.220
So there would be some figure
in one of these papers,

01:24:13.220 --> 01:24:14.290
looking like this.

01:24:14.290 --> 01:24:18.520
And what this tells you is, for
this group, here's the average.

01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:21.480
And this is a measure of how
much variability there was.

01:24:21.480 --> 01:24:23.210
And this tells you
there was a lot more

01:24:23.210 --> 01:24:25.794
variability in this measure
than this one, all of that.

01:24:25.794 --> 01:24:27.210
You could come up
with something--

01:24:27.210 --> 01:24:29.280
and do not worry about
the details here--

01:24:29.280 --> 01:24:32.170
something called a
coefficient of variation.

01:24:32.170 --> 01:24:36.330
Which is, you ask how
much variability is there

01:24:36.330 --> 01:24:39.050
relative to the
total size of this?

01:24:39.050 --> 01:24:43.550
And thus, what you will get
is, say, a circumstance,

01:24:43.550 --> 01:24:47.070
if this is 100 units
high; and in this case,

01:24:47.070 --> 01:24:48.920
this is 10 units high;
and in this case,

01:24:48.920 --> 01:24:50.560
this is 50 units high.

01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:54.670
In this case, your coefficient
of variation would be 50%.

01:24:54.670 --> 01:24:59.510
Your variance is half the size
of the thing you're studying.

01:24:59.510 --> 01:25:01.750
And in this case, the
coefficient of variation

01:25:01.750 --> 01:25:03.270
would only be 10%.

01:25:03.270 --> 01:25:05.860
It's much less noisy data.

01:25:05.860 --> 01:25:09.110
So what he did with
his little ruler

01:25:09.110 --> 01:25:12.080
there, in the next 3 and 1/2
years, with nothing else to do,

01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:14.520
he went through these
hundreds of papers.

01:25:14.520 --> 01:25:18.300
And for every single figure,
he measured what was the mean

01:25:18.300 --> 01:25:20.680
and what was the error bar
in every single figure.

01:25:20.680 --> 01:25:22.150
And, thus, what
was the coefficient

01:25:22.150 --> 01:25:26.800
of variation for that
piece of inflow of data,

01:25:26.800 --> 01:25:29.240
for that figure, for
that entire paper,

01:25:29.240 --> 01:25:31.660
that would have eleventy
different bars of data

01:25:31.660 --> 01:25:32.160
in there?

01:25:32.160 --> 01:25:34.520
And he's measuring away
and going mad from this.

01:25:34.520 --> 01:25:36.590
And eventually, what
he could then do

01:25:36.590 --> 01:25:40.390
was stick in the average
coefficient of variation

01:25:40.390 --> 01:25:44.210
in all of the papers in
the organismal category,

01:25:44.210 --> 01:25:46.795
and all the papers in
the cellular category,

01:25:46.795 --> 01:25:48.740
and all the way down.

01:25:48.740 --> 01:25:52.020
Reductive science,
what's the prediction?

01:25:52.020 --> 01:25:55.440
As we go from the big
organismal papers,

01:25:55.440 --> 01:25:59.410
all the way down to the
subcellular, submolecular ones,

01:25:59.410 --> 01:26:04.280
the noise, the variability,
the coefficient of variation

01:26:04.280 --> 01:26:08.570
should be decreasing as
you get more reductive.

01:26:08.570 --> 01:26:11.090
That would be the
traditional interpretation.

01:26:11.090 --> 01:26:14.200
The chaotic fractal
interpretation would be,

01:26:14.200 --> 01:26:15.580
it's not noise.

01:26:15.580 --> 01:26:18.860
It's not noise that you want to
get rid of with better tools.

01:26:18.860 --> 01:26:22.620
It is intrinsic--
I'm going to leave it

01:26:22.620 --> 01:26:26.210
there-- oscillatory stuff,
which is the system, rather

01:26:26.210 --> 01:26:28.290
than the discrepancy
from the system.

01:26:28.290 --> 01:26:31.550
It would predict that the
relative amount of noise,

01:26:31.550 --> 01:26:33.890
the variability, the
coefficient of variation,

01:26:33.890 --> 01:26:36.954
shouldn't be trending
towards decreasing.

01:26:36.954 --> 01:26:38.620
There shouldn't really
be a relationship

01:26:38.620 --> 01:26:42.160
between what level you
are examining phenomenon

01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:43.680
and the amount of variability.

01:26:43.680 --> 01:26:46.630
So an insane amount
of work later,

01:26:46.630 --> 01:26:50.530
this was his, like, what he
spent the early 1990s on,

01:26:50.530 --> 01:26:53.034
producing this one figure here.

01:26:53.034 --> 01:26:53.930
[LAUGHTER]

01:26:53.930 --> 01:26:54.880
This was it.

01:26:54.880 --> 01:26:55.480
This was it.

01:26:55.480 --> 01:26:59.620
He wept with pride and happiness
when we finally saw this,

01:26:59.620 --> 01:27:01.950
going from, this
is the coefficient

01:27:01.950 --> 01:27:05.490
of variation on all the data
in all the papers that year

01:27:05.490 --> 01:27:07.440
that were at the
organismal level,

01:27:07.440 --> 01:27:10.410
about an 18% coefficient
of variation.

01:27:10.410 --> 01:27:14.060
Organ system, single organ,
multicellular, single cell,

01:27:14.060 --> 01:27:18.420
subcellular, is there a trend
towards variability decreasing?

01:27:18.420 --> 01:27:19.700
Absolutely not.

01:27:19.700 --> 01:27:21.310
It's not going anywhere.

01:27:21.310 --> 01:27:23.220
It's remaining fairly constant.

01:27:23.220 --> 01:27:26.430
Looking over scales of
magnifications ranging

01:27:26.430 --> 01:27:29.530
from societies, down
to crystallography

01:27:29.530 --> 01:27:33.190
on single molecules, the
data don't get cleaner.

01:27:33.190 --> 01:27:34.930
They don't get less variable.

01:27:34.930 --> 01:27:37.730
Because it's a fractal system.

01:27:37.730 --> 01:27:40.370
One additional
possibility there was

01:27:40.370 --> 01:27:43.345
that part of what was
going in was you're

01:27:43.345 --> 01:27:46.674
looking at the entire
literature in that year.

01:27:46.674 --> 01:27:48.340
And as we all know,
some of those papers

01:27:48.340 --> 01:27:50.950
are going to be kind of garbage
and not very good science.

01:27:50.950 --> 01:27:52.740
Maybe that's the
noise in the system.

01:27:52.740 --> 01:27:55.400
And there's enough noise that
it swamps every single one

01:27:55.400 --> 01:27:56.280
of these levels.

01:27:56.280 --> 01:27:59.100
Here was the advantage that
we had been looking at papers

01:27:59.100 --> 01:28:00.880
published 10 years before.

01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:05.090
You could now see how many
times that paper was cited

01:28:05.090 --> 01:28:06.525
in the subsequent 10 years.

01:28:06.525 --> 01:28:08.670
In other words, you
could find the papers

01:28:08.670 --> 01:28:11.470
that were considered
by people in that field

01:28:11.470 --> 01:28:15.000
to be the really good ones,
versus the ones that were junk.

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:18.450
Now if we do the whole analysis
only on the papers that

01:28:18.450 --> 01:28:21.340
were in the top 10
percentile of influence,

01:28:21.340 --> 01:28:24.710
the best papers in the
field, and it winds up

01:28:24.710 --> 01:28:26.750
looking exactly like this.

01:28:26.750 --> 01:28:28.580
It's a fractal system.

01:28:28.580 --> 01:28:31.420
As you get closer and
closer to measuring

01:28:31.420 --> 01:28:33.700
what's really
happening, wow, down

01:28:33.700 --> 01:28:35.410
to the level of
single molecules,

01:28:35.410 --> 01:28:39.900
you don't get any cleaner data
because it's a fractal system.

01:28:39.900 --> 01:28:42.540
It's a chaotic fractal system.

01:28:42.540 --> 01:28:44.220
So that was real interesting.

01:28:44.220 --> 01:28:45.730
What was even more
interesting was

01:28:45.730 --> 01:28:48.730
after that, when we tried
to publish the paper.

01:28:48.730 --> 01:28:51.560
So got it together and
we wrote up this paper.

01:28:51.560 --> 01:28:55.370
And we sent it off to, like,
one of my favorite neuroscience

01:28:55.370 --> 01:28:56.100
journals.

01:28:56.100 --> 01:28:57.820
And after a couple
of weeks, the editor

01:28:57.820 --> 01:29:00.460
wrote back, saying this
is totally cool stuff.

01:29:00.460 --> 01:29:01.590
This is really interesting.

01:29:01.590 --> 01:29:03.540
This has really made
me rethink some stuff.

01:29:03.540 --> 01:29:05.321
This is very stimulating stuff.

01:29:05.321 --> 01:29:07.570
I don't see what it has to
do with our journal though.

01:29:07.570 --> 01:29:09.472
So we really can't publish it.

01:29:09.472 --> 01:29:11.930
So then I sent it off to my
favorite endocrinology journal.

01:29:11.930 --> 01:29:13.596
And two weeks later,
back comes a letter

01:29:13.596 --> 01:29:16.050
from the editor, saying,
whoa, totally cool stuff.

01:29:16.050 --> 01:29:18.549
Come over for dinner and bring
that piece of paper with you.

01:29:18.549 --> 01:29:21.000
But I don't quite see what
it has to do with our field.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:22.830
And marching our
way up and down,

01:29:22.830 --> 01:29:24.640
all the different
relevant journals

01:29:24.640 --> 01:29:26.880
in those different
disciplines, and each time

01:29:26.880 --> 01:29:29.260
they come back saying, whoa,
isn't that interesting.

01:29:29.260 --> 01:29:30.718
I can't wait to
tell my friend, who

01:29:30.718 --> 01:29:33.550
is the social anthropologist
or the x-ray crystallographer.

01:29:33.550 --> 01:29:36.960
But I don't see what it has to
do with our particular field

01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:37.530
here.

01:29:37.530 --> 01:29:40.240
And we couldn't get it
published in a journal that

01:29:40.240 --> 01:29:43.390
specialized in any single
one of these levels.

01:29:43.390 --> 01:29:45.690
So ultimately, we
published in this journal,

01:29:45.690 --> 01:29:49.000
this sort of philosophical
proceedings of medicine

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:49.640
and biology.

01:29:49.640 --> 01:29:53.120
As far as I can tell, I was
the first person under age 80

01:29:53.120 --> 01:29:54.971
to ever publish a
paper in that journal.

01:29:54.971 --> 01:29:55.470
[LAUGHTER]

01:29:55.470 --> 01:29:58.910
It's the journal of
somewhat demented, senile,

01:29:58.910 --> 01:30:01.110
elderly emeritus
professors, who were now

01:30:01.110 --> 01:30:03.730
writing their philosophical
pieces because they're not

01:30:03.730 --> 01:30:05.700
generating data any more.

01:30:05.700 --> 01:30:08.460
I broke the age barrier
on that journal.

01:30:08.460 --> 01:30:09.760
And they published in there.

01:30:09.760 --> 01:30:11.880
And in the years
since, it has had,

01:30:11.880 --> 01:30:15.870
like, zero impact on the
literature in terms of anybody

01:30:15.870 --> 01:30:18.340
quoting it, in terms
of anybody citing it.

01:30:18.340 --> 01:30:20.200
Actually that's not true.

01:30:20.200 --> 01:30:22.850
There's this
mathematician in Moscow.

01:30:22.850 --> 01:30:25.070
This guy started writing
to me about two months

01:30:25.070 --> 01:30:26.510
after the paper came out.

01:30:26.510 --> 01:30:29.610
And he basically said, this
was the most wonderful thing

01:30:29.610 --> 01:30:30.340
he had ever read.

01:30:30.340 --> 01:30:33.250
And I had transformed his
life, and he loved me.

01:30:33.250 --> 01:30:36.250
And he's been writing about
once every three weeks since.

01:30:36.250 --> 01:30:37.530
His English is not very good.

01:30:37.530 --> 01:30:40.620
Either he wants to adopt me
or he wants me to adopt him.

01:30:40.620 --> 01:30:41.890
I'm not quite sure in that.

01:30:41.890 --> 01:30:42.390
[LAUGHTER]

01:30:42.390 --> 01:30:45.220
But as far as saying,
that's like the only person

01:30:45.220 --> 01:30:47.490
who noticed that
it there, showing

01:30:47.490 --> 01:30:50.380
this point that this
is, but what does it

01:30:50.380 --> 01:30:52.100
have to do with our discipline?

01:30:52.100 --> 01:30:57.290
So what we see here is a prelude
to Friday, what fractals do

01:30:57.290 --> 01:31:00.230
is blow apart the notion
that get even more

01:31:00.230 --> 01:31:02.990
reductive than they
were back in the 1500s

01:31:02.990 --> 01:31:04.430
and we'll get better data.

01:31:04.430 --> 01:31:06.130
It doesn't get
better because it's

01:31:06.130 --> 01:31:07.940
the same degree of variability.

01:31:07.940 --> 01:31:13.820
Because the variability is
the-- whoa, where did that go?

01:31:13.820 --> 01:31:16.920
The variability is the
system, rather than

01:31:16.920 --> 01:31:18.880
discrepancy from the system.

01:31:18.880 --> 01:31:20.750
Fractals show that as well.

01:31:20.750 --> 01:31:22.650
What we'll begin
to see on Friday

01:31:22.650 --> 01:31:26.390
is how you can now
use fractal systems

01:31:26.390 --> 01:31:30.030
to solve some of those problems
of not enough neurons, not

01:31:30.030 --> 01:31:31.270
enough genes.

01:31:31.270 --> 01:31:32.060
OK.

01:31:32.060 --> 01:31:35.090
So on first past, what did
today seem to be about?

01:31:35.090 --> 01:31:38.200
This endless
trashing of reductive

01:31:38.200 --> 01:31:42.650
science and, you know, that's
how you fix a broken clock.

01:31:42.650 --> 01:31:44.600
But the world of really
interesting things

01:31:44.600 --> 01:31:48.690
are like broken clouds and are
non-linear aperiodic systems,

01:31:48.690 --> 01:31:51.190
that are just as interesting
and just as complex,

01:31:51.190 --> 01:31:53.000
no matter what scale
you look at them at.

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.940
Hooray, most of science
makes no sense whatsoever.

01:31:55.940 --> 01:31:58.590
Hooray for us, we
are the vanguard.

01:31:58.590 --> 01:31:59.240
OK.

01:31:59.240 --> 01:32:00.000
That's a drag.

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.330
Because that really doesn't
accomplish a whole lot

01:32:02.330 --> 01:32:05.650
because what there has
to be is a substitution.

01:32:05.650 --> 01:32:08.890
So where is the
actual predictability?

01:32:08.890 --> 01:32:11.230
Where is the actual
insight coming from?

01:32:11.230 --> 01:32:12.910
And that's what
Friday is about, which

01:32:12.910 --> 01:32:15.976
is this whole field of
complexity, emergence,

01:32:15.976 --> 01:32:17.630
what we'll look at there.

01:32:17.630 --> 01:32:20.907
But the last point here winds
up being, OK, OK, terrific.

01:32:20.907 --> 01:32:21.740
You've convinced me.

01:32:21.740 --> 01:32:25.790
You have trashed linear
additive periodic systems.

01:32:25.790 --> 01:32:28.190
And 500 years' worth
of books of science

01:32:28.190 --> 01:32:29.920
need to be burned at the stake.

01:32:29.920 --> 01:32:33.351
Is classical reductionism
good for anything?

01:32:33.351 --> 01:32:33.850
Yes.

01:32:33.850 --> 01:32:34.790
We already know it is.

01:32:34.790 --> 01:32:36.080
It's good for when
clocks are broken.

01:32:36.080 --> 01:32:36.740
No, no, no.

01:32:36.740 --> 01:32:39.760
I mean is it good for
anything in the realm of stuff

01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:43.740
that we're interested in,
in how, like, biology works,

01:32:43.740 --> 01:32:46.310
in how behavior
works, any of that?

01:32:46.310 --> 01:32:50.740
And what you get is, it's very
useful and very effective,

01:32:50.740 --> 01:32:55.070
if you're not very picky,
if you are not very precise.

01:32:55.070 --> 01:32:56.300
An example.

01:32:56.300 --> 01:32:58.260
There's a miserable
disease out there,

01:32:58.260 --> 01:33:00.530
that's wiping out
people left and right.

01:33:00.530 --> 01:33:02.800
And it's this viral disease.

01:33:02.800 --> 01:33:04.750
And you're trying to
figure out how to come up

01:33:04.750 --> 01:33:05.990
with a vaccine for it.

01:33:05.990 --> 01:33:08.070
And you finally come
up with a vaccine.

01:33:08.070 --> 01:33:10.010
And you start
distributing it to people.

01:33:10.010 --> 01:33:12.730
And what you see is exactly
what Jonas Salk saw,

01:33:12.730 --> 01:33:15.690
was that it did wonders
for preventing polio.

01:33:15.690 --> 01:33:20.100
But one in 560
kids, instead would

01:33:20.100 --> 01:33:22.740
get a worst case of polio.

01:33:22.740 --> 01:33:27.480
So you could now ask a
very reductive question,

01:33:27.480 --> 01:33:33.360
which is, is this vaccine,
what happened in that one kid?

01:33:33.360 --> 01:33:35.850
And what we'll see
at that level is

01:33:35.850 --> 01:33:38.560
if you're trying to ask
that, that's not going to be.

01:33:38.560 --> 01:33:40.584
If we understand what
happened in that one kid,

01:33:40.584 --> 01:33:43.000
we're going have to understand
their individual cells, all

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:44.958
the way down, to get
better and better numbers.

01:33:44.958 --> 01:33:46.860
Because this OK, we've
just entered the world

01:33:46.860 --> 01:33:49.430
where it's actually a
nonlinear chaotic system.

01:33:49.430 --> 01:33:52.690
Where's the reductionism useful?

01:33:52.690 --> 01:33:55.260
On the average, it's
a whole lot better

01:33:55.260 --> 01:33:59.070
that kids got this vaccine than
they didn't get the vaccine.

01:33:59.070 --> 01:34:03.240
You want reductive classical
dead-right male reproductive

01:34:03.240 --> 01:34:04.640
predictable science.

01:34:04.640 --> 01:34:06.775
It's if you have a
community of kids,

01:34:06.775 --> 01:34:09.570
who get injected with this,
versus a community that

01:34:09.570 --> 01:34:12.310
doesn't, they're
going to be healthier.

01:34:12.310 --> 01:34:14.660
Don't ask me about one
particular individual, let

01:34:14.660 --> 01:34:17.000
alone one particular
individual's immune system.

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:18.920
The reductionism
breaks down there.

01:34:18.920 --> 01:34:24.050
But if fancy, satisfying
science for you counts as,

01:34:24.050 --> 01:34:28.570
do they tend to be healthier
than them, reduction is great.

01:34:28.570 --> 01:34:30.540
That is sufficient.

01:34:30.540 --> 01:34:33.024
Suppose your question
is, well, is there

01:34:33.024 --> 01:34:34.440
a certain time of
the year, what's

01:34:34.440 --> 01:34:37.550
the weather likely going to
be in January versus in June?

01:34:37.550 --> 01:34:40.020
You're never going to
have reductive tools that

01:34:40.020 --> 01:34:43.300
can tell you on any particular
day what the temperature is

01:34:43.300 --> 01:34:45.670
going to be three
years from now.

01:34:45.670 --> 01:34:49.680
But if all you want to know is,
in general, it's warmer in June

01:34:49.680 --> 01:34:54.240
than in January, reductive tools
that exist now are sufficient.

01:34:54.240 --> 01:34:56.880
And when you look at what
people do in their research,

01:34:56.880 --> 01:34:59.880
in the labs and places
like this, in my lab,

01:34:59.880 --> 01:35:02.454
all of that, when you sit
there and you say, whoa,

01:35:02.454 --> 01:35:04.120
we just learned and
are trying to, like,

01:35:04.120 --> 01:35:06.070
figure out the cure
of some disease

01:35:06.070 --> 01:35:08.630
by finding the
mutation, whoa, that's

01:35:08.630 --> 01:35:09.930
really a reductive approach.

01:35:09.930 --> 01:35:11.795
And we just learned
that's gibberish.

01:35:11.795 --> 01:35:13.840
Whoa, everybody toss
out what they do.

01:35:13.840 --> 01:35:16.480
It's actually quite
useful because you're not

01:35:16.480 --> 01:35:18.940
very picky about what
you want out of it.

01:35:18.940 --> 01:35:20.730
My lab, for example,
studies what

01:35:20.730 --> 01:35:23.630
happens in brains after
there's a stroke and trying

01:35:23.630 --> 01:35:26.230
to figure out gene therapy
stuff that you can do.

01:35:26.230 --> 01:35:30.560
And we can't tell you
why one rat out of eight

01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:33.170
is not going to be
helped by this procedure.

01:35:33.170 --> 01:35:36.410
Whereas, three rats are
wonderful, and so on.

01:35:36.410 --> 01:35:36.950
Oh, I know.

01:35:36.950 --> 01:35:38.550
Let's look at their
are single molecules.

01:35:38.550 --> 01:35:39.633
That's not going to do it.

01:35:39.633 --> 01:35:40.940
Reductionism breaks apart.

01:35:40.940 --> 01:35:44.080
But it's perfectly fine at
the level that's useful here,

01:35:44.080 --> 01:35:46.629
which is, on the average,
is this something

01:35:46.629 --> 01:35:48.920
plausibly that you might want
to do to humans somewhere

01:35:48.920 --> 01:35:50.070
down the line?

01:35:50.070 --> 01:35:52.832
Most of what the science
research is about--

01:35:52.832 --> 01:35:54.540
and when you look at
the labs around here

01:35:54.540 --> 01:35:55.920
and you look at
the labs you work

01:35:55.920 --> 01:35:58.500
in, if those of you, who are
lots of you, do research,

01:35:58.500 --> 01:36:01.340
it's reductionism is
a perfectly good thing

01:36:01.340 --> 01:36:05.420
to use because you're not being
too picky what-- you do not

01:36:05.420 --> 01:36:07.640
want to come up with
an explanation for how

01:36:07.640 --> 01:36:12.070
every neuron in every
developing grasshopper on Earth

01:36:12.070 --> 01:36:12.790
bifurcates.

01:36:12.790 --> 01:36:15.380
At this point, you want to
know, in general, somewhere

01:36:15.380 --> 01:36:19.080
around hours three
to four after the egg

01:36:19.080 --> 01:36:22.390
starts or the grasshopper
parents meet and fall in love,

01:36:22.390 --> 01:36:25.230
or whatever it is,
that, in general, that's

01:36:25.230 --> 01:36:28.100
when you begin to get
differentiation here.

01:36:28.100 --> 01:36:29.600
Your science is great.

01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:31.930
So as long as most
of what we're asking

01:36:31.930 --> 01:36:34.770
is this sort of science,
where you just kind

01:36:34.770 --> 01:36:37.270
of a need to have a
general predictive sense,

01:36:37.270 --> 01:36:39.510
reductionism is just fine.

01:36:39.510 --> 01:36:42.600
But nonetheless, underneath
all of it, when you really

01:36:42.600 --> 01:36:46.820
want to understand the systems,
it's anything but reductionism.

01:36:46.820 --> 01:36:49.660
And probably the most
important philosophical point

01:36:49.660 --> 01:36:53.640
is when you look at these
interesting complex systems,

01:36:53.640 --> 01:36:56.420
there is not a "the answer."

01:36:56.420 --> 01:37:00.800
There is not a "the solution" to
what is this water wheel going

01:37:00.800 --> 01:37:01.770
to be doing?

01:37:01.770 --> 01:37:05.550
And thus, all of us, who
are out there, not quite

01:37:05.550 --> 01:37:07.700
matching the perfect
one, it is not

01:37:07.700 --> 01:37:11.960
that we are being deviating
from what the real answer, what

01:37:11.960 --> 01:37:14.230
the real norm is supposed to be.

01:37:14.230 --> 01:37:17.360
The variation is what
it's supposed to be.

01:37:17.360 --> 01:37:19.170
All of the things
that are interesting,

01:37:19.170 --> 01:37:21.700
when you measure them,
and they look like this,

01:37:21.700 --> 01:37:24.720
it's not because they
are failing to be what

01:37:24.720 --> 01:37:28.360
they're supposed to be and
match the norm, they're--

01:37:28.360 --> 01:37:31.760

Stanford University.

00:00:12.597 --> 00:00:15.940
OK, so we will pick up on
the one topic that was not

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.120
covered from two days ago
because you guys needed

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.520
to go play around with these
cellular automata first.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.120
So I will work
with the assumption

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.740
that everybody
here has now spent

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.380
48 hours playing with those.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.352
But presumably because
of the sleep deprivation,

00:00:31.352 --> 00:00:32.810
you've forgotten
much of it by now.

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:34.910
So we will cover some of it.

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:40.800
OK, back to that issue
of fractals and butterfly

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.210
effects and that whole
business that, by the time

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.340
you look at chaotic
systems that are

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.460
determinist but
aperiodical, that, when

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.030
they seem to be lines
crossing, getting back

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.660
into the same spot,
look closely enough

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.624
and they're not going
to actually be touching.

00:00:56.624 --> 00:00:59.200
And the centerpiece
of why that matters

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.920
was that whole
business of, these

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.190
both appear to be the same.

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:04.610
And take them out
a decimal place

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:05.901
and they're actually different.

00:01:05.901 --> 00:01:08.030
And a gazillion
decimal places out.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.840
And the entire sort of rationale
for thinking in that way

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.960
is the notion that a very
small difference here

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.560
can make a difference
one step to the left.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.380
And a million decimal places
out there, a small difference,

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.560
will make a difference
one before that.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.040
In a scale-free way, a fractal,
this here, a difference here,

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.950
a million decimal places
out is just as likely

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.710
to have consequences for
one over as this one for one

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.310
over fractal, scale
free, all of that.

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.150
But the critical thing
that is encompassed in this

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.400
is the notion that
tiny little differences

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.010
can have consequences
that magnify and magnify

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.080
and amplify into a
butterfly effect.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.020
So cellular automata
are a great way

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.870
of seeing this principle along
with a number of others that

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:03.330
are relevant to all of this.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.430
OK, so we start off
with the very first one.

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.410
And this is the one
that you no doubt first

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.530
discovered is a pattern,
which made you deeply happy.

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.490
And if you follow
the rules, it was

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.650
starting there-- was this--
which way is this facing,

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:18.610
starting at the bottom.

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.570
OK, this is starting
at the bottom.

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.540
And what you see is
these very simple rules.

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.290
And out of it emerges a
whole complex pattern.

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.600
And we'll be seeing
shortly the features

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.470
of this that perfectly match
what the requirements are

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.540
for emergent complexity.

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.230
But we'll see as the elements
are lots of constituents,

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.850
lots of building blocks.

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.370
The building blocks
being very simple.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.230
They're binary.

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.330
Either they are
filled or not filled.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.420
Extremely simple rules as to
how the next generation gets

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.250
formed.

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.680
And in terms of the extremely
simple rules, none of the rules

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.980
have anything to do with other
than the next generation.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.370
It is all local rules built
around what the neighborhood is

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:14.810
like for each one of these.

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.530
So you put it
together, and out come

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.960
these very structured
patterns like these.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.470
And this is great.

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.070
This is very exciting.

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:25.350
Except this isn't
what you usually get.

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.180
In most of these cellular
automata systems, where

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.160
you start off with an initial
condition and a simple set

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.470
of local neighbor rules for
how you get reproduction

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.500
into the next
generations, in most cases

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.190
the patterns stop after a while.

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.420
In the vast majority,
they stop, they

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.868
hit a wall, they go extinct.

00:03:45.868 --> 00:03:47.540
Aha.

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:48.980
Two terms that
I've already stuck

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.510
in here that are
biological metaphors

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.420
start to seem less
metaphorical after a while.

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.250
First off, the notion that
going from here to here to here

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.880
to here represents
each next generation.

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.900
And the notion that,
as we were just now,

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.990
that the vast majority of
these cellular automata systems

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:09.150
go extinct.

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.150
They fail after a while.

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.210
So it's a very small subset.

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:16.220
What you then also
see is-- in some ways

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.300
the critical point in
this whole business--

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:22.680
is the relatively small
number of starting states

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.410
that succeed produce a
remarkably small number

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:32.940
of mature states that all look
very similar to each other.

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.390
In other words, you can
start with a whole bunch

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:40.010
of different conditions,
and you will wind up

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:44.040
with a bunch of smaller number
of stereotypical patterns.

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.150
Half of the cellular
automata that

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.100
wind up taking
off look something

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:49.810
like this with this pattern.

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:51.120
What are we seeing?

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.670
Convergence.

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:53.770
Convergence.

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:58.190
The notion that you can start
with different forms and they

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:00.040
will converge over time.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.710
What's this?

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.080
Well, you just proved you
look at the mature form

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.330
and you can't know
the starting state.

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:10.110
The other thing is, starting
at the beginning just looking

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.520
at this line,
there is no way you

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.260
can tell what it's going to look
like 20 generations from now.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.310
You've got to march through it.

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:20.840
In other words,
the starting state

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.070
gives you no predictive
power about the mature state.

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:26.490
This is a nonlinear system.

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.090
The cellular
automata encapsulates

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:33.000
this, this business that
most of these go extinct.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.610
Only a relatively few number
of mature forms exist.

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:38.420
It shows convergence.

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:40.660
Very different starting
states can converge

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:42.340
into the same sort of patterns.

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:46.060
And minor differences
in the starting state

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:50.530
can extend into very
different consequences.

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:53.400
It shows, in other
words, butterfly effects.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.570
OK, so appreciating this a bit.

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:58.650
So what we did was then
go to example number

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.010
two, where we changed
the starting state

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:02.030
just a little bit here.

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:03.790
We shifted around
some of the boxes.

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:06.570
And what you see is something
that looks roughly the same,

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:07.980
but it's not exactly the same.

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:10.310
But it's the same
general feel to it.

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:11.910
So that's great.

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:15.430
But then we started an
exercise of starting off

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:18.870
with the initial boxes.

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:19.880
This goes that way.

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:24.210
The initial boxes evenly spaced
with one space between them

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:26.120
and applied the
rules from there.

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.540
And this is what you get.

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:32.100
Totally boring, static,
inorganic, inanimate.

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.290
This is what it does
for the rest of time.

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:37.110
What this exercise then
did, going to number four,

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:40.170
is what if we now
spaced two boxes

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:41.810
between each one of these?

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:44.970
And here we have an extinction.

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:46.970
This is one of those
where it hits a wall,

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:49.980
and all the next
lines are empty.

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:53.730
OK, how about three boxes in
between the starting states?

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:56.530
OK, another form of extinction.

00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:59.990
OK, how about four boxes
between the starting states?

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:03.810
And suddenly, something
very dynamic takes off.

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:06.540
Applying the same rules,
and all you've done

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:09.420
is change the spacing
between the starting states.

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:13.830
And look at, for one thing, how
close this was to going extinct

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:17.140
up there on top, how
asymmetrical the pattern is

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:18.100
that comes out.

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:21.792
And this particular one will
stay asymmetrical forever.

00:07:21.792 --> 00:07:24.140
And the ways in
which that generated

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:26.070
something very unexpected.

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:29.040
There is no way you
could sit there a priori

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:33.400
and say, hm, one box in between
generates something that

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:34.350
looks inanimate.

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:35.910
Two boxes, not going to work.

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:36.790
Three boxes, yeah.

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:38.960
Somewhere around four
boxes in between.

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:41.900
That's when dynamic
systems suddenly take off.

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:44.180
There is no way
to have known that

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:47.600
before without marching through
this and actually seeing.

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:51.920
Starting state tells you
nothing about the mature state.

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:54.610
Then we space it even further.

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:58.080
And what we get is
something similar again.

00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:59.270
This one is symmetrical.

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:01.340
It is somewhat different
from the previous one,

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:03.430
but it's the same
sorts of patterns

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:05.390
that come up over and over.

00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:08.400
So what we've seen here
is, by starting state,

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:11.310
minor differences,
big divergence

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:15.600
between going extinct versus
being a viable pattern.

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:18.390
Minor differences in starting
state, big divergence

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:21.110
between symmetrical and
asymmetrical patterns.

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:24.800
Tiny differences,
butterfly effects.

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:26.680
OK, next.

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:35.539
Looking at the consequences here
of introducing some asymmetry

00:08:35.539 --> 00:08:36.539
from the very beginning.

00:08:36.539 --> 00:08:42.020
The one on the left up on top
has four boxes and four boxes.

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:43.289
It has eight boxes.

00:08:43.289 --> 00:08:46.620
The one on top has eight boxes
on the left, and the one on top

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:49.660
on the right, just adding in
one extra box on the side,

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:50.910
so it's four and five.

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:53.690
Adding a little asymmetry,
and what you see

00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:55.950
is a very different pattern.

00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:57.690
And one of the things
you tend to see

00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:03.020
in these pseudo-animate living
pattern systems is starting

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:06.850
states of asymmetry produce
more dynamic systems,

00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:10.930
more dynamic patterns than
even symmetrical ones.

00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:14.320
That's one of the only rules
that comes out of there.

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:17.940
So we're seeing now minor
little differences producing

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:20.400
major different consequences.

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:23.780
Divergencies, butterfly effects.

00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:27.945
Now showing this
in a different way.

00:09:27.945 --> 00:09:34.520
And what we've got here are
four different starting state

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:35.720
conditions.

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:37.220
The one on the far
left is, in fact,

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:39.380
the one from the previous
one, the four and four.

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:41.430
Four different starting
state conditions

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:44.504
where they're not enormously
related to each other.

00:09:44.504 --> 00:09:46.920
The first one against the other
three, but the other three

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.230
have minor differences.

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:50.210
And the whole thing
is, two of these

00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:54.040
are identical after the
first 20 generations or so.

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:57.170
This one and this one.

00:09:57.170 --> 00:09:59.830
The two of them are
identical, and for the rest

00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:01.880
of the universe
they will produce

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:03.600
the same identical pattern.

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:07.780
And looking at the mature
state, you show up on the scene

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:11.570
somewhere halfway down, and
you could never ever know

00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:13.210
what the starting state was.

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:16.550
Did it start like this or
did it start like this?

00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:18.680
A convergency here.

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:21.044
And in this case, it's
another one of those rules.

00:10:21.044 --> 00:10:22.710
Knowing the starting
state doesn't allow

00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:24.230
you to predict the mature form.

00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:27.090
Knowing the mature
form, you don't

00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:30.080
know which particular starting
state brought it about.

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:31.790
And the only way
to figure it out

00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:35.030
is to stepwise go
through the whole process

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:39.040
because you can't just
iterate by a blueprint.

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:39.960
There is no blueprint.

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:44.250
Finally, the last
one was giving you,

00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:46.330
instead of different
starting boxes

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:49.420
in each case with the
same reproduction rule,

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:51.610
the last one was the
same starting pattern

00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:54.340
of boxes with
different, slightly

00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:56.160
different, reproductive rules.

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:59.950
And what you see here are
totally different outcomes,

00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:01.430
depending on which variant.

00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:04.000
We have the beloved
one on the top left.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000
And you see here, by slightly
changing the nearest neighbor

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.560
rules, if and only
if there is one

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:12.390
neighbor with this
property, if and only

00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:13.980
if there's two neighbors.

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:15.600
And working through
that way, and you

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:20.350
see remarkably divergent
outcomes for one thing.

00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:22.060
You see that the
majority of them

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:25.770
produce something very
boring, either boring extinct

00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:29.750
or boring repetitive in
a very undynamic way.

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:35.150
Only a small subset
produce lively, animated,

00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:36.652
living systems.

00:11:36.652 --> 00:11:38.860
So we're seeing a whole
bunch of biological metaphors

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:41.857
here over and over and over,
which is the starting states.

00:11:41.857 --> 00:11:43.440
You don't know the
mature, the mature,

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:44.856
you don't know the
starting state.

00:11:44.856 --> 00:11:48.630
The generations, very simple
rules for generations,

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:50.240
going one to the next.

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:52.610
What we see also is
the vast majority

00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:56.540
go extinct and produce,
either go extinct

00:11:56.540 --> 00:12:00.950
or some repetitive, very boring,
crystallized type structure.

00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:03.580
A small subset, a
tiny subset, produce,

00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:05.460
instead, dynamic patterns.

00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:09.000
And knowing what the
starting state is is not

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.140
going to give you any
predictability whatsoever of,

00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:14.740
is this going to produce
a dynamic pattern or not?

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:17.620
Nor does it allow you to look at
a bunch of the starting states

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:20.420
and say, those two
are going to produce

00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:22.680
the same mature pattern.

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:25.820
And these are all
properties of the evolution

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:28.000
of different living systems.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.110
So you begin to see,
OK, cellular automata.

00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:32.620
Do you see some of
these principles?

00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:36.470
The simplest level out
there in the natural world

00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:41.481
is looking at all sorts of
shells, seashells and tortoise

00:12:41.481 --> 00:12:43.870
shells by the seashore
and whatevers.

00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:47.980
And they all have
patterning on them

00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:53.410
that is derived from that
first cellular automata

00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:57.610
rule, producing patterns that
look a whole lot like these.

00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:01.750
And go online and look for them
because I didn't get around

00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:05.400
to it in time, but producing
all sorts of patterns in nature.

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:07.070
Very common ones.

00:13:07.070 --> 00:13:08.420
What does that tell you?

00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:13.420
Very simple rules for generating
the same complex patterns

00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:16.560
and different starting
states, cellular automata

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:19.110
and properties here.

00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:21.850
Another thing in a
living biological system

00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:23.910
that begins to suggest this.

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:28.859
OK, so I do this
research in East Africa.

00:13:28.859 --> 00:13:30.400
And every now and
then over the years

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:32.860
I've gone to this mountain
called Mount Kenya, which

00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:34.250
is on the equator.

00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:36.140
It's about 17,000 feet.

00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:37.770
It's got glaciers up on top.

00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:40.530
So this is an equatorial
glacial mountain.

00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:43.570
And you go up to about
the 15,000-foot zone,

00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:46.910
and there's like--
it's more land.

00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:49.030
Almost everything is dead
up there from the cold.

00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:50.500
And there's
basically only, like,

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:53.580
four or five different
types of plants up there.

00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:57.610
Oh, already a very small
number that survive

00:13:57.610 --> 00:13:58.780
in that environment.

00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:01.820
And each one of them is
very bizarre and distinctive

00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:02.400
looking.

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:03.858
There's one of them
that looks like

00:14:03.858 --> 00:14:06.680
a little, like, rosebud
thing, except it's

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:08.580
about 5 feet across.

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:10.220
And then there's
another one that

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:12.350
has sort of a sprouty
thing like this and then

00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:15.670
a big central cactus-looking
thing that isn't really cactus.

00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:18.240
So there's a few of
these really distinctive,

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:20.060
bizarre-looking plants.

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:22.350
And in some way or
other, that's what

00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:24.650
it takes to survive up there.

00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:28.640
So I have this friend who
does research up in the Andes.

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:30.540
And he does botany
stuff up there.

00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:35.100
And he goes into this one range
there that is on the equator

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:37.410
and high enough that
there's glaciers up there.

00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:40.600
Ah, a glacial equatorial
mountain on the other side

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:41.370
of the globe.

00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:43.110
So one day I'm sitting
around and looking

00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:44.650
at some of his pictures there.

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:48.900
And suddenly I look and say,
that's the exact same plant.

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:52.310
That's the big rosebud plant
that is in Mount Kenya.

00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:54.990
And oh, my god, that's
the tall sprouty one.

00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:56.770
And say, it's the
exact same plant.

00:14:56.770 --> 00:14:58.650
How can that plant
be over there?

00:14:58.650 --> 00:15:02.720
And we go rummage around in
his botany taxonomy stuff,

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:06.090
and they are completely
unrelated plants.

00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:10.120
They are taxonomically of
no connection whatsoever.

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:15.380
But what they've done is
converged onto the same shape.

00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:18.030
And in some mysterious
way, if you're

00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:21.600
going to be a plant growing
on the equator at about

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:25.330
15,000 feet, there's only about
four or five different ways

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:26.460
of appearing.

00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:28.650
There is massive convergence.

00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:30.690
And there's only
four or five ways

00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:33.580
that you can survive an
environment like that.

00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:37.600
You get organisms in
very dry environments,

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:40.570
and there's, like,
only four or five ways

00:15:40.570 --> 00:15:43.080
that you can go about being
an organism that's super

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:45.070
efficient at retaining water.

00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:48.770
And those are the only
ones you see amongst them.

00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:51.970
Desert animals, and
completely unrelated ones,

00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:54.770
have converged onto some
of the same solutions.

00:15:54.770 --> 00:15:56.800
There's only a
very finite number

00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:00.010
of ways to do legs
and locomotion.

00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:04.140
Two is good, four, weirdo
things that fly of six,

00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:05.270
creepy things have eight.

00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:06.860
You don't find seven.

00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:08.200
You don't find three.

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:11.530
You find some of the solutions
here are immensely different

00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:13.690
starting states
and have converged.

00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:17.400
What we see is in these living
systems over and over stuff

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:19.740
that look like
cellular automata,

00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:25.240
where slight differences magnify
enormously butterfly effects,

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:28.930
where you are modeling living
systems in a very real way.

00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:30.540
Most of them go extinct.

00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:32.130
Divergence, convergence.

00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:35.460
And where each one of these
you get the smaller number,

00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:38.890
reflecting the fact that there's
only a limited number of ways

00:16:38.890 --> 00:16:42.850
of doing rain forest,
temperate zone rain forest

00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:44.240
in the Pacific Northwest.

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:46.290
There's only a
limited number of ways

00:16:46.290 --> 00:16:48.920
of doing tundra in Miami Beach.

00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:50.660
There's only a limited
number of ways.

00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:53.080
In all of these,
this convergence,

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:56.800
and always reflecting that
these are cellular automata.

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:57.440
OK.

00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:02.970
So hopefully you are now
feeling desperately regretful

00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:05.480
that you didn't spend the
last few days doing this

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:07.890
because these are
so heartwarming.

00:17:07.890 --> 00:17:10.650
If you want to read a book
that nobody in their right mind

00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:14.550
should read, it's a book by this
guy named Steve Wolfram, who's

00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:19.200
one of the gods of
computers and math

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:21.750
and was one of the sort of
people who first developed

00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:23.829
cellular automata.

00:17:23.829 --> 00:17:26.800
And by all reports
probably one of the largest

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:28.550
egos on the planet.

00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:30.730
And he published a
book, self-published it,

00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:32.580
a few years ago, which
he can because he

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:36.030
is grotesquely wealthy, from
some of his computer programs.

00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:39.500
And just showing what a
low-key sort of humble guy

00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:43.110
he is, he called the book
A New Kind of Science,

00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:46.040
just showing that
he wasn't just going

00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:48.830
from some little piddly new
way of viewing the world,

00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:51.580
but here was his
new type of science.

00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:53.990
And the book is
about 1,200 pages.

00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:55.750
And I suspect not
even his mother

00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:58.580
has read the thing it
is so impenetrable.

00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:00.790
And it sold a gazillion copies.

00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:03.450
And almost all of them are
sitting in people's garages

00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:06.500
now, weighting down drain pipes
because no one can actually

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:07.390
read this thing.

00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:09.830
But an awful lot of
what the book is about

00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:15.710
are patterns in nature coded
for by very simple local rules.

00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:17.560
And the simple fact
of that, you've

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:21.480
got a lot of very smart people
doing this cellular automata

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:22.360
stuff.

00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:24.880
And they can't
come up with rules

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:28.570
where you could look at
something beforehand a priori

00:18:28.570 --> 00:18:31.150
and know this one
is going to survive,

00:18:31.150 --> 00:18:33.390
this one is going to
go extinct, those two

00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:35.270
are going to turn
the same, these two

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:37.360
that differ by a
slight smidgen are

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:39.360
going to turn out to be
enormously different.

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:41.170
There's no rules for it.

00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:43.250
And the book has all
sorts of cool pictures

00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:45.885
of a cellular automata
looking things out in nature.

00:18:45.885 --> 00:18:50.386
And go buy it for
somebody's birthday

00:18:50.386 --> 00:18:52.885
and see if they're not grateful
for the rest of their lives.

00:18:52.885 --> 00:18:55.580
But his whole argument
there is, these

00:18:55.580 --> 00:19:00.080
show ways in which you can code
for a lot of the complexity

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:05.050
in the natural world with
small numbers of simple rules.

00:19:05.050 --> 00:19:08.020
This whole business
of emergence.

00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:09.920
This sets us up
now for beginning

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:11.720
to look at some of
the ways in which we

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:15.180
hit a wall the other day, ways
in which the reductive model

00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:18.190
of understanding the universe
stops working after a while.

00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:20.700
One version being the
problem of not having

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:22.660
enough numbers of things.

00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:25.450
Not having enough
neurons to do grandmother

00:19:25.450 --> 00:19:28.460
neurons beyond Jennifer
Aniston, that whole business

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:30.260
that you simply
don't have enough

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:33.660
neurons to do that beyond just
the rare ones now and then.

00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:35.280
And what do you get instead?

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:37.580
What has the solution
turned out to be?

00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:40.905
This field that people focus
on now called neural networks.

00:19:43.565 --> 00:19:48.400
And the point of neural networks
is that information, again,

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:51.460
is not coded in a single
molecule, single synapse,

00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:53.272
single neuron, one neuron.

00:19:53.272 --> 00:19:55.230
This neuron knows one
thing and one thing only,

00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:57.480
which is when there's
a dot there, instead,

00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:00.150
information is
coded in networks,

00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:03.520
in patterns of
neural activation.

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:05.730
And just to give you
an example, and this is

00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:06.980
one that's in the Zebra book.

00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:09.130
And anyone who is in
Biocore I do this one,

00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:11.710
and I do it because
I at one point

00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:13.960
learned the name of three
impressionist painters,

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:15.240
except they're not
coming to mind right now.

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:16.760
OK, so you've got two layers.

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:18.800
Here's what a neural
network would look like.

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:20.410
A two-layer one.

00:20:20.410 --> 00:20:25.000
These neurons on the bottom
are boring, simple, Hubel and

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.260
Wiesel-type neurons
from the other day,

00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:30.540
where each neuron knows one
thing and one thing only.

00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:34.660
This one knows how to
recognize Gauguin paintings,

00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:38.797
this one recognizes Van
Gogh, and this one Monet.

00:20:38.797 --> 00:20:40.050
OK.

00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:43.090
Each one of them is-- obviously
there is no Hubel and Wiesel

00:20:43.090 --> 00:20:44.870
neuron on Earth
that's like that.

00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:46.410
But just for our purposes.

00:20:46.410 --> 00:20:48.390
They now project up
to this next layer.

00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:52.520
Note this neuron projects
to one, two, and three.

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:54.660
This to two, three, and four.

00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:56.180
This to three, four, and five.

00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:58.800
So what does this
neuron know about?

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:01.160
This one knows how
to recognize Gauguin.

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:04.200
It's only getting
information from this neuron.

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:06.780
It's another one of those
Hubel and Wiesel type,

00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:08.910
I know one fact
and one fact only.

00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:11.840
This one here is
another one of those.

00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:14.830
What does this neuron
know about in the middle?

00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:17.400
That's the neuron that
knows how to recognize

00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:19.220
Impressionist paintings.

00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:21.780
That's the one that
says, I can't tell you

00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:25.150
who the artist is, but it's
one of those Impressionists.

00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:27.230
It's not one of
those Dutch masters.

00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:29.490
It's an Impressionist painting.

00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:33.460
And this one does it because
it is getting information that

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:35.780
is not available to these guys.

00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:39.270
It is getting information
at the intersection

00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:42.100
of all these specific examples.

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:45.150
These ones, number
two and four, those

00:21:45.150 --> 00:21:47.920
are ones that recognize
Impressionist paintings also,

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:50.800
but they're not as accurate
at it as number three

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:53.960
because they've got less
examples to work off of.

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:56.040
This is how a
network would work.

00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:58.890
And what that suddenly
begins to explain

00:21:58.890 --> 00:22:02.800
is something about the human
brain versus a computer.

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:06.840
Computers are amazing at doing
sequential analytical stuff.

00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:10.730
Like, you get calculator
things inside Cheerio boxes

00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:12.860
that can do more things
than the human brain can

00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:14.600
do computationally.

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:17.890
But what we can do is
parallel processing.

00:22:17.890 --> 00:22:22.940
What we can do is patterns,
resemblances, similarities,

00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:26.300
metaphorical similarities,
physical similarities.

00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:29.450
And that's why you need
networks like these.

00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:33.130
You don't need neurons that
know one fact and one fact only.

00:22:33.130 --> 00:22:35.570
You need neurons
where each one of them

00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:38.760
is at the intersection of a
whole bunch of other inputs.

00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:40.270
OK, example.

00:22:40.270 --> 00:22:42.260
So now suppose
you've got a network.

00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:44.590
There's one neuron
which fires, and there's

00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:47.960
a whole bunch of neurons sort
of sending projections into it.

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:51.090
And this is a neuron
for remembering

00:22:51.090 --> 00:22:52.680
the name of that guy.

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:54.020
What was the name of that guy?

00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:56.350
That guy, he was that
Impressionist painter.

00:22:56.350 --> 00:22:58.630
So suddenly your
Impressionist painter network

00:22:58.630 --> 00:23:01.110
is activating and
firing at this neuron.

00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:04.120
So it's sitting there.

00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:08.060
So this is-- now you've got
your whole Impressionist network

00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:08.820
that's activated.

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:10.700
What was the name of that guy?

00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:12.850
He was an Impressionist painter.

00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:16.770
He painted women dancers
a lot of the time.

00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:19.260
So people who painted dancers.

00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:20.640
But it wasn't Degas.

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:23.870
OK, so your "it's not Degas"
circuit going in there.

00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:25.110
And what was that guy's name?

00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:27.240
God, I had that seventh
grade art teacher

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:28.440
who loved this guy's work.

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:31.090
If I could remember her name,
I would remember his name.

00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:33.502
Oh, remember the time
I was at the museum

00:23:33.502 --> 00:23:35.960
and there was that really cute
person who seemed to like it

00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:37.942
and I had to pretend
I liked this guy also

00:23:37.942 --> 00:23:39.400
and it didn't work
out nonetheless?

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:40.160
And going through.

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:41.470
And oh, what's the name?

00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:44.440
There's that stupid pun about
the guy, he's really short.

00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:46.980
And something about the
tracks being too loose.

00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:48.590
Ah, Toulous-Lautrec.

00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:51.520
And suddenly it pops
out there, and you've

00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:54.120
got enough of these
inputs coming in there.

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:57.360
And this is tip of
the tongue wiring.

00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:00.450
This is how you may not
be able to just remember

00:24:00.450 --> 00:24:01.750
the guy's name.

00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:04.500
Wait, he was the short guy
with a beard who hung out

00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:06.730
in bars and Parisian bars.

00:24:06.730 --> 00:24:09.590
And here was that
time in seventh grade.

00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:12.640
And enough of these inputs,
and suddenly out pops

00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:14.040
the information.

00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:16.170
And what this begins
to tell you is,

00:24:16.170 --> 00:24:19.150
this is ways of
getting similarities.

00:24:19.150 --> 00:24:22.370
These are ways of getting
things that vaguely remind you.

00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:25.440
This is a world where
humans can now do stuff

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:27.920
like have a piece of
music that reminds

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:30.280
them of a certain
artist because they

00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:32.810
both have similar coloration.

00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:35.430
And that's something
that makes sense to us.

00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:37.640
That's something that can
work because, what you then

00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:41.370
begin to see is, every one
of these neurons, this one,

00:24:41.370 --> 00:24:43.900
for example,
Impressionist neurons.

00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:47.690
This one may also be at the
intersection of another network

00:24:47.690 --> 00:24:51.980
that's going this way,
a network of French guys

00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:53.460
from the last century.

00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:57.260
And it may be part of
another network of people

00:24:57.260 --> 00:24:58.909
whose names are
hard to pronounce

00:24:58.909 --> 00:25:00.950
so you're anxious about
saying them in a lecture.

00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:03.221
Or the intersection--
and each one of these

00:25:03.221 --> 00:25:05.596
is going to be an intersection
of a whole bunch of these.

00:25:05.596 --> 00:25:08.310
All of these networks,
what does that do?

00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:11.020
That's what you can do
that a computer can't.

00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:14.900
You see similarities,
similes, metaphors.

00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:17.950
And somewhere in there you get
something really important,

00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:23.790
which is the ones, the networks,
that have wider expanses that

00:25:23.790 --> 00:25:26.300
connect to a broader
number of neurons

00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:30.570
in a very simple,
artificial, idiotic way.

00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:33.710
That's kind of what
creativity would have to be,

00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:36.790
networks that are
spreading far wider

00:25:36.790 --> 00:25:39.530
than in some other individual.

00:25:39.530 --> 00:25:42.410
It is literally
making connections

00:25:42.410 --> 00:25:44.950
that neurons in another
individual does not.

00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:48.810
And suddenly you have
a world where everyone

00:25:48.810 --> 00:25:51.220
knows this one is a face.

00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:54.930
And it was only a limited
number of people who ever

00:25:54.930 --> 00:25:56.820
decided that this one's a face.

00:25:56.820 --> 00:26:00.910
And in some level Picasso had
a different network, a broader

00:26:00.910 --> 00:26:04.240
one, as to what could
constitute a face.

00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:07.030
A broader network
in some way is going

00:26:07.030 --> 00:26:11.030
to have to be wiring
that is more divergent.

00:26:11.030 --> 00:26:14.260
And at the intersection
of a bunch of networks

00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:16.412
that are acting in
a convergent way.

00:26:16.412 --> 00:26:18.370
So what's some of the
evidence that it actually

00:26:18.370 --> 00:26:19.850
does work this way?

00:26:19.850 --> 00:26:25.240
You go and you stick electrodes
into neurons in the cortex,

00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:28.960
and what you see, if the
world was entirely made up of,

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:32.650
like Hubel and Wiesel, one
piece of knowledge only, what

00:26:32.650 --> 00:26:35.700
you would see is you would find
neurons that each one responds

00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:37.400
to one single thing.

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:38.900
All these grandmother neurons.

00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:40.830
And instead, what
you see by the time

00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:44.080
you get to the interesting
part of the cortex

00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:47.339
past the first three
layers of the visual cortex

00:26:47.339 --> 00:26:49.130
and the first three
layers of the auditory.

00:26:49.130 --> 00:26:52.180
Once you get into
the 90% that's called

00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:53.895
the associational
cortex-- and it's

00:26:53.895 --> 00:26:55.270
called that because
nobody really

00:26:55.270 --> 00:26:57.910
knows what it does--
then what you see

00:26:57.910 --> 00:27:01.590
are neurons that are
multimodal in their responses.

00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:04.480
All sorts of things
stimulate them.

00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:06.720
And here we have a neuron
that's being stimulated

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:10.470
by a type of painting, by
the knowledge of French guys,

00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:13.160
by something phonetic,
by all sorts--

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:15.330
and they're multiresponsive.

00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:17.350
So that's what you
wind up seeing.

00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:19.530
The majority of
cortical neurons,

00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:21.530
when you record from
them with an electrode,

00:27:21.530 --> 00:27:23.020
they're not grandmother neurons.

00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:25.490
They're at the intersection
of a bunch of nets.

00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:27.140
More evidence for this.

00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:30.390
This was-- one of the grand
poobahs of neuroscience

00:27:30.390 --> 00:27:33.320
around the 1940s or so,
a guy named Karl Lashley.

00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:35.810
And obviously a
very different time

00:27:35.810 --> 00:27:37.900
in terms of thinking about
specification of brain

00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:38.670
function.

00:27:38.670 --> 00:27:42.470
And what he did was a
very systematic attempt

00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:44.930
to be able to show
where in the brain

00:27:44.930 --> 00:27:47.110
individual facts were stored.

00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:50.570
And the term for it at the time,
this jargony term, was engrams.

00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:54.390
He was searching for the
engram for different facts.

00:27:54.390 --> 00:27:56.180
And what he would
show was, he would

00:27:56.180 --> 00:27:59.930
destroy parts of the cortex
in an experimental animal.

00:27:59.930 --> 00:28:02.980
And he couldn't make the
information disappear.

00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:05.220
He would have to
destroy broader areas.

00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:07.150
And some of the knowledge,
some of the memory

00:28:07.150 --> 00:28:08.410
was still in there.

00:28:08.410 --> 00:28:10.630
And he concluded in
this famous paper

00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:12.736
in the search for the
engram that, according

00:28:12.736 --> 00:28:14.110
to all the science
he knew, there

00:28:14.110 --> 00:28:16.370
could be no such
thing as memory.

00:28:16.370 --> 00:28:18.760
And the reason why
was he was working

00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:21.220
with a model of being
able to-- there's

00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:23.860
a single neuron where,
if I could ablate it,

00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:26.200
I should be able to
now show in that rat

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:29.540
that it's just lost the name
of its kindergarten teacher.

00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:33.190
And instead, you see
networks going on.

00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:35.630
You see the same thing
clinically in something

00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:38.190
like people with
Alzheimer's disease.

00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:43.450
Early on in Alzheimer's, you
will lose, in these networks,

00:28:43.450 --> 00:28:46.750
you'll lose a neuron here or
you'll lose a neuron there

00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:48.650
when you're just
beginning to lose neurons.

00:28:48.650 --> 00:28:50.500
And what you see is,
clinically, in people

00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:55.130
with Alzheimer's, early on, it's
not that they forget things.

00:28:55.130 --> 00:28:57.410
It's not that memory is gone.

00:28:57.410 --> 00:28:59.540
It's just harder to get to.

00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:01.820
And you do this with
all sorts of testing,

00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:03.610
neuropsychological
testing, where

00:29:03.610 --> 00:29:07.690
you try to give the person
cues to pull it out.

00:29:07.690 --> 00:29:08.352
Example.

00:29:08.352 --> 00:29:10.560
You're giving somebody,
potentially with Alzheimer's,

00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:12.810
a classic orientation test.

00:29:12.810 --> 00:29:17.320
You ask them, OK, do you know
the name of the president?

00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:18.750
OK, they manage to get that.

00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:20.770
Do you know the name
of the last president?

00:29:20.770 --> 00:29:22.019
No idea.

00:29:22.019 --> 00:29:23.810
So now you give them
a little bit of cuing.

00:29:23.810 --> 00:29:25.184
OK, let me help
you a little bit.

00:29:25.184 --> 00:29:27.320
It's a one-syllable word.

00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:29.150
Still not there, even
though you've now

00:29:29.150 --> 00:29:33.260
activated the one-syllable word
network, obviously artificial.

00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:33.960
Still can't say.

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:35.790
OK, let's make it a
little bit easier.

00:29:35.790 --> 00:29:39.970
It's things you could find
in a park, in a city park.

00:29:39.970 --> 00:29:41.240
So you're activating that.

00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:42.890
No, still not coming out.

00:29:42.890 --> 00:29:45.750
And then you give even more
explicit priming there.

00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:48.450
You give them a forced choice
paradigm, is what it's called.

00:29:48.450 --> 00:29:51.750
OK, so is it President Tree or
President Shrub or President

00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:53.260
Bench or President Bush?

00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:56.000
Bush, Bush, the kid
with the father also.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.600
It's still in there.

00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:58.960
It was still in there.

00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:01.800
It just takes more
work to pull it out.

00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:04.630
What you're seeing
there is not the death

00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:06.780
of individual memories.

00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:10.920
You're seeing a weakening
of a network, a network that

00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:15.280
is now taking stronger priming
to pull it out of there.

00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:18.940
And just to show how subtle
network stuff can be,

00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:21.680
here's something that would
work with a lot of individuals

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:23.290
with early stage dementias.

00:30:23.290 --> 00:30:25.890
What you do is another
type of priming.

00:30:25.890 --> 00:30:27.484
So you're eventually
going to ask

00:30:27.484 --> 00:30:29.150
them the name of the
previous president.

00:30:29.150 --> 00:30:32.300
And they first come in and
you say, oh, great to see you.

00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:32.816
Come on in.

00:30:32.816 --> 00:30:33.690
What a beautiful day.

00:30:33.690 --> 00:30:35.190
I walked here by
way of the park.

00:30:35.190 --> 00:30:37.694
The bushes were so beautiful
this morning in the park.

00:30:37.694 --> 00:30:39.610
Some of them had flowers,
some of them didn't.

00:30:39.610 --> 00:30:41.480
But bushes are so nice
to look at when you're

00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:42.860
walking through a
park because bushes

00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:44.693
are one of my favorite
forms of [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:44.693 --> 00:30:46.500
And then five
minutes later, they

00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:49.880
are more likely to
remember the name Bush

00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:53.290
out of a whole different realm
of more subtle networks you're

00:30:53.290 --> 00:30:54.590
tapping into.

00:30:54.590 --> 00:30:56.920
So all of this is the
beginning of a way

00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:59.960
of solving the problem we
had the other day of not

00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:03.740
enough neurons for them
to be grandmother neurons.

00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:05.160
More solutions.

00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:07.190
We then went to our
next realm of trouble,

00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:10.310
which was the problem of,
there's not enough genes.

00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:12.940
There's not enough genes
in that specific realm

00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:15.730
of explaining bifurcations.

00:31:15.730 --> 00:31:20.150
And there can't be a gene
that specifies, OK, this

00:31:20.150 --> 00:31:22.780
is where you bifurcate if you
were this particular blood

00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:25.730
vessel and a different gene
for this particular bronchial

00:31:25.730 --> 00:31:27.530
and a different
gene for this branch

00:31:27.530 --> 00:31:30.320
of a dendrite and a single--
it can't work that way.

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:31.920
There are not enough genes.

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:34.650
What this introduces
is the idea of there

00:31:34.650 --> 00:31:40.450
being fractal genes,
genes whose instructions

00:31:40.450 --> 00:31:44.000
are ones that are scale free.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:45.660
What do I mean by this?

00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:47.970
OK, here's what a
fractal gene might do.

00:31:47.970 --> 00:31:49.430
So we've got a tube.

00:31:49.430 --> 00:31:52.440
And this is a tube that's going
to be part of a blood vessel

00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:55.470
or a dendrite or a
lung or whatever.

00:31:55.470 --> 00:31:56.670
We've got a tube.

00:31:56.670 --> 00:32:02.660
And the fractal rule here is,
grow this tube in distance,

00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:07.465
grow it until it is five
times longer than it is wide.

00:32:07.465 --> 00:32:10.710
The width, the opening,
and that's the simple rule.

00:32:10.710 --> 00:32:16.075
And the rule is, when it's grown
five times longer, bifurcate.

00:32:16.075 --> 00:32:17.700
So what's going to
happen at that point

00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:19.380
is just gone five times longer.

00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:21.890
And it bifurcates at that point.

00:32:21.890 --> 00:32:25.270
And what you've got is now,
because this is split in two,

00:32:25.270 --> 00:32:27.660
the cross-section is
going to be shorter.

00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:29.560
But you apply the same rule.

00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:31.960
Now with the shorter
cross-section,

00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:32.940
you have the same rule.

00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:35.840
Grow five times the length
of that cross-section

00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:37.200
until you split.

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:39.510
And what you wind
up getting is, this

00:32:39.510 --> 00:32:43.430
is one simple fractal rule
that will generate the tree

00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:44.250
patterns.

00:32:44.250 --> 00:32:46.790
That the branchings get
shorter and shorter,

00:32:46.790 --> 00:32:48.610
the distances between
the branch points

00:32:48.610 --> 00:32:51.070
get shorter and shorter
because the cross-sections are

00:32:51.070 --> 00:32:54.300
getting-- one simple rule
and you could generate

00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:56.860
a circulatory system,
a pulmonary system,

00:32:56.860 --> 00:33:01.090
and a dendritic tree by
giving a fractal instruction,

00:33:01.090 --> 00:33:04.110
in this case, one
that is scale free.

00:33:04.110 --> 00:33:06.980
That is, independent of
what the unit is here.

00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:09.080
And this could work
within the single neuron

00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:12.710
or within an entire
circulatory system.

00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:13.810
So all of that's great.

00:33:13.810 --> 00:33:15.670
That's totally hypothetical.

00:33:15.670 --> 00:33:17.375
Ooh, fractal genes.

00:33:17.375 --> 00:33:19.250
Well, you know by now
that's got to translate

00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:21.440
into a protein in
some way or other.

00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:26.370
How might this actually
look in a real system?

00:33:26.370 --> 00:33:35.350
So suppose-- OK, so a
gene coding for a protein.

00:33:35.350 --> 00:33:37.674
This is one copy of the
protein, this is another,

00:33:37.674 --> 00:33:38.340
this is another.

00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:41.930
They bind to each other in a
way so that they form a tube.

00:33:41.930 --> 00:33:43.870
And they bind to
each other in a way

00:33:43.870 --> 00:33:47.570
that's just pure mechanical
reality of, these are not

00:33:47.570 --> 00:33:50.470
bits of information,
these are actual proteins.

00:33:50.470 --> 00:33:52.090
So it's going up
in the tube there.

00:33:52.090 --> 00:33:55.450
And suppose that the forces
are, as the tube goes up

00:33:55.450 --> 00:33:57.220
it gets more and more unstable.

00:33:57.220 --> 00:33:59.180
And when the tube
is high enough,

00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:02.610
it gets unstable
enough that these bonds

00:34:02.610 --> 00:34:06.980
between the proteins begin to
weaken, and it begins to split.

00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:09.010
The splitting
there is a function

00:34:09.010 --> 00:34:10.480
of the length of these.

00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:11.429
So it's split.

00:34:11.429 --> 00:34:13.830
And now the next one
has half the number

00:34:13.830 --> 00:34:17.679
of proteins in this one, and
thus it's that much weaker.

00:34:17.679 --> 00:34:20.360
So you only have to go
a shorter distance now

00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:22.234
before it begins to split.

00:34:22.234 --> 00:34:23.425
This doesn't exist.

00:34:23.425 --> 00:34:25.090
It is no way it's like this.

00:34:25.090 --> 00:34:27.110
But what you could
begin to see is,

00:34:27.110 --> 00:34:31.150
here's how you could turn a
scale-free set of instructions

00:34:31.150 --> 00:34:33.010
potentially into what
it would actually

00:34:33.010 --> 00:34:36.590
look like with mortar and
bricks in terms of proteins.

00:34:36.590 --> 00:34:38.402
How it might actually work.

00:34:38.402 --> 00:34:42.860
Now the notion of fractal
genetics, of fractal genes,

00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:46.620
and fractal instructions begins
to solve another problem,

00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:50.170
and this is that space problem
of how much stuff can you

00:34:50.170 --> 00:34:52.260
jam into a space.

00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:57.290
Here's the challenge here in
terms of how dense things are.

00:34:57.290 --> 00:35:00.970
In the body-- amazing factoid--
there is no cell in your body

00:35:00.970 --> 00:35:05.520
that is more than five cells
away from a blood vessel.

00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:07.910
OK, you could see why you
would want to do that.

00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:10.602
But that is not an
easy thing to pull off.

00:35:10.602 --> 00:35:12.560
How do you do that with
the circulatory system?

00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:14.870
And amazing other
factoid to factor in

00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:20.610
with that is, the circulatory
system comprises less than 5%

00:35:20.610 --> 00:35:22.580
of your body mass.

00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:24.250
How can this be?

00:35:24.250 --> 00:35:29.030
You've got this system
that's everywhere.

00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:31.370
But it's taking up
almost no space.

00:35:31.370 --> 00:35:34.450
It's within five cells
of every cell out there,

00:35:34.450 --> 00:35:36.770
yet it's less than
5% of the body.

00:35:36.770 --> 00:35:38.242
And, OK, forget it.

00:35:38.242 --> 00:35:39.450
I'm not going to put that up.

00:35:39.450 --> 00:35:44.260
But what this begins to--
OK, you convinced me.

00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:45.080
So let's do this.

00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:52.030
So what you begin
to do is transition

00:35:52.030 --> 00:35:56.000
to a world of fractal geometry.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:01.820
You've got all your Euclidean
world of nice, smiley, strange

00:36:01.820 --> 00:36:02.640
things there.

00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:07.110
You've got this
whole world of shapes

00:36:07.110 --> 00:36:11.020
that are constrained by classic
Cartesian geometry and all

00:36:11.020 --> 00:36:11.540
of that.

00:36:11.540 --> 00:36:15.230
And what fractal geometry
generates are objects that

00:36:15.230 --> 00:36:17.400
simply cannot exist.

00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:19.500
Here up on top,
eventually, you will

00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:21.100
see the first example of this.

00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:22.760
And this is out
of the Chaos book.

00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:25.280
And this is this cantor set.

00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:28.060
What you do is you
start with a line.

00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:31.470
Start with a line, and you
cut out the middle third.

00:36:31.470 --> 00:36:33.330
Now for those
remaining two ones,

00:36:33.330 --> 00:36:34.810
you cut out the middle third.

00:36:34.810 --> 00:36:37.614
For those remaining four,
you cut out the middle third.

00:36:37.614 --> 00:36:39.020
And there it is.

00:36:39.020 --> 00:36:41.790
And you just keep doing this
over and over and over again.

00:36:41.790 --> 00:36:44.940
And what do you do when you
take it out to infinity?

00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:46.660
What have you generated?

00:36:46.660 --> 00:36:51.460
A set of an infinitely
large number of objects,

00:36:51.460 --> 00:36:54.520
lines, that take up an
infinitely small amount

00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:55.560
of space.

00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:58.370
It's not possible for
that to work, yet,

00:36:58.370 --> 00:37:00.140
as you go more and
more in that direction,

00:37:00.140 --> 00:37:03.060
you get this
impossible phenomenon

00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:06.560
of something approaching having
an infinite number of places

00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:09.970
that something appears while
taking up almost an infinitely

00:37:09.970 --> 00:37:11.870
small amount of space.

00:37:11.870 --> 00:37:16.640
And what this winds up being is,
it's not quite a line anymore

00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:19.430
at the bottom, but it's
kind of more than a dot.

00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:22.640
It's somewhere between
one and two dimensions.

00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:24.160
It's a fractal.

00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:26.700
Its dimensional
state is somewhere

00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:28.570
one point something or other.

00:37:28.570 --> 00:37:31.440
It is somewhere between
dots and a line,

00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:33.620
and it does this
impossible thing,

00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:38.135
which is it's everywhere
without taking up any space.

00:37:38.135 --> 00:37:41.080
Or you could then push
it to the same thing

00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:42.430
in the next dimension.

00:37:42.430 --> 00:37:44.460
And this is this Koch snowflake.

00:37:44.460 --> 00:37:46.060
And it's the same sort of rule.

00:37:46.060 --> 00:37:48.830
You start with the
triangle there.

00:37:48.830 --> 00:37:52.010
And the rule is, you
take the middle third

00:37:52.010 --> 00:37:54.490
and you put a little
triangle out of it.

00:37:54.490 --> 00:37:56.150
And then take the
middle third of that

00:37:56.150 --> 00:37:57.589
and put a little triangle out.

00:37:57.589 --> 00:37:58.380
And a middle third.

00:37:58.380 --> 00:38:00.588
And you just keep doing it
forever and ever and ever.

00:38:00.588 --> 00:38:03.640
And you wind up with
something that is impossible,

00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:08.970
which is an object that has an
infinite amount of perimeter,

00:38:08.970 --> 00:38:13.670
an infinite amount of surface
area, within a finite space.

00:38:13.670 --> 00:38:15.070
That's impossible.

00:38:15.070 --> 00:38:17.240
But it begins to approach this.

00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:19.080
And what you see
here, this is a way

00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:21.600
of just iterating over
and over and over to jam

00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:25.860
a huge amount of surface
area into a tiny space.

00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:30.290
And thus it's somewhere but
different, sort of like a line,

00:38:30.290 --> 00:38:32.580
but it's sort of
like a plane by then.

00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:34.960
And it's got a
fractal form somewhere

00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:36.730
between two and three.

00:38:36.730 --> 00:38:40.240
It's got a fractal quality of
two point something or other.

00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:43.320
It's an impossible
object that is solving

00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:46.110
this problem of being--
in another version,

00:38:46.110 --> 00:38:50.910
having surface area everywhere
without taking up any space

00:38:50.910 --> 00:38:53.060
and being within a finite area.

00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:55.210
Next, finally,
this Menger sponge,

00:38:55.210 --> 00:38:56.990
which is the same exact concept.

00:38:56.990 --> 00:39:00.620
Again, you start with the
box up there, or the ring,

00:39:00.620 --> 00:39:03.100
and you take out
the middle third

00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:04.357
of each of those segments.

00:39:04.357 --> 00:39:05.940
And then you take
out the middle third

00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:07.130
of each of those segments.

00:39:07.130 --> 00:39:09.150
And if you are doing
this with what starts off

00:39:09.150 --> 00:39:12.160
as a three-dimensional cube,
eventually you get something

00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:17.690
that cannot exist, which is an
object that has an infinitely

00:39:17.690 --> 00:39:22.260
large amount of surface
area while having no volume.

00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:24.870
That's what it produces
at the extreme.

00:39:24.870 --> 00:39:27.980
And we got something here
that's somewhere between two

00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:30.480
different dimensions,
a fractal again.

00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:34.490
And what you see is, this is
how the body solves the packing

00:39:34.490 --> 00:39:35.310
problem.

00:39:35.310 --> 00:39:41.960
Because all you need to do is
make the circulatory system,

00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:44.530
the circulatory system
some version of this,

00:39:44.530 --> 00:39:47.120
some version of splitting
the ends of the capillaries

00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:50.740
over and over and over or making
the lungs, with their surface

00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:54.820
area for exchanging oxygen,
looking something like this.

00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:57.200
And this is how you
generate a system that

00:39:57.200 --> 00:40:00.490
is everywhere and taking
up virtually no space.

00:40:00.490 --> 00:40:02.640
Obviously, it's not
taken out to infinity.

00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:05.340
But this is how you can have
a circulatory system that's

00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:07.580
five cells away from
every cell in the body,

00:40:07.580 --> 00:40:11.000
yet takes up less
than 5% of the body.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:13.570
This is a fractal solution.

00:40:13.570 --> 00:40:15.970
All you do here
to generate these

00:40:15.970 --> 00:40:17.620
is taking some of
these qualities

00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:19.350
over and over and
over and over, and you

00:40:19.350 --> 00:40:23.840
can begin to produce absolutely
bizarre, impossible things

00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:27.530
in terms of surface area
and perimeter and volume

00:40:27.530 --> 00:40:28.540
and all of that.

00:40:28.540 --> 00:40:31.060
This is how you can
use a fractal system

00:40:31.060 --> 00:40:33.362
to solve the packing problem.

00:40:33.362 --> 00:40:35.390
Now of course, as soon
as you're coming up

00:40:35.390 --> 00:40:38.370
with the notion of something
like fractal genes,

00:40:38.370 --> 00:40:42.730
you, of course, have to consider
the possibility of there

00:40:42.730 --> 00:40:44.830
being fractal mutations.

00:40:44.830 --> 00:40:47.580
What would a fractal
mutation look like?

00:40:47.580 --> 00:40:50.040
And again, most people,
most geneticists

00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:51.670
and molecular
people, do not think

00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:53.040
about this in these terms.

00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:56.050
But there are people who do
who actually talk about things

00:40:56.050 --> 00:40:57.950
like fractal gene mutations.

00:40:57.950 --> 00:40:59.320
What would it look like?

00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:03.840
Suppose you've got a mutation,
and it produces a protein

00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:05.870
that's slightly different.

00:41:05.870 --> 00:41:08.900
And as a result,
its got bonds here

00:41:08.900 --> 00:41:13.000
that are slightly weaker
between different proteins.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.540
So on a mechanical level,
what have we just defined?

00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:18.970
This is a tube that's going
to grow these proteins where

00:41:18.970 --> 00:41:22.220
it's a shorter distance
before it begins to split.

00:41:22.220 --> 00:41:25.010
Because these bonds between
them are not as strong.

00:41:25.010 --> 00:41:27.170
There is a mutation
now where, instead

00:41:27.170 --> 00:41:30.590
of growing five times
the cross-section, maybe

00:41:30.590 --> 00:41:34.010
you're growing 4.9
times the cross-section.

00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:37.660
And thanks to that mutation,
the entire branching system

00:41:37.660 --> 00:41:39.590
is going to be compacted a bit.

00:41:39.590 --> 00:41:42.570
It's not going to
reach the target cells.

00:41:42.570 --> 00:41:46.140
And these would be
catastrophic mutations where

00:41:46.140 --> 00:41:47.830
the pulmonary system
doesn't develop,

00:41:47.830 --> 00:41:50.040
the circulatory system
doesn't develop.

00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:52.620
And what you would
see in those cases is,

00:41:52.620 --> 00:41:55.260
the mutation is something
that has consequences

00:41:55.260 --> 00:41:57.000
that are scale free.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:00.650
Another hint when you see some
fractal gene mutations are

00:42:00.650 --> 00:42:03.350
a small number of
diseases that they're

00:42:03.350 --> 00:42:06.950
about spatial
relationships in the body.

00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:10.090
For example, there's a disease
called Kallmann syndrome, where

00:42:10.090 --> 00:42:14.990
you get stuff that's wrong with
midline structures in the body.

00:42:14.990 --> 00:42:16.730
Something is wrong
with the septum

00:42:16.730 --> 00:42:19.650
between the nose, the nostrils.

00:42:19.650 --> 00:42:21.810
Something is wrong
in the hypothalamus.

00:42:21.810 --> 00:42:24.780
Something is wrong in
the septum of the heart.

00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:26.760
This is not three
different mutations.

00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:29.910
This is some sort of
fractal mutation messing up

00:42:29.910 --> 00:42:33.840
how that embryo did
symmetry, how the embryo does

00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:35.380
midline structures.

00:42:35.380 --> 00:42:37.290
So you begin to see
ways here in which

00:42:37.290 --> 00:42:40.930
you can solve this and, within
the biological metaphor,

00:42:40.930 --> 00:42:44.580
where you could begin to get
solutions for these problems

00:42:44.580 --> 00:42:47.300
and also mutations that
can put you up the creek.

00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:48.070
OK.

00:42:48.070 --> 00:42:51.010
So that is another realm
for beginning to solve this.

00:42:51.010 --> 00:42:52.400
Another domain.

00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:55.850
And here we begin to move
into the realm of emergence,

00:42:55.850 --> 00:42:57.640
emergent complexity.

00:42:57.640 --> 00:43:01.390
Which we will first look at a
couple of crude passes at it.

00:43:01.390 --> 00:43:05.390
First, emergence driven
by biophysical properties.

00:43:05.390 --> 00:43:07.190
And do not freak
out if you don't

00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:09.860
know what I mean because I have
no idea what I mean by that.

00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:12.420
So I will explain in
a more accessible way.

00:43:12.420 --> 00:43:15.720
And this was something that
was explained endlessly

00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:17.330
by a guy who used
to be in the bio

00:43:17.330 --> 00:43:21.010
department, a developmental
botanist named Paul Green, who

00:43:21.010 --> 00:43:23.890
died about 10 years ago
way too young from cancer.

00:43:23.890 --> 00:43:25.570
He was a really good guy.

00:43:25.570 --> 00:43:28.290
He would give this
famous lecture

00:43:28.290 --> 00:43:30.830
where he would start
off and he would

00:43:30.830 --> 00:43:33.170
describe some sort of disk.

00:43:33.170 --> 00:43:36.830
And the point is that the
disk, the material inside

00:43:36.830 --> 00:43:41.610
was of a softer material than
the material on the perimeter.

00:43:41.610 --> 00:43:43.440
And he'd be putting
up math at this point

00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:44.720
that I didn't understand.

00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:46.450
But it was sort of
a disk like that.

00:43:46.450 --> 00:43:51.740
And then he would show that what
happens if you heat the system.

00:43:51.740 --> 00:43:54.274
What happens if you put
heat on a disk like this?

00:43:54.274 --> 00:43:55.690
And what he would
wind up showing,

00:43:55.690 --> 00:43:58.570
going through agonizing
amounts of math,

00:43:58.570 --> 00:44:01.990
is that, when you heat a
system, the only solution

00:44:01.990 --> 00:44:04.450
for this system that's
trying to respond to the heat

00:44:04.450 --> 00:44:07.450
but in different ways on the
perimeter versus the inside

00:44:07.450 --> 00:44:11.910
is to come up with a double
saddle, a double saddle shape.

00:44:11.910 --> 00:44:13.181
And the math proved this.

00:44:13.181 --> 00:44:15.680
And I had no idea what he was
talking about when you come up

00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:18.050
with a double saddle shape.

00:44:18.050 --> 00:44:20.550
And then what he says
is, so that's how

00:44:20.550 --> 00:44:23.410
you get a potato chip.

00:44:23.410 --> 00:44:25.410
You take a slice
of potato, where

00:44:25.410 --> 00:44:27.520
there is more resistance
on the perimeter

00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:29.640
and less on the inside,
and you heat it.

00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:31.770
And the only solution
to the problem

00:44:31.770 --> 00:44:35.510
is to come up with a double
saddle potato chip shape.

00:44:35.510 --> 00:44:38.350
And if you change the
outside, the force of it,

00:44:38.350 --> 00:44:40.530
if you take one of
those great organic,

00:44:40.530 --> 00:44:42.550
"give you the runs"
type potato chips,

00:44:42.550 --> 00:44:45.540
where it's going to have the
skin left on the outside,

00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:48.520
it's going to be a somewhat
different-shaped double saddle.

00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:51.130
Because there's
only one solution

00:44:51.130 --> 00:44:52.920
mathematically to that.

00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:54.580
And then you sit
there, and you deal

00:44:54.580 --> 00:44:56.080
with a very simple,
important fact,

00:44:56.080 --> 00:45:00.460
which is, that slice of
potato knows no biophysics.

00:45:00.460 --> 00:45:02.010
That slice of potato didn't fit.

00:45:02.010 --> 00:45:05.200
There's no gene that
instructs potatoes

00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:07.040
to respond to heat in this way.

00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:11.100
This was the inevitable outcome
of the biophysical properties

00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:12.930
of a slice of potato.

00:45:12.930 --> 00:45:15.810
And what he then shows
is, in plant systems

00:45:15.810 --> 00:45:17.860
after plant systems,
they develop

00:45:17.860 --> 00:45:20.000
where two shoots
come out this way

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:21.470
and a little higher
up two shoots

00:45:21.470 --> 00:45:23.540
this way and two this
way and two this way.

00:45:23.540 --> 00:45:25.360
They're all double saddles.

00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:28.300
And this winds up being
a mathematical solution

00:45:28.300 --> 00:45:29.980
to a packing problem there.

00:45:29.980 --> 00:45:32.230
When plants are
growing their stems,

00:45:32.230 --> 00:45:35.000
there is no gene specifying it.

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.140
You don't need
genetic instructions.

00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:41.060
It is an emergent property
of the physical constraints

00:45:41.060 --> 00:45:43.160
of the system.

00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:47.600
Another example here that's
sort of proto-emergent, somewhat

00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:49.620
simpler versions,
this phenomenon

00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:51.280
of wisdom of the crowd.

00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:53.070
And this is one that
was first identified

00:45:53.070 --> 00:45:56.700
by Francis Galton, who was
some relative of Darwin

00:45:56.700 --> 00:46:00.000
and started eugenics and
was bad news in that regard

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:01.570
but famous statistician.

00:46:01.570 --> 00:46:04.580
And being an Englishman
somewhere in the 19th century,

00:46:04.580 --> 00:46:08.310
he spent huge amounts of time
going to state fairs and county

00:46:08.310 --> 00:46:09.210
fairs or whatever.

00:46:09.210 --> 00:46:11.130
And he was at this
fair one day where

00:46:11.130 --> 00:46:14.120
they had some oxen up there.

00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:16.890
And they were having a contest
that, if you could guess

00:46:16.890 --> 00:46:19.480
the exact weight of
the oxen, you would

00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:21.289
get to milk it or something.

00:46:21.289 --> 00:46:22.830
I don't know what
the prize would be.

00:46:22.830 --> 00:46:24.550
And there were
hundreds of farmers

00:46:24.550 --> 00:46:26.409
around filling out
little pieces of paper

00:46:26.409 --> 00:46:27.450
where they were guessing.

00:46:27.450 --> 00:46:28.970
And what he
discovered at the end

00:46:28.970 --> 00:46:31.670
was that nobody got
the answer right.

00:46:31.670 --> 00:46:32.180
Good.

00:46:32.180 --> 00:46:34.260
So the owners of
this get off easy

00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:36.360
without having to give up
any of their oxen milk.

00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:38.900
But he then did
something interesting.

00:46:38.900 --> 00:46:41.980
He collected all the
little slips of paper,

00:46:41.980 --> 00:46:43.990
and he averaged all of them.

00:46:43.990 --> 00:46:47.780
And it came out to the correct
weight within an ounce.

00:46:47.780 --> 00:46:51.210
In other words, no
individual in that group

00:46:51.210 --> 00:46:54.640
had enough knowledge to be
able to truly accurately tell

00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:55.790
what this thing was.

00:46:55.790 --> 00:46:57.980
But put them
together in a crowd,

00:46:57.980 --> 00:47:00.970
and out comes the right answer.

00:47:00.970 --> 00:47:02.350
Another version of this.

00:47:02.350 --> 00:47:05.250
And this one is deeply
important in terms

00:47:05.250 --> 00:47:07.230
of Western
intellectual tradition.

00:47:07.230 --> 00:47:10.120
Back to-- is that program Who
Wants to Marry a Millionaire?,

00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:11.701
does that still exist?

00:47:11.701 --> 00:47:12.200
[INAUDIBLE]

00:47:13.090 --> 00:47:14.425
In reruns?

00:47:14.425 --> 00:47:18.780
In-- OK, so it was this one.

00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:21.110
They give you questions,
and if you answer them

00:47:21.110 --> 00:47:22.964
they give you money
and it's great.

00:47:22.964 --> 00:47:25.630
And at various points, if you're
stumped you've got three things

00:47:25.630 --> 00:47:26.171
you could do.

00:47:26.171 --> 00:47:29.047
One is, they could eliminate--
you've got four choices.

00:47:29.047 --> 00:47:30.630
They can eliminate
two of them to make

00:47:30.630 --> 00:47:32.200
it a little bit easier for you.

00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:35.490
Another is, you have this
expert who you can call up.

00:47:35.490 --> 00:47:38.760
And the third option is
to ask the audience what

00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:40.144
they think is the right answer.

00:47:40.144 --> 00:47:42.310
And all the audience there
has these little buttons,

00:47:42.310 --> 00:47:45.880
so they can choose A, B, C, or
D of the multiple choice there.

00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:49.870
And what the logic is supposed
to be is, cut it down to two.

00:47:49.870 --> 00:47:51.880
Your chances are better
if you have to guess.

00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:55.061
Talk to your wise expert, who's
sitting by on the phone there.

00:47:55.061 --> 00:47:57.560
And they're going to be wise
and be able to hopefully answer

00:47:57.560 --> 00:47:58.160
this question.

00:47:58.160 --> 00:48:00.840
Or ask a whole bunch of people.

00:48:00.840 --> 00:48:02.150
And they would all vote.

00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:04.900
And any smart
contestant would choose

00:48:04.900 --> 00:48:06.770
whatever the audience chose.

00:48:06.770 --> 00:48:11.840
Because, when the audience
was asked, 91% of the time

00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:13.740
they got the right answer.

00:48:13.740 --> 00:48:17.190
They got the majority of people
voting for the right answer.

00:48:17.190 --> 00:48:20.030
And this is more
wisdom of the crowd.

00:48:20.030 --> 00:48:22.430
And this was a much
better hit rate

00:48:22.430 --> 00:48:25.420
than whoever the expert was on
the other side of the phone.

00:48:25.420 --> 00:48:28.250
One person could be
extremely expert,

00:48:28.250 --> 00:48:30.200
but they're not
going to be as expert

00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:35.250
as a whole bunch of somewhat
decent experts thrown together.

00:48:35.250 --> 00:48:38.610
This is the notion behind a
field called prediction markets

00:48:38.610 --> 00:48:43.340
where what you do is you are
trying to predict some event.

00:48:43.340 --> 00:48:45.220
For example, the
Pentagon is very

00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:47.250
interested in using
prediction markets

00:48:47.250 --> 00:48:51.440
to try to predict where the
next terrorist attack might be.

00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:54.130
And what you do is you get
a whole bunch of experts,

00:48:54.130 --> 00:48:56.130
and you ask each of them
to think about whatever

00:48:56.130 --> 00:49:00.260
the parameters are and take a
guess as to how long it will

00:49:00.260 --> 00:49:02.290
be before the next one occurs.

00:49:02.290 --> 00:49:04.320
And what you do is,
you average them up

00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:06.930
and assume there is a wisdom
of the crowd thing going on.

00:49:06.930 --> 00:49:09.660
And that will give you
lots of information.

00:49:09.660 --> 00:49:11.720
Great case of this
a few years ago.

00:49:11.720 --> 00:49:14.920
There was some
submarine or something

00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:17.850
that sunk somewhere out in
the Pacific, in the ocean.

00:49:17.850 --> 00:49:20.210
And nobody knew where
it was, but they kind of

00:49:20.210 --> 00:49:22.280
knew where the last
sighting, the last recording,

00:49:22.280 --> 00:49:23.160
was from it.

00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:25.840
But they had a whole
bunch of naval experts.

00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:28.330
And they had all of
them sort of bone

00:49:28.330 --> 00:49:33.010
up on the knowledge of what was
the water temperature and wind

00:49:33.010 --> 00:49:35.650
speeds and where they
were on the last sighting

00:49:35.650 --> 00:49:37.690
and what was on TV
that day or whatever.

00:49:37.690 --> 00:49:39.660
They got all the
information, and each one

00:49:39.660 --> 00:49:42.880
made a guess as to where
it would be on the map.

00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:44.560
And you put them all together.

00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:46.620
And they had guesses
covering hundreds

00:49:46.620 --> 00:49:48.530
of square miles of ocean floor.

00:49:48.530 --> 00:49:50.680
And they put it all
together, and they came up

00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:53.850
within 300 yards of
the right location.

00:49:53.850 --> 00:49:57.990
So what we have over and over
here is this business of,

00:49:57.990 --> 00:50:02.420
put a lot of somewhat decent
experts together on a problem,

00:50:02.420 --> 00:50:05.790
and they will be more accurate
than almost any one single

00:50:05.790 --> 00:50:07.880
amazing expert at it.

00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:09.670
Under a few conditions.

00:50:09.670 --> 00:50:13.500
The collection of these partial
experts can't be biased.

00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:15.270
Or if they are,
they all have to be

00:50:15.270 --> 00:50:18.610
biased in a random
scattering of directions.

00:50:18.610 --> 00:50:20.724
And they need to really
do be somewhat expert.

00:50:20.724 --> 00:50:22.140
If you get a whole
bunch of people

00:50:22.140 --> 00:50:24.320
off the subway in
New York and ask

00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:26.416
them to guess the
weight of the oxen,

00:50:26.416 --> 00:50:28.540
they are not going to wisdom
of the crowd their way

00:50:28.540 --> 00:50:30.740
into being able to milk
the thing afterwards.

00:50:30.740 --> 00:50:34.340
You've got to have people who
have some experience with it.

00:50:34.340 --> 00:50:36.200
And you wind up seeing
wisdom of the crowd

00:50:36.200 --> 00:50:38.850
stuff going on in all
sorts of living systems.

00:50:38.850 --> 00:50:42.690
For example, here
is an ant colony.

00:50:42.690 --> 00:50:44.650
And here's a dead ant.

00:50:44.650 --> 00:50:46.560
And they're trying to
get the dead ant back

00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:47.364
to the ant colony.

00:50:47.364 --> 00:50:48.780
And when you look
at these things,

00:50:48.780 --> 00:50:51.740
they know how to get it, or
they get some dead beetle

00:50:51.740 --> 00:50:54.240
or something to eat, and
a whole bunch of ants

00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:56.350
push it over back
to their colony.

00:50:56.350 --> 00:50:56.850
Oh.

00:50:56.850 --> 00:51:00.000
Does each one of them
know exactly where

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:01.460
they should be pushing?

00:51:01.460 --> 00:51:01.990
No.

00:51:01.990 --> 00:51:04.190
What you have
instead is, each ant

00:51:04.190 --> 00:51:07.250
has somewhat of the
right idea as to where

00:51:07.250 --> 00:51:08.330
they should be going.

00:51:08.330 --> 00:51:11.660
And there are more ants that
have a reasonably accurate

00:51:11.660 --> 00:51:14.100
notion, a smaller number
that are somewhat off,

00:51:14.100 --> 00:51:16.990
and a really small number
that are way out of whack

00:51:16.990 --> 00:51:19.390
because in general ants
are kind of experts

00:51:19.390 --> 00:51:20.640
at finding ant colonies.

00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:21.847
They're pretty informed.

00:51:21.847 --> 00:51:23.680
And what you do is you
put them all together

00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:26.270
and you do this
vector geometry stuff.

00:51:26.270 --> 00:51:29.420
And it moves perfectly
in that direction.

00:51:29.420 --> 00:51:33.290
And no single ant knows
exactly where the colony is.

00:51:33.290 --> 00:51:36.870
You've got a wisdom of the
crowd thing here going on.

00:51:36.870 --> 00:51:38.562
OK.

00:51:38.562 --> 00:51:40.370
Where are we?

00:51:40.370 --> 00:51:41.120
Five-minute break.

00:51:44.352 --> 00:51:46.560
If you have a chance, could
you email me that website

00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:48.570
so we could post it
in the CourseWorks?

00:51:48.570 --> 00:51:49.650
That's great.

00:51:49.650 --> 00:51:52.000
OK, picking up.

00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:54.810
So now we are ready to
take some of those building

00:51:54.810 --> 00:51:59.180
blocks, wisdom of the crowd
stuff, biophysical potato

00:51:59.180 --> 00:52:01.720
chips, and begin to
see it more formally

00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:04.480
in this field of
emergent complexity.

00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:05.990
What is that about?

00:52:05.990 --> 00:52:07.620
What we've already alluded to.

00:52:07.620 --> 00:52:14.110
It's systems where you have
a very small number of rules

00:52:14.110 --> 00:52:19.670
for how very large numbers of
simple participants interact.

00:52:19.670 --> 00:52:20.850
What's that about?

00:52:20.850 --> 00:52:22.670
Here's what emergence is about.

00:52:22.670 --> 00:52:25.270
You take an ant and you
put it on a table top

00:52:25.270 --> 00:52:26.770
and you watch what
it's doing and it

00:52:26.770 --> 00:52:28.490
makes no sense whatsoever.

00:52:28.490 --> 00:52:31.700
You take 10 ants and do it and
none of them make any sense.

00:52:31.700 --> 00:52:33.880
You put 100 and they're
all scattering around.

00:52:33.880 --> 00:52:37.580
And somewhere around, I don't
know, 1,000 ants or so, they

00:52:37.580 --> 00:52:39.900
suddenly start making sense.

00:52:39.900 --> 00:52:43.030
And you put in 10,000 or
100,000 or whatever it is,

00:52:43.030 --> 00:52:46.210
and suddenly, instead of some
little thing wandering around

00:52:46.210 --> 00:52:48.950
aimlessly, you
suddenly have a colony

00:52:48.950 --> 00:52:55.370
that can grow fungi and regulate
the temperature of the colony

00:52:55.370 --> 00:52:56.590
and all these things.

00:52:56.590 --> 00:53:00.220
And suddenly, out of
these ants emerges

00:53:00.220 --> 00:53:04.920
an incredibly complex, adapted
system, an adaptive one.

00:53:04.920 --> 00:53:08.110
And the critical point
there is, no single ant

00:53:08.110 --> 00:53:10.770
knows what the temperature
should be in the colony.

00:53:10.770 --> 00:53:12.800
Or if this is time
to go out foraging

00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:14.970
in this direction instead
of that direction.

00:53:14.970 --> 00:53:20.070
It all emerges out of the
nature of ant interactions.

00:53:20.070 --> 00:53:24.210
You've got very simple
constituent parts.

00:53:24.210 --> 00:53:27.090
An ant, much like
one box that's filled

00:53:27.090 --> 00:53:29.370
in the cellular automata.

00:53:29.370 --> 00:53:32.490
You've got very
simple rules for how

00:53:32.490 --> 00:53:34.110
they interact with each other.

00:53:34.110 --> 00:53:36.407
Ants have, I don't know,
maybe 3 and 1/2 rules.

00:53:36.407 --> 00:53:38.490
Don't tell Deborah Gordon
in the department, who's

00:53:38.490 --> 00:53:39.790
an ant obsessive.

00:53:39.790 --> 00:53:42.150
But that I may be
inadvertently dissing the ants.

00:53:42.150 --> 00:53:45.740
But they have a small number of
rules as to how they interact.

00:53:45.740 --> 00:53:48.241
If you bump into an ant and you
do this with the pheromones,

00:53:48.241 --> 00:53:49.906
you go this way, and
if you go that way.

00:53:49.906 --> 00:53:51.000
And I'm just making it up.

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:52.550
They have a small
number of rules.

00:53:52.550 --> 00:53:56.900
And as long as you've got a lot
of ants doing this, out of this

00:53:56.900 --> 00:54:01.300
can emerge hugely complex
adaptive patterns.

00:54:01.300 --> 00:54:04.730
And this is what an
emergent system is about.

00:54:04.730 --> 00:54:07.020
Simple players, huge
numbers of them,

00:54:07.020 --> 00:54:10.090
simple nearest neighbor rules.

00:54:10.090 --> 00:54:13.000
And you throw them all together,
and out comes patterning.

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:17.000
And there is no single ant that
knows what the blueprint is,

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:18.990
and there's no blueprint.

00:54:18.990 --> 00:54:21.610
There is no plan
anywhere that says

00:54:21.610 --> 00:54:25.260
what the mature form of the
colony should look like.

00:54:25.260 --> 00:54:27.260
There are no instructions.

00:54:27.260 --> 00:54:31.340
It is bottom-up organization
rather than top down.

00:54:31.340 --> 00:54:34.170
And you see all sorts
of versions, then,

00:54:34.170 --> 00:54:39.540
of emergent complexity
built around, again,

00:54:39.540 --> 00:54:43.290
lots of elements of things
with a small number of very

00:54:43.290 --> 00:54:48.520
simple rules about how neighbors
interact with each other.

00:54:48.520 --> 00:54:49.680
We need that board.

00:54:49.680 --> 00:54:52.220
OK.

00:54:52.220 --> 00:54:56.050
Here we have two, four,
six, eight different cities

00:54:56.050 --> 00:54:59.660
or eight different
places where ant

00:54:59.660 --> 00:55:01.650
can find good food or
eight different something

00:55:01.650 --> 00:55:03.810
or others, eight
different locales.

00:55:03.810 --> 00:55:05.900
And you were trying to
do something efficient.

00:55:05.900 --> 00:55:09.440
You need to go to each one
of them to sell your product

00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:11.760
or to see if there's
good food there or not.

00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:13.260
You need to go to
all eight of them,

00:55:13.260 --> 00:55:16.140
and you want to do it as
efficiently as possible.

00:55:16.140 --> 00:55:20.100
You want to find the way to
have the shortest possible path

00:55:20.100 --> 00:55:21.750
to go to all of these places.

00:55:21.750 --> 00:55:26.260
And this is the classic
traveling salesman problem.

00:55:26.260 --> 00:55:28.550
And nobody at this
point can solve it.

00:55:28.550 --> 00:55:30.980
There's no formal
mathematical solution.

00:55:30.980 --> 00:55:33.330
And by the time you get
to, like, eight locales,

00:55:33.330 --> 00:55:36.180
there's, like, hundreds of
billions of different ways

00:55:36.180 --> 00:55:37.300
you can do it.

00:55:37.300 --> 00:55:40.310
So how can-- you can't come
up with the perfect solution.

00:55:40.310 --> 00:55:44.000
But you could come up with maybe
kind of a good, decent one.

00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:45.560
There's two ways
you could do it.

00:55:45.560 --> 00:55:49.840
First is to have an unbelievably
good computer that just,

00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:54.640
by sheer force, cranks out a
bazillion different outcomes

00:55:54.640 --> 00:55:57.700
and in each case measures
how much you're doing it.

00:55:57.700 --> 00:56:01.230
And you can get something
close to an optimal answer.

00:56:01.230 --> 00:56:04.200
The other way of doing
it is to have yourself

00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:07.280
some virtual ants in
something that is now

00:56:07.280 --> 00:56:09.810
called swarm intelligence.

00:56:09.810 --> 00:56:11.150
Here's what you do.

00:56:11.150 --> 00:56:14.100
You need to have two
generations of ants.

00:56:14.100 --> 00:56:16.395
The first generation,
you stick them all down,

00:56:16.395 --> 00:56:18.020
different numbers of
them, and they all

00:56:18.020 --> 00:56:19.520
start off in these
different cities,

00:56:19.520 --> 00:56:20.800
these different locales.

00:56:20.800 --> 00:56:25.810
And their rule is, each one
of them goes to another city.

00:56:25.810 --> 00:56:28.630
Each one of them goes
to another destination.

00:56:28.630 --> 00:56:30.670
But here's the follow-me rule.

00:56:30.670 --> 00:56:34.130
The ants are leaving a pheromone
trail, pheromone trail,

00:56:34.130 --> 00:56:35.960
and they stick
their rear end down.

00:56:35.960 --> 00:56:36.460
What is it?

00:56:36.460 --> 00:56:37.690
Head, thorax, abdomen.

00:56:37.690 --> 00:56:39.280
And they stick
their abdomen down.

00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:41.130
And they've got a
gland at the bottom

00:56:41.130 --> 00:56:43.300
there, which
releases a pheromone

00:56:43.300 --> 00:56:46.710
and makes a track, a scent
track, of the pheromone there.

00:56:46.710 --> 00:56:50.410
And a very simple rule,
they have a finite amount

00:56:50.410 --> 00:56:55.290
of pheromone in there to expend
on the entire path they're

00:56:55.290 --> 00:56:57.170
making.

00:56:57.170 --> 00:57:00.290
In other words, the
shorter the path,

00:57:00.290 --> 00:57:03.040
the thicker the pheromone
trail is going to be.

00:57:05.940 --> 00:57:08.570
Now what you do is
deal with the fact

00:57:08.570 --> 00:57:11.850
that the pheromones
dissipate after a while.

00:57:11.850 --> 00:57:13.410
They evaporate.

00:57:13.410 --> 00:57:16.690
And thus, the thicker
the path, the longer

00:57:16.690 --> 00:57:19.480
it's going to be there.

00:57:19.480 --> 00:57:22.640
You now take a second
generation of virtual ants,

00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:24.230
and you throw them in there.

00:57:24.230 --> 00:57:27.760
And what their rule is,
they wander around randomly.

00:57:27.760 --> 00:57:30.690
And any time they hit
a pheromone trail,

00:57:30.690 --> 00:57:33.850
they join the trail
one way or the other,

00:57:33.850 --> 00:57:36.510
and they lay down a
pheromone trail of their own

00:57:36.510 --> 00:57:37.350
with their abdomen.

00:57:37.350 --> 00:57:40.640
They reinforce the
markings on this trail.

00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:43.770
And let 10,000
virtual ants do that

00:57:43.770 --> 00:57:47.340
for a couple of hundred
thousand rounds of generations,

00:57:47.340 --> 00:57:50.950
and they solve the traveling
salesman problem for you.

00:57:50.950 --> 00:57:54.040
Because it winds up
being, the short paths,

00:57:54.040 --> 00:57:57.850
the more efficient ways
of connecting locales,

00:57:57.850 --> 00:58:00.870
will leave larger,
thicker trails,

00:58:00.870 --> 00:58:04.110
which are more likely to
last longer and thus increase

00:58:04.110 --> 00:58:07.060
the odds that an ant
wandering around randomly

00:58:07.060 --> 00:58:09.680
will bump into it
and reinforce it.

00:58:09.680 --> 00:58:12.040
And what you see
is, initially, there

00:58:12.040 --> 00:58:13.980
will be every possible path.

00:58:13.980 --> 00:58:16.110
And as you run
this over and over,

00:58:16.110 --> 00:58:18.480
it will begin to fade
out, and out will

00:58:18.480 --> 00:58:20.670
emerge the more efficient ones.

00:58:20.670 --> 00:58:23.860
You can optimize the
outcome doing it this way,

00:58:23.860 --> 00:58:26.810
just asking virtual
ants to do it for you.

00:58:26.810 --> 00:58:30.100
And this is exactly how ants
do it out in the real world.

00:58:30.100 --> 00:58:31.870
When they're foraging
in different places,

00:58:31.870 --> 00:58:34.330
there is a first wave
of them that comes out,

00:58:34.330 --> 00:58:37.690
and they go to locales
leaving scent trails.

00:58:37.690 --> 00:58:39.840
And then there are the
wanderers that come in,

00:58:39.840 --> 00:58:42.260
and when they hit a
trail they join it.

00:58:42.260 --> 00:58:46.090
There are now telecommunications
companies that use swarm

00:58:46.090 --> 00:58:49.270
intelligence to figure out
what's the shortest length

00:58:49.270 --> 00:58:53.340
of cable they need to use to
connect up eight different

00:58:53.340 --> 00:58:56.950
states' worth of
telecommunication towers,

00:58:56.950 --> 00:58:58.150
whatever they're called.

00:58:58.150 --> 00:58:59.722
And they can sit
there and do math

00:58:59.722 --> 00:59:01.180
till the end of
the universe trying

00:59:01.180 --> 00:59:04.130
to figure out the cheapest
way to wire them up.

00:59:04.130 --> 00:59:07.540
Or they can use
swarm intelligence.

00:59:07.540 --> 00:59:09.990
And that's what a lot of
them do at this point.

00:59:09.990 --> 00:59:11.550
It works.

00:59:11.550 --> 00:59:12.920
What are the features of it?

00:59:12.920 --> 00:59:15.080
This is not wisdom of the crowd.

00:59:15.080 --> 00:59:19.140
This is not that every ant knows
a solution to the traveling

00:59:19.140 --> 00:59:22.040
salesman problem, except none of
them have the perfect solution.

00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:23.665
But put them all
together, and they all

00:59:23.665 --> 00:59:24.720
get to vote on outcomes.

00:59:24.720 --> 00:59:27.940
The ant don't know from
traveling salesman problems.

00:59:27.940 --> 00:59:30.940
The ant knows nothing about
trying to optimize this.

00:59:30.940 --> 00:59:34.170
All the ant knows is one
of two different rules.

00:59:34.170 --> 00:59:36.570
If I'm walking from one
of these to one of these,

00:59:36.570 --> 00:59:39.700
the longer I walk, the
thinner the pheromone trail.

00:59:39.700 --> 00:59:43.680
Or rule number two, if I
stumble into one of these,

00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:46.380
I join it and put down
my markings there.

00:59:46.380 --> 00:59:50.400
Two simple rules,
one very simple type

00:59:50.400 --> 00:59:54.320
of sort of unit of
information in there, an ant.

00:59:54.320 --> 00:59:57.590
And all you need to do is make
sure there's enough of them,

00:59:57.590 --> 01:00:00.680
and they solve the
problem for you.

01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:02.960
This winds up explaining
another thing.

01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:06.400
How do bees pick a
new nesting site?

01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:10.117
A bee's nest, a bee's--
hornet's nest, a bee's nest.

01:00:10.117 --> 01:00:12.200
Every now and then the
bees need to leave and pick

01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:13.210
a new place to live.

01:00:13.210 --> 01:00:15.520
And how do they figure
out the good place?

01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:18.420
And there's all sorts of
criteria of nutrients.

01:00:18.420 --> 01:00:21.650
And so all sorts of bees go
out there, and what they do

01:00:21.650 --> 01:00:23.490
is they look for food sources.

01:00:23.490 --> 01:00:25.940
And they look for a place
that will have a lot of food.

01:00:25.940 --> 01:00:29.370
Maybe that's a place to
go and move the colony.

01:00:29.370 --> 01:00:32.360
So we know already, the bee will
go out and find its food there,

01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:33.240
its food source.

01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:34.450
It will come back in.

01:00:34.450 --> 01:00:37.200
And here's the colony
cut in cross-section.

01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:40.250
And what you wind up having
is this ring of bees.

01:00:40.250 --> 01:00:41.380
Here is the entry.

01:00:41.380 --> 01:00:43.509
And you have the
bee dancing going on

01:00:43.509 --> 01:00:45.800
that we've heard about in
the middle of the dance floor

01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:46.320
there.

01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:49.830
And we've already heard it's
this pattern of this figure

01:00:49.830 --> 01:00:51.440
eight while shaking
the rear end.

01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:53.365
And we know what
the information is,

01:00:53.365 --> 01:00:59.300
which is the angle tells the
direction to go out there.

01:00:59.300 --> 01:01:01.960
And the extent to
which it's wiggling

01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:05.270
its rear end is how long
you're supposed to fly for.

01:01:05.270 --> 01:01:09.230
But the final variable is,
the better the resource,

01:01:09.230 --> 01:01:13.250
the longer you do the dance.

01:01:13.250 --> 01:01:15.820
So you've got bees coming in
from all over the place that

01:01:15.820 --> 01:01:17.320
have found good
resources, that have

01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:19.090
found so-so ones, all of that.

01:01:19.090 --> 01:01:21.820
And so there's bees doing
all this dancing stuff here

01:01:21.820 --> 01:01:23.590
of different durations.

01:01:23.590 --> 01:01:26.920
And the ones who have
found the good solution

01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:30.890
to where do we want to
live are dancing longer.

01:01:30.890 --> 01:01:33.450
The ones who have found
the most efficient path

01:01:33.450 --> 01:01:36.540
are leaving a message longer.

01:01:36.540 --> 01:01:39.080
So now you bring in
your second generation.

01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:41.780
And the rule is
among bees, if they

01:01:41.780 --> 01:01:45.160
happen to bump into a bee
that is doing a dance,

01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:47.890
the bee responds and goes
where it tells you to go.

01:01:47.890 --> 01:01:51.420
So a bee may randomly sort of
bump into one of these guys

01:01:51.420 --> 01:01:52.540
and then off it goes.

01:01:52.540 --> 01:01:54.790
Actually, I'm sure it's
more complicated than this,

01:01:54.790 --> 01:01:56.860
but it's along the
lines of there's now

01:01:56.860 --> 01:01:59.010
random interactions.

01:01:59.010 --> 01:02:04.300
If one of the peripheral
bees encounters, bumps into,

01:02:04.300 --> 01:02:06.370
one of these bees
that has information,

01:02:06.370 --> 01:02:09.570
it joins in in that bee's group.

01:02:09.570 --> 01:02:12.220
And it then goes and
finds the food resource

01:02:12.220 --> 01:02:14.210
and comes back with
the information.

01:02:14.210 --> 01:02:19.560
So thus, by definition, if you
have found a great food source,

01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:21.940
you're going to
be dancing longer,

01:02:21.940 --> 01:02:25.280
which increases the odds of
other bees randomly bumping

01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:29.090
into you, which causes them to
go and find the same great food

01:02:29.090 --> 01:02:31.780
source and come back
and dance longer.

01:02:31.780 --> 01:02:34.220
And the ones with lousy ones
are coming in and dancing

01:02:34.220 --> 01:02:36.510
very briefly, and thus
there is hardly any odds

01:02:36.510 --> 01:02:37.980
of somebody bumping into them.

01:02:37.980 --> 01:02:41.090
And what you begin to
do is, you suddenly

01:02:41.090 --> 01:02:43.540
optimize where the
hive is supposed to go.

01:02:43.540 --> 01:02:45.660
Again, it's not
wisdom of the crowd.

01:02:45.660 --> 01:02:50.340
It is an emergent feature of
one generation with information

01:02:50.340 --> 01:02:53.530
based on some very simple
rules, and one information

01:02:53.530 --> 01:02:55.880
that generates
some random element

01:02:55.880 --> 01:03:00.020
and out comes an ideal solution.

01:03:00.020 --> 01:03:01.900
More versions of this.

01:03:01.900 --> 01:03:05.410
Another domain where some
very simple rules out of it

01:03:05.410 --> 01:03:08.400
emerges something very
complex and adaptive.

01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:11.160
OK, so the themes here
are two generations,

01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:13.781
the more adaptive the
signal, the stronger it is

01:03:13.781 --> 01:03:14.780
and the longer it lasts.

01:03:14.780 --> 01:03:16.700
And then the
randomization element.

01:03:16.700 --> 01:03:19.780
Another theme that comes through
in a lot of emergence, which

01:03:19.780 --> 01:03:23.730
is to have your elements
in there, your ants,

01:03:23.730 --> 01:03:25.610
your bees, your
traveling salesmen,

01:03:25.610 --> 01:03:27.290
whatever the constituents are.

01:03:27.290 --> 01:03:30.470
And now what the rules
are are simple rules

01:03:30.470 --> 01:03:33.650
of attraction and repulsion.

01:03:33.650 --> 01:03:36.120
Which is to say,
some of the elements

01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:39.020
are attracted to each other,
and some of the elements

01:03:39.020 --> 01:03:40.920
are repulsed by each other.

01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:43.460
Some are pulled together,
some are pushed apart

01:03:43.460 --> 01:03:46.520
like, for example, magnets.

01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:49.080
Magnets are polarized
in the sense

01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:51.840
that magnets only have
two ways of interacting

01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:54.940
with each other, simple
nearest neighbor rules.

01:03:54.940 --> 01:03:57.050
They're either
attracting or repelling,

01:03:57.050 --> 01:03:59.480
depending on the orientation.

01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:01.130
So here's what you do now.

01:04:01.130 --> 01:04:03.910
You take a system and
something very simple.

01:04:03.910 --> 01:04:08.470
You've got some simulated
SimCity sort of thing

01:04:08.470 --> 01:04:12.240
where you're letting the
system run to design a city.

01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:15.130
You want to do your urban
planning in your city

01:04:15.130 --> 01:04:16.800
that you're going
to construct there.

01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:19.080
And what you do is,
you can sit there

01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:24.980
and you can study millions of
laws about zoning and economics

01:04:24.980 --> 01:04:27.870
and all of that to decide
something very simple.

01:04:27.870 --> 01:04:30.800
Where are you going to put
the commercial districts?

01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:34.060
And where are the residential
districts going to be?

01:04:34.060 --> 01:04:37.920
Or you can have just a small
number of simple rules.

01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:41.230
Which is, for example,
if a market appears

01:04:41.230 --> 01:04:46.200
in some place, what it
attracts is a Starbucks.

01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:50.380
And what it also attracts
is a clothing store

01:04:50.380 --> 01:04:51.520
or some such thing.

01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:52.890
So a bunch of rules.

01:04:52.890 --> 01:04:54.500
But then you have
repulsion rules,

01:04:54.500 --> 01:04:56.770
which is, if you
have a Starbucks,

01:04:56.770 --> 01:04:59.180
it will repulse any
other Starbucks.

01:04:59.180 --> 01:05:02.030
So the nearest other Starbucks
can be this far away.

01:05:02.030 --> 01:05:03.970
If you have a
competitor's market,

01:05:03.970 --> 01:05:05.980
it can't get any
closer than this.

01:05:05.980 --> 01:05:08.980
That sort of thing, these simple
attraction/repulsion rules.

01:05:08.980 --> 01:05:10.750
And what you wind
up getting when

01:05:10.750 --> 01:05:19.050
you run these simulations are
commercial districts in a city

01:05:19.050 --> 01:05:24.000
where you get clusters of
commercial sort of places that

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.290
are balanced by
attraction and repulsion

01:05:26.290 --> 01:05:29.310
where you have thoroughfares
connecting them.

01:05:29.310 --> 01:05:33.320
And the more elements there
are in the two neighborhood

01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:36.920
commercial centers, the bigger
the connection is going to be,

01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:40.820
the bigger the street is, the
more lanes, the more powerful

01:05:40.820 --> 01:05:42.470
the signal coming through there.

01:05:42.470 --> 01:05:43.640
And you throw it in.

01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:46.350
And out pops an
urban plan that looks

01:05:46.350 --> 01:05:48.750
exactly like the sort
of ones that the best

01:05:48.750 --> 01:05:50.510
urban planners come up with.

01:05:50.510 --> 01:05:53.800
And all you need to do instead
is run these simulations

01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:57.490
with some very simple
attraction and repulsion rules.

01:05:57.490 --> 01:06:00.100
So you do that, and it winds
up producing stuff that looks

01:06:00.100 --> 01:06:01.520
like cities.

01:06:01.520 --> 01:06:04.360
You do that with a
bunch of neurons.

01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:07.100
You take a Petri dish, and
you throw in a whole bunch

01:06:07.100 --> 01:06:08.480
of individual neurons.

01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:10.890
And they have very simple rules.

01:06:10.890 --> 01:06:15.060
They secrete factors which
attract some types of neurons.

01:06:15.060 --> 01:06:19.040
And they secrete factors which
repel other types of neurons.

01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:22.230
And all of them are having
some very simple rules.

01:06:22.230 --> 01:06:25.080
When I encounter this,
I grow projections

01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:26.860
towards where it's coming from.

01:06:26.860 --> 01:06:29.450
If I encounter that,
I grow projections

01:06:29.450 --> 01:06:30.640
in the opposite direction.

01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:32.950
Simple attraction and repulsion.

01:06:32.950 --> 01:06:35.280
And what you do
is, at this point,

01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:38.200
you throw in a whole bunch
of neurons, each one where

01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:39.630
you throw into a Petri dish.

01:06:39.630 --> 01:06:42.530
And at the beginning they're
all scattered evenly all

01:06:42.530 --> 01:06:43.340
over the place.

01:06:43.340 --> 01:06:46.060
And you come back, and you
come back two days later,

01:06:46.060 --> 01:06:49.220
and it looks just like this.

01:06:49.220 --> 01:06:52.580
You have clusters of
neurons sending projections,

01:06:52.580 --> 01:06:55.380
and you have all these empty
residential areas in between.

01:06:55.380 --> 01:06:58.620
And if you just mark this
in a schematic way, looking

01:06:58.620 --> 01:07:00.850
from above you're not
going to be able to tell,

01:07:00.850 --> 01:07:03.330
is this the commercial
districts in a big city?

01:07:03.330 --> 01:07:05.990
Or are these neurons
growing in a dish?

01:07:05.990 --> 01:07:10.210
And you get areas of nuclei
of cell bodies and areas

01:07:10.210 --> 01:07:14.220
of projections, and it winds
up looking exactly like that.

01:07:14.220 --> 01:07:18.950
And amazingly, there was a paper
in Science earlier this year.

01:07:18.950 --> 01:07:21.170
And it was looking at
one of these versions,

01:07:21.170 --> 01:07:23.550
again, in this case
attraction and repulsion

01:07:23.550 --> 01:07:26.410
rules with ants' colonies
setting up foraging paths.

01:07:26.410 --> 01:07:29.330
And they explicitly
compared one colony

01:07:29.330 --> 01:07:32.340
to the efficiency of the
distribution of the train

01:07:32.340 --> 01:07:35.040
stations in the
Tokyo subway system.

01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:38.190
And what they showed was
very similar solutions,

01:07:38.190 --> 01:07:40.920
but the ants had gotten
a more optimal one.

01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:44.810
And the subway system had
people sitting there salaried

01:07:44.810 --> 01:07:46.750
to figure out the
best way to do it.

01:07:46.750 --> 01:07:49.355
All the ants had were
very simple rules

01:07:49.355 --> 01:07:52.710
of, if it's someone from the
other colony I stay this way,

01:07:52.710 --> 01:07:54.880
if it's someone from
mine, simple attraction

01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:55.700
and repulsion.

01:07:55.700 --> 01:07:59.330
And out comes something that
looks like this as well.

01:07:59.330 --> 01:08:03.390
So here you see that happening
with a remarkably small number

01:08:03.390 --> 01:08:04.990
of rules.

01:08:04.990 --> 01:08:08.670
Now you put it into a really
interesting context, which

01:08:08.670 --> 01:08:12.600
is something we bumped into back
when first introducing proteins

01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:16.000
and DNA sequence equals shape
equals function, all of that.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.086
Molecules have charges on them.

01:08:18.086 --> 01:08:20.169
Some of them were positively
charged, some of them

01:08:20.169 --> 01:08:21.200
were negatively.

01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:22.140
Whoa.

01:08:22.140 --> 01:08:24.569
Attraction and repulsion.

01:08:24.569 --> 01:08:26.979
Positively charged
molecules are attracted

01:08:26.979 --> 01:08:28.510
to negatively charged ones.

01:08:28.510 --> 01:08:30.250
Same charged ones repulse.

01:08:30.250 --> 01:08:34.100
Here we have a system with very
simple attraction and repulsion

01:08:34.100 --> 01:08:35.550
rules.

01:08:35.550 --> 01:08:38.740
And that's the logic behind,
when one thinks about it,

01:08:38.740 --> 01:08:42.069
one of the all-time important
experiments, something

01:08:42.069 --> 01:08:45.510
that was done in the 1950s by a
pair of scientists, University

01:08:45.510 --> 01:08:47.750
of Chicago, Urey and Miller.

01:08:47.750 --> 01:08:48.990
Here's what they did.

01:08:48.990 --> 01:08:52.750
They took, like, big
vats of organic soup

01:08:52.750 --> 01:08:57.800
stuff that just had all sorts
of simple molecules in there.

01:08:57.800 --> 01:09:00.939
Little fragments of carbon,
carbon, little fragments

01:09:00.939 --> 01:09:04.370
of-- all sorts of inorganic
molecules in there,

01:09:04.370 --> 01:09:08.550
little ones in there, floating
around in this organic soup.

01:09:08.550 --> 01:09:12.149
And what they did was they would
pass electricity through it.

01:09:12.149 --> 01:09:15.600
And they did this
vast numbers of times.

01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:18.279
And eventually
what they saw was,

01:09:18.279 --> 01:09:22.490
they would come back and check,
and these random distribution

01:09:22.490 --> 01:09:25.420
of these things, of
these little fragments,

01:09:25.420 --> 01:09:29.410
had begun to form amino acids.

01:09:29.410 --> 01:09:30.740
Whoa.

01:09:30.740 --> 01:09:32.149
Metaphor.

01:09:32.149 --> 01:09:36.410
The organic soup, just the
evenly distributed sort

01:09:36.410 --> 01:09:40.370
of world of potentially
organic molecules

01:09:40.370 --> 01:09:44.020
in a world in which electricity
passes through, lightning.

01:09:44.020 --> 01:09:46.160
What had these guys
just come up with?

01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:49.603
Some in your, like,
kitchen sink experiment

01:09:49.603 --> 01:09:52.979
of the origins of life.

01:09:52.979 --> 01:09:55.560
And what people have done
subsequently is show,

01:09:55.560 --> 01:09:57.320
you don't need the catalyst.

01:09:57.320 --> 01:09:59.640
There's a whole
world of researchers

01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:01.040
who study origin of life.

01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:06.040
And the basic notion is, you
put in enough simple molecules

01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:08.980
in there that have attraction
and repulsion rules,

01:10:08.980 --> 01:10:11.870
and you get perturbations
and spatial distributions

01:10:11.870 --> 01:10:14.300
of certain ways,
and they will begin

01:10:14.300 --> 01:10:18.809
to form rational
structures after a while.

01:10:18.809 --> 01:10:20.100
Here's another version of this.

01:10:20.100 --> 01:10:22.183
And I used to do this in
class, except I can never

01:10:22.183 --> 01:10:26.030
pull this one off, and
it just became chaotic.

01:10:26.030 --> 01:10:29.250
Kid's toy, you've
got these magnets.

01:10:29.250 --> 01:10:32.440
You either have-- you
have magnets like that.

01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:34.180
And then you have
little metal balls that

01:10:34.180 --> 01:10:36.070
can go onto the magnet here.

01:10:36.070 --> 01:10:38.170
And you've got vast
numbers of them.

01:10:38.170 --> 01:10:40.490
And you can piece them together.

01:10:40.490 --> 01:10:40.990
Whoa.

01:10:40.990 --> 01:10:43.350
This is starting to look
kind of familiar here.

01:10:43.350 --> 01:10:46.720
So we have these constituents
with very simple rules, which

01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:48.860
is the magnets repel each other.

01:10:48.860 --> 01:10:49.800
They bind.

01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:50.412
These things.

01:10:50.412 --> 01:10:51.620
And here's what you would do.

01:10:51.620 --> 01:10:52.760
Here's what I would
attempt to do.

01:10:52.760 --> 01:10:54.610
First off, I would get
somebody to show me

01:10:54.610 --> 01:10:57.600
how to get the video thing
on here to project it.

01:10:57.600 --> 01:11:01.010
But you would put up a whole
bunch of these magnets in rows,

01:11:01.010 --> 01:11:04.300
not too close to each
other, nice and symmetrical.

01:11:04.300 --> 01:11:07.460
And what you do then is you take
a handful of the metal balls

01:11:07.460 --> 01:11:09.150
and fling them in there.

01:11:09.150 --> 01:11:11.530
And if you do that
400 or 500 times,

01:11:11.530 --> 01:11:13.620
eventually they
will bounce around.

01:11:13.620 --> 01:11:15.960
And amid all the
pieces flying, you're

01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:20.970
going to get a pyramidal
structure like this.

01:11:20.970 --> 01:11:24.090
One of those just like that,
it's three dimensional,

01:11:24.090 --> 01:11:24.920
you know that.

01:11:24.920 --> 01:11:27.880
You are going to get one of
those that will simply pop out

01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:32.280
of this because that's the
nature of potato chips solving

01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:34.510
their math problem
with double saddles.

01:11:34.510 --> 01:11:37.610
That's the nature of throwing
a whole bunch of elements

01:11:37.610 --> 01:11:40.060
with simple attraction
and repulsion rules.

01:11:40.060 --> 01:11:43.980
And given enough chances, throw
in enough perturbations there,

01:11:43.980 --> 01:11:47.010
and structures will
begin to emerge.

01:11:47.010 --> 01:11:50.090
And it's the same
exact principle there,

01:11:50.090 --> 01:11:52.560
these same ones over and over.

01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:54.530
So we've got some very
simple versions where

01:11:54.530 --> 01:11:56.250
you get emergent complexity.

01:11:56.250 --> 01:11:59.120
One is this version
of a first generation

01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:01.560
has directed searches
and the intensity

01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:03.430
of the signal that
it leaves afterward

01:12:03.430 --> 01:12:05.070
is a function of
how good of a search

01:12:05.070 --> 01:12:06.990
they've done, random wanderers.

01:12:06.990 --> 01:12:09.650
Then you have the
attraction/repulsion world

01:12:09.650 --> 01:12:11.940
of putting these together,
lots of elements.

01:12:11.940 --> 01:12:14.890
And you begin to get
structures out of it.

01:12:14.890 --> 01:12:17.180
Next version of
this, or next domain

01:12:17.180 --> 01:12:21.130
of where you begin to see
the fact that these rules are

01:12:21.130 --> 01:12:24.070
underlying an awful
lot of things.

01:12:24.070 --> 01:12:27.820
Suppose here you were
studying earthquakes.

01:12:27.820 --> 01:12:30.850
And apparently there's just,
like, little earthquakes going

01:12:30.850 --> 01:12:34.870
on 20 times an hour or so
all down on the Richter

01:12:34.870 --> 01:12:38.620
scale of, you know, one
quarter or who knows what.

01:12:38.620 --> 01:12:41.720
But you get enough of these,
you get a huge database,

01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:46.290
and you can begin to graph
the frequency of Richter 1.0

01:12:46.290 --> 01:12:49.090
earthquakes and how often do you
get the Richter 2.0 and Richter

01:12:49.090 --> 01:12:50.010
3.0 and all of that.

01:12:50.010 --> 01:12:52.200
And you graph it.

01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:57.500
And it's going to look
something like this,

01:12:57.500 --> 01:13:00.520
a distribution like
that, which is obviously

01:13:00.520 --> 01:13:03.240
there's a huge number of
number one categories.

01:13:03.240 --> 01:13:06.660
And it drops off until the
extremely rare at this end.

01:13:06.660 --> 01:13:09.670
There's a distribution,
which mathematically

01:13:09.670 --> 01:13:12.150
can be described, something
called a power law

01:13:12.150 --> 01:13:14.850
distribution, with a
certain angle to it.

01:13:14.850 --> 01:13:18.070
OK, so here's the
relationship between how often

01:13:18.070 --> 01:13:21.450
do you get little teensy
earthquakes and the big ones.

01:13:21.450 --> 01:13:26.630
Now instead, what you do
is something much more

01:13:26.630 --> 01:13:31.170
different from that, which
is, you look at 50,000 people,

01:13:31.170 --> 01:13:32.940
and you look at
their phone calls

01:13:32.940 --> 01:13:34.550
over the course of the year.

01:13:34.550 --> 01:13:37.390
And you keep track
of how far the phone

01:13:37.390 --> 01:13:41.250
call was, how distant the
person is that they called.

01:13:41.250 --> 01:13:44.490
And now you map the distance,
the very shortest calls,

01:13:44.490 --> 01:13:46.150
the very longest,
and the frequency.

01:13:46.150 --> 01:13:49.120
And it's the exact same curve.

01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:52.570
It's the same power
law distribution.

01:13:52.570 --> 01:13:53.670
Next version of it.

01:13:53.670 --> 01:13:56.380
This was a study that was
done, which was-- I don't quite

01:13:56.380 --> 01:13:57.580
know how these guys did it.

01:13:57.580 --> 01:13:59.920
I always get lost in
the math on these.

01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:01.860
But in this one,
what they did was

01:14:01.860 --> 01:14:04.920
they took a whole bunch
of marked dollar bills,

01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:07.570
and they started in the middle
of-- I don't know where,

01:14:07.570 --> 01:14:09.380
I think it was at
Columbia, something--

01:14:09.380 --> 01:14:11.630
and they were
somehow able to keep

01:14:11.630 --> 01:14:15.700
track of how far the bills
had traveled a week later.

01:14:15.700 --> 01:14:18.140
And asking, OK,
how many bills had

01:14:18.140 --> 01:14:20.120
traveled no more than a mile?

01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:21.890
How many five miles?

01:14:21.890 --> 01:14:24.330
And it was the exact same curve.

01:14:24.330 --> 01:14:27.010
And people now have been
showing this same power law

01:14:27.010 --> 01:14:27.889
distribution.

01:14:27.889 --> 01:14:29.930
Here are some of the things
that have been shown.

01:14:29.930 --> 01:14:32.620
The number of
links that websites

01:14:32.620 --> 01:14:34.160
have to other websites.

01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:36.480
The number that
have only one link.

01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:39.150
Power law distribution.

01:14:39.150 --> 01:14:40.230
Proteins.

01:14:40.230 --> 01:14:44.320
The number of proteins showing
certain degrees of complexity

01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:47.750
and the numbers dropping
off with the same power law.

01:14:47.750 --> 01:14:51.200
Here's one which is the
number of emails somebody

01:14:51.200 --> 01:14:52.620
sends over the
course of the year.

01:14:52.620 --> 01:14:54.369
This is the one that
was done at Columbia.

01:14:54.369 --> 01:14:56.520
They got access to
everybody's email records.

01:14:56.520 --> 01:14:58.590
I don't understand how
they could have done this.

01:14:58.590 --> 01:15:01.920
But it was a couple of million
over the course of the year.

01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:05.680
And what they showed was the
frequency, how many people

01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:08.690
were making this small of
a number of emails over--

01:15:08.690 --> 01:15:10.890
and the same power law.

01:15:10.890 --> 01:15:13.520
Then there's this
totally crazy one,

01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:17.600
which is, OK, do you guys know
the Kevin Bacon, six degrees

01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:20.000
of separation thing there?

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:20.540
OK.

01:15:20.540 --> 01:15:22.920
Someone went and did
a study about this

01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:25.340
that they got, like,
every actor that they

01:15:25.340 --> 01:15:28.930
could find who was in a
film in the last two years.

01:15:28.930 --> 01:15:31.480
And they got all of
their filmographies.

01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:34.930
And they generated their Kevin
Bacon degrees of freedom,

01:15:34.930 --> 01:15:37.854
degrees of--

01:15:37.854 --> 01:15:38.830
Separation.

01:15:38.830 --> 01:15:39.540
Sing it out.

01:15:39.540 --> 01:15:40.120
OK.

01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:42.860
And they figured it out, the
number for each individual.

01:15:42.860 --> 01:15:44.470
And then they graphed it.

01:15:44.470 --> 01:15:47.770
How many people were six
degrees of separation away,

01:15:47.770 --> 01:15:49.570
how many were five, so on.

01:15:49.570 --> 01:15:51.360
And it's the same pattern.

01:15:51.360 --> 01:15:55.150
And this one keeps popping
up, this power law business.

01:15:55.150 --> 01:15:58.960
And what you see intrinsic
in that is, it's a fractal.

01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:00.740
Because some of the
time you're talking

01:16:00.740 --> 01:16:03.441
about what's happening with
the tectonic plates on Earth,

01:16:03.441 --> 01:16:05.690
and some of the time you're
talking about phone calls,

01:16:05.690 --> 01:16:07.981
and some of the time you're
talking about how molecules

01:16:07.981 --> 01:16:09.420
interact with each other.

01:16:09.420 --> 01:16:11.680
There's something
emergent that goes

01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:14.870
on there, which is
an outcome of some

01:16:14.870 --> 01:16:18.200
of these simple
attraction/repulsion rules,

01:16:18.200 --> 01:16:21.380
an outcome of simple
pioneer generation

01:16:21.380 --> 01:16:23.030
and then random movement ones.

01:16:23.030 --> 01:16:26.386
And out come
structures like these.

01:16:26.386 --> 01:16:30.230
This winds up being applicable
in a very interesting domain

01:16:30.230 --> 01:16:33.010
biologically.

01:16:33.010 --> 01:16:36.280
OK, so now we go back to the
traveling salesman problem.

01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:39.240
And we're having now a
cellular version of it

01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:40.710
in terms of networks.

01:16:40.710 --> 01:16:44.960
You've got a whole
bunch of nodes here.

01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:48.230
And the choice that
each node has to make,

01:16:48.230 --> 01:16:50.970
in effect, is how
many connections it

01:16:50.970 --> 01:16:54.640
will make in the network
to other nodes and how far

01:16:54.640 --> 01:16:56.760
should those connections be.

01:16:56.760 --> 01:16:59.230
Should it only connect
with ones way out there?

01:16:59.230 --> 01:17:00.520
What does it want to do?

01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:01.490
That's nonsense.

01:17:01.490 --> 01:17:04.610
In terms of optimizing
a system, what

01:17:04.610 --> 01:17:08.170
do you want your distribution
of connections of nodes

01:17:08.170 --> 01:17:09.220
in a network to be?

01:17:09.220 --> 01:17:10.940
What is it you want to optimize?

01:17:10.940 --> 01:17:12.690
You want to get
a system that has

01:17:12.690 --> 01:17:17.360
very stable, solid interactions
amongst clusters of nodes

01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:19.530
but nevertheless
occasionally has

01:17:19.530 --> 01:17:22.820
the capacity to make
long-distance connections

01:17:22.820 --> 01:17:23.710
there.

01:17:23.710 --> 01:17:26.910
And what you wind up
seeing is, if you generate

01:17:26.910 --> 01:17:31.570
a power law distribution
in terms of, OK, all

01:17:31.570 --> 01:17:34.446
of my projections are going
to be within this distance

01:17:34.446 --> 01:17:37.980
and within this same
power law distribution

01:17:37.980 --> 01:17:41.600
so that the vast majority
of the nodes in the network

01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:43.590
are having very
local connections.

01:17:43.590 --> 01:17:47.630
But still there is a possibility
now and then of very long ones.

01:17:47.630 --> 01:17:51.350
You get a system that is
the most optimal for solving

01:17:51.350 --> 01:17:55.640
problems most cheaply, cheaply,
and whatever the term is there.

01:17:55.640 --> 01:17:58.510
And this solves it for you.

01:17:58.510 --> 01:18:00.810
And then you look at
brain development.

01:18:00.810 --> 01:18:03.990
So you've got neurons
forming in the cortex,

01:18:03.990 --> 01:18:07.570
in the fetal cortex,
and you've got neurons.

01:18:07.570 --> 01:18:08.980
You've got all these nodes.

01:18:08.980 --> 01:18:12.610
And they have to figure out
how to wire up with each other

01:18:12.610 --> 01:18:15.570
and how to wire up in a
way that is most efficient.

01:18:15.570 --> 01:18:17.660
What's most efficient
in order to be

01:18:17.660 --> 01:18:21.630
able to do the sorts of things
the cortex specializes in?

01:18:21.630 --> 01:18:25.770
And you now begin to look at
the distribution of projections.

01:18:25.770 --> 01:18:28.940
And it's a power
law relationship.

01:18:28.940 --> 01:18:32.000
Most neurons in the
cortex are having

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:35.380
the vast majority of their
projections very local.

01:18:35.380 --> 01:18:37.260
But then you have
ones now and then

01:18:37.260 --> 01:18:39.360
that have moderate ones,
even rarer ones, that

01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:41.150
have extremely long ones.

01:18:41.150 --> 01:18:45.220
And you look, and this is
how the cortex is wired up.

01:18:45.220 --> 01:18:47.810
It follows a power
law distribution.

01:18:47.810 --> 01:18:49.350
And what this
allows you to do is

01:18:49.350 --> 01:18:53.140
have clusters of stable,
functional interactions.

01:18:53.140 --> 01:18:56.370
But every now and then, you
can talk to somebody way

01:18:56.370 --> 01:19:00.120
over at the other end of the
cortex to see what's happening.

01:19:00.120 --> 01:19:01.460
Interesting finding.

01:19:01.460 --> 01:19:02.620
Autism.

01:19:02.620 --> 01:19:05.610
Autism, people have been looking
for what's up biologically.

01:19:05.610 --> 01:19:06.990
And the initial
assumptions would

01:19:06.990 --> 01:19:08.406
be, there's not
going to be enough

01:19:08.406 --> 01:19:10.070
neurons in some
part of the brain

01:19:10.070 --> 01:19:11.520
or maybe too many in another.

01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:13.290
What appears to
be the case so far

01:19:13.290 --> 01:19:15.560
is there's relatively
normal number

01:19:15.560 --> 01:19:17.530
of neurons in the cortex.

01:19:17.530 --> 01:19:21.210
But then some people started
studying the projection

01:19:21.210 --> 01:19:25.200
profiles of neurons in
the cortex of individuals

01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:26.630
with autism post-mortem.

01:19:26.630 --> 01:19:27.890
Very rare to get these.

01:19:27.890 --> 01:19:30.295
And you see a power
law distribution.

01:19:30.295 --> 01:19:33.040
But it's a different one.

01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:35.100
It's a steeper one.

01:19:35.100 --> 01:19:36.480
What does that mean?

01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:39.030
In the cortex of
autistic individuals,

01:19:39.030 --> 01:19:42.800
way more of the connections
are little local ones.

01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:45.640
There's far fewer of
the long-distance ones.

01:19:45.640 --> 01:19:47.150
There are way more local ones.

01:19:47.150 --> 01:19:48.770
What does that produce?

01:19:48.770 --> 01:19:52.260
Little pockets, little
modules of function

01:19:52.260 --> 01:19:55.250
that are isolated
from other ones.

01:19:55.250 --> 01:19:58.880
And that in some ways is
what's going on functionally

01:19:58.880 --> 01:20:00.080
in someone with autism.

01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:02.820
There is a lack of
integration of a whole bunch

01:20:02.820 --> 01:20:04.650
of these different
functions there.

01:20:04.650 --> 01:20:08.880
And that's what happens when you
have maybe a mutation or maybe

01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:11.660
some epigenetic something
or other prenatally that

01:20:11.660 --> 01:20:15.610
changes the shape of the
power law distribution.

01:20:15.610 --> 01:20:16.700
Interesting.

01:20:16.700 --> 01:20:19.980
There's a gender difference
in the power law distribution

01:20:19.980 --> 01:20:22.140
of wiring in the cortex.

01:20:22.140 --> 01:20:24.540
Which is, in the
typical female brain,

01:20:24.540 --> 01:20:26.940
if this is the power
law distribution.

01:20:26.940 --> 01:20:31.260
And in the male brain
it's a little steeper.

01:20:31.260 --> 01:20:34.770
Male brains are more
modular in their wiring.

01:20:34.770 --> 01:20:37.480
What's the biggest
part of the brain?

01:20:37.480 --> 01:20:39.243
OK, we're running
out of space here.

01:20:44.990 --> 01:20:45.600
There it is.

01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:47.390
There's the brain
in cross-section.

01:20:47.390 --> 01:20:50.260
And you've got cortex
here and cortex there.

01:20:50.260 --> 01:20:52.670
And famously, here's
all the cell bodies.

01:20:52.670 --> 01:20:55.840
And when projections are
going from one hemisphere

01:20:55.840 --> 01:21:00.690
to the other, it goes across
this huge bundle of axons

01:21:00.690 --> 01:21:03.180
called the corpus callosum.

01:21:03.180 --> 01:21:07.370
The corpus callosum is
thicker in women than in men,

01:21:07.370 --> 01:21:08.200
on the average.

01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:11.310
It is thicker in
females than in males

01:21:11.310 --> 01:21:13.970
because the power
law pattern is such

01:21:13.970 --> 01:21:16.840
that there are more
long-distance connections

01:21:16.840 --> 01:21:20.664
in female networks, and thus
it's a thicker corpus callosum.

01:21:20.664 --> 01:21:22.580
The same thing is playing
out with connections

01:21:22.580 --> 01:21:23.705
like this, and connections.

01:21:23.705 --> 01:21:25.690
But this is the big honker one.

01:21:25.690 --> 01:21:29.450
You get a thinner
corpus callosum in men.

01:21:29.450 --> 01:21:34.890
You get an even thinner corpus
callosum in people with autism.

01:21:34.890 --> 01:21:38.940
Again, that hyper male notion
there of Baron Cohen's.

01:21:38.940 --> 01:21:41.850
What you have here is a
perfectly normal number

01:21:41.850 --> 01:21:46.000
of neurons, probably even
perfectly normal number

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.030
of connections
between the neurons.

01:21:48.030 --> 01:21:49.790
But they're more
local, they're more

01:21:49.790 --> 01:21:53.110
isolated in the autistic cortex.

01:21:53.110 --> 01:21:55.310
There's less
integration of function.

01:21:55.310 --> 01:21:59.250
It's more isolated
islands of function there.

01:21:59.250 --> 01:21:59.960
OK.

01:21:59.960 --> 01:22:02.270
More examples of
where you can get

01:22:02.270 --> 01:22:04.120
sort of patterns coming out.

01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:09.300
Another version of it, which
is bottom-up quality control.

01:22:09.300 --> 01:22:12.950
You start a website, you
are selling some product,

01:22:12.950 --> 01:22:14.930
you are selling
books or whatever,

01:22:14.930 --> 01:22:17.730
and you're asking people
to rate the books.

01:22:17.730 --> 01:22:21.240
And you have a board of experts
that read all your books,

01:22:21.240 --> 01:22:24.030
and they're editors and they're
wise and they're learned.

01:22:24.030 --> 01:22:26.820
And they write your book
reviews and recommend

01:22:26.820 --> 01:22:28.890
which ones should be
bought and which ones not.

01:22:28.890 --> 01:22:31.290
And you get this very
successful business

01:22:31.290 --> 01:22:33.550
going so that you're selling
more and more different

01:22:33.550 --> 01:22:34.350
kinds of books.

01:22:34.350 --> 01:22:36.630
And as a result,
you need to hire

01:22:36.630 --> 01:22:38.650
more and more of these
experts to read the books

01:22:38.650 --> 01:22:40.530
and produce their ratings.

01:22:40.530 --> 01:22:43.320
And eventually that just
becomes too top heavy.

01:22:43.320 --> 01:22:44.490
And what do you do?

01:22:44.490 --> 01:22:46.700
The whole world that
we completely take for

01:22:46.700 --> 01:22:51.250
granted now, you have bottom-up,
bottom-up evaluations.

01:22:51.250 --> 01:22:53.160
Everybody rates things.

01:22:53.160 --> 01:22:57.660
And that's the world where you
punch in a book into Amazon

01:22:57.660 --> 01:23:00.210
or you look at something in
Netflix and when you return it,

01:23:00.210 --> 01:23:03.440
it will give you, people
who liked this movie tend

01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:05.240
to like these things as well.

01:23:05.240 --> 01:23:07.560
There are no critics,
professional critics,

01:23:07.560 --> 01:23:10.530
sitting there doing
top-down evaluations.

01:23:10.530 --> 01:23:13.400
This is another
realm of expressing

01:23:13.400 --> 01:23:15.660
attraction and repulsion rules.

01:23:15.660 --> 01:23:16.530
I liked this.

01:23:16.530 --> 01:23:17.880
I didn't like this.

01:23:17.880 --> 01:23:20.010
And all you need to
do, then, is throw

01:23:20.010 --> 01:23:22.880
in elements of
randomization, and you've

01:23:22.880 --> 01:23:25.650
got bottom-up quality control.

01:23:25.650 --> 01:23:28.040
And that's a completely
different way

01:23:28.040 --> 01:23:29.010
of doing these things.

01:23:29.010 --> 01:23:33.020
What's the greatest example
out there of bottom-up systems

01:23:33.020 --> 01:23:34.436
with quality control?

01:23:34.436 --> 01:23:36.160
Wikipedia.

01:23:36.160 --> 01:23:40.570
Wikipedia does not have
gray-bearded silverback elders

01:23:40.570 --> 01:23:43.350
there writing up the
Wikipedia knowledge

01:23:43.350 --> 01:23:45.580
and sending it on
down to everyone else.

01:23:45.580 --> 01:23:48.680
It is a bottom-up
self-correcting system.

01:23:48.680 --> 01:23:51.320
It is very easy to make
fun of some of the stuff

01:23:51.320 --> 01:23:53.780
that winds up in
Wikipedia, which is, like,

01:23:53.780 --> 01:23:55.460
wildly, insanely wrong.

01:23:55.460 --> 01:23:59.390
But when you get into areas
that are fairly hard nosed.

01:23:59.390 --> 01:24:01.950
Very interesting study
about five years ago

01:24:01.950 --> 01:24:05.260
that Nature commissioned, which
was getting a bunch of experts

01:24:05.260 --> 01:24:09.340
to look at Wikipedia and to look
at the Encyclopedia Britannica

01:24:09.340 --> 01:24:12.550
and look at the
hard-nosed facts in there

01:24:12.550 --> 01:24:15.160
about the physical
sciences, the life sciences.

01:24:15.160 --> 01:24:17.570
And what you got
was, Wikipedia was

01:24:17.570 --> 01:24:21.120
in hailing distance of the
Encyclopedia Britannica's

01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:22.730
level of accuracy.

01:24:22.730 --> 01:24:24.680
And that was five years ago.

01:24:24.680 --> 01:24:28.200
And it has five years of
self-organized correction

01:24:28.200 --> 01:24:29.230
since then.

01:24:29.230 --> 01:24:30.560
This is amazing.

01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:33.790
The Encyclopedia Britannica
is like written-- there's,

01:24:33.790 --> 01:24:38.730
like, 30, like, elderly, stuffed
British scholars that they,

01:24:38.730 --> 01:24:41.240
like, have locked
in a room for years

01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:42.980
who produced the encyclopedia.

01:24:42.980 --> 01:24:46.050
And these are the law
givers and the knowledge--

01:24:46.050 --> 01:24:48.120
And you just let a
whole bunch of people

01:24:48.120 --> 01:24:50.340
loose with somewhat
differing opinions

01:24:50.340 --> 01:24:55.360
about whether Madonna
was born in 1994 or 1987

01:24:55.360 --> 01:24:56.110
or whatever it is.

01:24:56.110 --> 01:24:58.110
And you throw them
all together and you

01:24:58.110 --> 01:24:59.730
do wisdom of the crowd stuff.

01:24:59.730 --> 01:25:04.320
And out comes a self-correcting,
accurate, adaptive system

01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:09.860
with no blueprint, just with
some very simple local rules.

01:25:09.860 --> 01:25:14.470
Very simple ones, which is
looking for similar patterns

01:25:14.470 --> 01:25:16.520
shared between
different individuals,

01:25:16.520 --> 01:25:17.480
and self-correcting.

01:25:17.480 --> 01:25:19.680
Where you get even
more efficient versions

01:25:19.680 --> 01:25:21.950
of that is with a
lot of websites,

01:25:21.950 --> 01:25:25.810
where not only does everybody
get to put in their opinion,

01:25:25.810 --> 01:25:28.300
but people whose
opinions are better

01:25:28.300 --> 01:25:32.590
rated have more of a voice
in evaluating somebody else.

01:25:32.590 --> 01:25:34.790
You're putting in
weighted wisdom

01:25:34.790 --> 01:25:36.800
of the crowd-type
functions in there,

01:25:36.800 --> 01:25:40.100
and out comes
incredible accuracy.

01:25:40.100 --> 01:25:40.950
These are great.

01:25:40.950 --> 01:25:44.000
There is one drawback with
those systems, though, which

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.145
is, with ones like
Netflix, where it tells you

01:25:46.145 --> 01:25:48.770
you're going to like this if you
like this, that sort of thing.

01:25:48.770 --> 01:25:51.910
It's a system that is very
biased towards conformity.

01:25:51.910 --> 01:25:56.060
It's not good at spotting
outliers and sort of taste

01:25:56.060 --> 01:25:56.700
and such.

01:25:56.700 --> 01:25:59.460
What you really want to
do in those systems is,

01:25:59.460 --> 01:26:03.200
here are the movies-- of the
movies that are out right now,

01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:06.200
here are the ones that have
10% of the people think

01:26:06.200 --> 01:26:08.080
it's the greatest
movie they've ever seen

01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:10.430
and 10% think it's
the worst movie.

01:26:10.430 --> 01:26:12.540
That's an interesting
movie to see.

01:26:12.540 --> 01:26:14.630
That's when you want
to be able to get

01:26:14.630 --> 01:26:18.830
a way of bottom-up information
about the extremes.

01:26:18.830 --> 01:26:20.930
Movies that generate
controversy.

01:26:20.930 --> 01:26:23.170
Everybody's going to
love whatever it is,

01:26:23.170 --> 01:26:24.800
and that doesn't
take a whole lot.

01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:27.480
This is a way to break the
potential for conformity

01:26:27.480 --> 01:26:29.090
in these bottom-up systems.

01:26:29.090 --> 01:26:33.100
Nonetheless, overall it
winds up solving a problem

01:26:33.100 --> 01:26:37.130
without professional
critics, without a blueprint,

01:26:37.130 --> 01:26:40.130
without top-down control.

01:26:40.130 --> 01:26:42.330
So how do you wire
some of these up?

01:26:42.330 --> 01:26:44.390
Back to the cortex.

01:26:44.390 --> 01:26:47.055
And the adult cortex has
these power law distributions,

01:26:47.055 --> 01:26:49.500
and they're great
because they optimize.

01:26:49.500 --> 01:26:51.850
They've got lots of stable,
local communication,

01:26:51.850 --> 01:26:53.620
but there's still
the ability to do

01:26:53.620 --> 01:26:55.940
creative long-distance
connections.

01:26:55.940 --> 01:26:58.010
So that's great.

01:26:58.010 --> 01:26:59.110
But how do you get that?

01:26:59.110 --> 01:27:01.640
How does the nervous
system wire up this way?

01:27:01.640 --> 01:27:04.180
And it does swarm intelligence.

01:27:04.180 --> 01:27:09.450
The developing cortex does a
swarm intelligence solution.

01:27:09.450 --> 01:27:13.780
When the cortex is
first developing,

01:27:13.780 --> 01:27:18.530
what you will have is a
first generation, a pioneer

01:27:18.530 --> 01:27:22.550
generation, a pioneer
generation of cells.

01:27:22.550 --> 01:27:27.440
The cortex surface, all of
that, that there is a pioneer

01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:30.380
generation of cells
that basically grow

01:27:30.380 --> 01:27:32.920
processes up like these.

01:27:32.920 --> 01:27:36.420
And these are called
radial glial cells.

01:27:36.420 --> 01:27:39.740
What they are, they're the
ants with the first generation

01:27:39.740 --> 01:27:41.710
of setting down the trail here.

01:27:41.710 --> 01:27:43.850
They're the first
bees coming in.

01:27:43.850 --> 01:27:46.160
And what you then
have, the neurons

01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:49.190
are the second-generation
random wanderers.

01:27:49.190 --> 01:27:50.830
And what they do
is they come in.

01:27:50.830 --> 01:27:52.540
And as they begin
to develop, they

01:27:52.540 --> 01:27:55.380
have rules that, when
they hit a radial glia,

01:27:55.380 --> 01:27:57.020
they grow up along it.

01:27:57.020 --> 01:27:59.510
They migrate along it,
they throw up connections.

01:27:59.510 --> 01:28:01.870
And you do that with
enough of the cortex, which

01:28:01.870 --> 01:28:05.600
is hundreds of millions of
billions of neurons in there,

01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:09.620
and you get optimal
power law distributions.

01:28:09.620 --> 01:28:13.230
All you need are some
very simple local rules.

01:28:13.230 --> 01:28:17.440
And out of that emerges
an optimally wired cortex.

01:28:17.440 --> 01:28:22.190
And it's the same simple
emergent stuff going on.

01:28:22.190 --> 01:28:23.000
OK.

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:26.420
So how do we begin to really
apply this stuff to humans?

01:28:26.420 --> 01:28:29.090
Because it winds up being
very pertinent and making

01:28:29.090 --> 01:28:31.690
sense of some of the most
interesting complex things

01:28:31.690 --> 01:28:32.820
about us.

01:28:32.820 --> 01:28:37.300
So what's the difference between
humans and every other species?

01:28:37.300 --> 01:28:39.200
Nothing all that exciting.

01:28:39.200 --> 01:28:41.490
From a neurobiological
standpoint,

01:28:41.490 --> 01:28:45.240
you've got this real challenge,
which is, you look at a neuron

01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:47.480
from a fruit fly
under a microscope

01:28:47.480 --> 01:28:49.927
and you look at one
from us and it's

01:28:49.927 --> 01:28:51.530
going to look kind of the same.

01:28:51.530 --> 01:28:53.410
Looking at a single
neuron, you can't tell

01:28:53.410 --> 01:28:54.990
which species it came from.

01:28:54.990 --> 01:28:58.020
We have the same kind
of neurotransmitters

01:28:58.020 --> 01:29:00.690
that a worm uses in
its nervous system.

01:29:00.690 --> 01:29:03.300
We've got the same
kind of ion channels,

01:29:03.300 --> 01:29:06.540
the same sort of excitability,
the same action potentials.

01:29:06.540 --> 01:29:08.500
You know, minor
details are different.

01:29:08.500 --> 01:29:11.350
We have not become
humans by inventing

01:29:11.350 --> 01:29:15.340
new types of brain cells and new
types of chemical messengers.

01:29:15.340 --> 01:29:18.490
We have the same basic
off-the-rack neuron

01:29:18.490 --> 01:29:20.220
that a fly does.

01:29:20.220 --> 01:29:21.150
Oh.

01:29:21.150 --> 01:29:25.200
We have very similar
basic building blocks.

01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:26.830
What's the
difference, of course,

01:29:26.830 --> 01:29:30.540
is we've got 100 million
of them for every neuron

01:29:30.540 --> 01:29:32.760
that you find in a fly brain.

01:29:32.760 --> 01:29:36.430
And out of that comes
emergent properties.

01:29:36.430 --> 01:29:37.630
Great story.

01:29:37.630 --> 01:29:39.550
Garry KAS-pah-rof,
kas-PAH-rof, I never

01:29:39.550 --> 01:29:42.290
remember which
syllable to emphasize.

01:29:42.290 --> 01:29:45.980
Grandmaster Russian, chess
grandmaster in the '90s.

01:29:45.980 --> 01:29:49.120
And apparently he's rated as one
of the strongest of all times.

01:29:49.120 --> 01:29:52.350
And he was the
person who wound up

01:29:52.350 --> 01:29:55.360
participating in this
really major event, which

01:29:55.360 --> 01:29:58.710
was this tournament with
this chess-playing computer

01:29:58.710 --> 01:30:04.209
that IBM had built called Deep
Blue or Big Blue or Old Yeller.

01:30:04.209 --> 01:30:05.000
What was it called?

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.620
Deep Blue, Deep Blue, Deep Blue.

01:30:07.620 --> 01:30:09.250
And they played
against each other.

01:30:09.250 --> 01:30:13.470
And apparently what happened
was, in the first game,

01:30:13.470 --> 01:30:15.780
Kasparov won perhaps.

01:30:15.780 --> 01:30:19.030
And the computer was able
to modify its strategy

01:30:19.030 --> 01:30:21.630
and then proceeded to
mop the floor with him.

01:30:21.630 --> 01:30:25.120
And this was a landmark
event in computer science.

01:30:25.120 --> 01:30:27.700
This was the first
time that a computer

01:30:27.700 --> 01:30:31.090
had beaten a chess grandmaster.

01:30:31.090 --> 01:30:33.000
Amazing event.

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:34.790
Not surprisingly,
afterward Kasparov

01:30:34.790 --> 01:30:36.590
is all bummed out and depressed.

01:30:36.590 --> 01:30:39.220
And his friends were trying
to make him feel better.

01:30:39.220 --> 01:30:43.210
And they go to him and they say,
look, all you got done in by

01:30:43.210 --> 01:30:44.520
is quantity.

01:30:44.520 --> 01:30:46.370
All you got done
in by is the fact

01:30:46.370 --> 01:30:48.530
that that computer could
do a whole lot more

01:30:48.530 --> 01:30:52.040
computations than you could
in a set amount of time.

01:30:52.040 --> 01:30:54.720
I'm told, apparently
chess grandmaster types

01:30:54.720 --> 01:30:57.024
can see five, six moves ahead.

01:30:57.024 --> 01:30:59.190
And they can intuit where
the interesting ones were.

01:30:59.190 --> 01:31:03.840
And Deep Blue could calculate
every single possible outcome,

01:31:03.840 --> 01:31:05.747
like, seven, eight
moves in advance.

01:31:05.747 --> 01:31:07.580
And every time, it would
simply pick the one

01:31:07.580 --> 01:31:08.850
that was the best outcome.

01:31:08.850 --> 01:31:12.160
It was like generating solutions
to the traveling salesman

01:31:12.160 --> 01:31:12.920
problem.

01:31:12.920 --> 01:31:16.090
Kasparov didn't have a
chance because the computer

01:31:16.090 --> 01:31:18.850
could simply generate
enough solutions

01:31:18.850 --> 01:31:20.400
to pick the right one.

01:31:20.400 --> 01:31:21.950
So all of them
are saying to him,

01:31:21.950 --> 01:31:24.850
you should not be depressed
because all that computer had

01:31:24.850 --> 01:31:27.180
going for it was quantity.

01:31:27.180 --> 01:31:29.030
And what he said
in response was,

01:31:29.030 --> 01:31:33.520
yeah, but with enough
quantity you invent quality.

01:31:33.520 --> 01:31:35.890
And that's the exact
equivalent of one ant

01:31:35.890 --> 01:31:38.570
makes no sense and 10,000 do.

01:31:38.570 --> 01:31:41.180
That's the exact equivalent,
with enough of these elements

01:31:41.180 --> 01:31:42.510
here, you optimize.

01:31:42.510 --> 01:31:44.610
We do not have
fancy neurons that

01:31:44.610 --> 01:31:46.690
are different than
in any other species.

01:31:46.690 --> 01:31:48.500
We've just got more of them.

01:31:48.500 --> 01:31:52.800
And simple nearest neighbor
rules, and you throw a million

01:31:52.800 --> 01:31:54.760
of them together and
you get a fruit fly.

01:31:54.760 --> 01:31:56.640
And you throw 100
billion of them together

01:31:56.640 --> 01:32:00.030
and you get poetry and you get
symphonies and you get theology

01:32:00.030 --> 01:32:01.180
and you get all of that.

01:32:01.180 --> 01:32:03.520
And it's the same
building blocks.

01:32:03.520 --> 01:32:07.070
With enough quantity,
you invent quality.

01:32:07.070 --> 01:32:09.310
And this is the punch
line that came out

01:32:09.310 --> 01:32:11.710
of really important
work a few years ago.

01:32:11.710 --> 01:32:14.830
OK, we're now, what, 10
years, I think, into having

01:32:14.830 --> 01:32:16.620
the human genome sequenced.

01:32:16.620 --> 01:32:20.850
And about five years ago they
sequenced the chimp genome.

01:32:20.850 --> 01:32:21.660
Soundbite.

01:32:21.660 --> 01:32:23.280
Everybody learned
from whenever back

01:32:23.280 --> 01:32:27.340
when is that the human and
chimp share 98% of its DNA.

01:32:27.340 --> 01:32:32.030
So finally you had these two
gigantic rolls of print-out.

01:32:32.030 --> 01:32:33.940
And here is the
entire human genome

01:32:33.940 --> 01:32:35.530
and here's the entire chimp one.

01:32:35.530 --> 01:32:37.430
And somebody could
finally sit there

01:32:37.430 --> 01:32:40.520
and compare them and compare
them and see, indeed,

01:32:40.520 --> 01:32:42.260
is it 98% shared?

01:32:42.260 --> 01:32:43.730
And that winds up
being the answer,

01:32:43.730 --> 01:32:46.620
even though what that number
actually means is debatable.

01:32:46.620 --> 01:32:51.250
But that brings up the question,
of course, what's the 2%?

01:32:51.250 --> 01:32:53.900
What's the 2% that differs?

01:32:53.900 --> 01:32:57.351
And what has come out of that
have been some very interesting

01:32:57.351 --> 01:32:57.850
findings.

01:32:57.850 --> 01:32:59.980
Some that were
mentioned earlier on,

01:32:59.980 --> 01:33:01.890
which is, they are
disproportionately

01:33:01.890 --> 01:33:06.610
coding for transcription
factors and splicing enzymes

01:33:06.610 --> 01:33:10.290
and, OK, that amplification
of network stuff.

01:33:10.290 --> 01:33:15.980
It is preferentially coding for
non-coding regions, differing

01:33:15.980 --> 01:33:18.130
but non-- all the
stuff from back,

01:33:18.130 --> 01:33:21.160
that lecture for getting
macroevolutionary changes.

01:33:21.160 --> 01:33:23.520
That's how you get a
different species coming out.

01:33:23.520 --> 01:33:25.650
But how about other
types of genes?

01:33:25.650 --> 01:33:27.580
What were some of
the key differences?

01:33:27.580 --> 01:33:30.090
Here was one big difference.

01:33:30.090 --> 01:33:34.230
We have about 1,000 fewer genes
for our olfactory receptors

01:33:34.230 --> 01:33:35.730
than chimps do.

01:33:35.730 --> 01:33:37.900
They've been inactivated in us.

01:33:37.900 --> 01:33:39.820
They're called
pseudogenes in us.

01:33:39.820 --> 01:33:41.000
They don't express.

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:44.250
And that's about half of
the difference in the genome

01:33:44.250 --> 01:33:45.880
between humans and chimps.

01:33:45.880 --> 01:33:47.880
If you want to turn
a chimp into a human,

01:33:47.880 --> 01:33:51.200
you're halfway there if you just
give it a lousy sense of smell.

01:33:51.200 --> 01:33:53.720
That's half the
genetic differences?

01:33:53.720 --> 01:33:55.270
What other
differences are there?

01:33:55.270 --> 01:33:58.860
There were ones having to
do with morphology, bone

01:33:58.860 --> 01:34:01.850
development, probably
bipedalism versus being

01:34:01.850 --> 01:34:03.160
a partial quadruped.

01:34:03.160 --> 01:34:05.840
There are ones having to do
with hair development, which

01:34:05.840 --> 01:34:08.380
is why chimps have all the
hair on them and only those,

01:34:08.380 --> 01:34:11.260
like, disturbing people with
the hair on their shoulders

01:34:11.260 --> 01:34:12.370
have that much hair.

01:34:12.370 --> 01:34:15.480
So that's-- there's differences
in some reproductive-related

01:34:15.480 --> 01:34:16.014
genes.

01:34:16.014 --> 01:34:17.930
You don't want to mate
with them, all of that.

01:34:17.930 --> 01:34:20.520
And then you say,
where's the genes

01:34:20.520 --> 01:34:22.040
having to do with the brain?

01:34:22.040 --> 01:34:23.780
Are there any differences there?

01:34:23.780 --> 01:34:27.090
And there turned out
to be very, very few.

01:34:27.090 --> 01:34:31.080
And they turned out to
be very, very logical.

01:34:31.080 --> 01:34:34.270
The handful that differ
seem to have something

01:34:34.270 --> 01:34:38.180
to do with cell division.

01:34:38.180 --> 01:34:42.840
Have something to do with how
many rounds of cell division

01:34:42.840 --> 01:34:44.880
these cells go through.

01:34:44.880 --> 01:34:47.570
And what you have is,
the human versions

01:34:47.570 --> 01:34:50.160
go through more rounds.

01:34:50.160 --> 01:34:52.240
And calculations have
been done looking

01:34:52.240 --> 01:34:54.730
at the average number of
neurons that each progenitor

01:34:54.730 --> 01:34:57.280
cell generates, say, during
cortical development.

01:34:57.280 --> 01:34:59.230
And if you start with
the number of neurons

01:34:59.230 --> 01:35:01.690
that you find in a
rhesus monkey brain

01:35:01.690 --> 01:35:05.530
and have it do three or four
more rounds of cell division,

01:35:05.530 --> 01:35:08.910
you get a human brain
in terms of the numbers.

01:35:08.910 --> 01:35:12.800
Qualitatively, it's
the exact same neurons.

01:35:12.800 --> 01:35:14.480
All that differs is quantity.

01:35:14.480 --> 01:35:16.390
And you put enough
of these together

01:35:16.390 --> 01:35:18.410
and you go from
tools, which are meant

01:35:18.410 --> 01:35:21.950
to get little termites
out, into human technology,

01:35:21.950 --> 01:35:25.230
the difference between us
and them is one of quantity.

01:35:25.230 --> 01:35:28.760
Throw enough neurons in
there, and out begins

01:35:28.760 --> 01:35:32.930
emerging all these
distinctive human things.

01:35:32.930 --> 01:35:35.070
So what does that do?

01:35:35.070 --> 01:35:37.010
That begins to, for
one thing, underline

01:35:37.010 --> 01:35:39.490
what the main genetics
are about in terms

01:35:39.490 --> 01:35:41.660
of the genetic differences
in the brain between us

01:35:41.660 --> 01:35:44.500
and, say, chimps are
genes that free you

01:35:44.500 --> 01:35:46.440
from genetic influences.

01:35:46.440 --> 01:35:50.537
Because those are not
specifying what sort of cells

01:35:50.537 --> 01:35:52.370
you generate in larger
numbers in the brain.

01:35:52.370 --> 01:35:54.290
They're not specifying
connections.

01:35:54.290 --> 01:35:56.720
They're just specifying
larger quantity.

01:35:56.720 --> 01:36:01.130
And all this stuff goes to work
and out comes a human brain

01:36:01.130 --> 01:36:03.280
instead of a chimp one.

01:36:03.280 --> 01:36:05.230
OK, so what does this
whole subject get us?

01:36:05.230 --> 01:36:08.620
The chaos stuff, the
complexity emergent stuff.

01:36:08.620 --> 01:36:11.700
What are some of the themes that
come through with all of it?

01:36:11.700 --> 01:36:15.080
The first one is this
emphasis on quantity.

01:36:15.080 --> 01:36:17.760
You want to get a very,
very fancy system.

01:36:17.760 --> 01:36:21.770
You don't necessarily have
to invent a new type of ant

01:36:21.770 --> 01:36:25.230
or a new type of 0 or
1 in a binary system

01:36:25.230 --> 01:36:27.250
or a new type of neuron.

01:36:27.250 --> 01:36:29.150
You could do it with quantity.

01:36:29.150 --> 01:36:32.700
You get quality, you get
excellence, you get complexity,

01:36:32.700 --> 01:36:37.190
you get adaptive optimization
with huge numbers of elements

01:36:37.190 --> 01:36:39.290
with the very simple rules.

01:36:39.290 --> 01:36:41.160
What's the next theme
that comes out of it?

01:36:41.160 --> 01:36:43.990
One that is totally
counterintuitive.

01:36:43.990 --> 01:36:45.760
Once again, like
this whole subject

01:36:45.760 --> 01:36:48.140
that shoots reductionism
down the drain,

01:36:48.140 --> 01:36:49.830
totally counterintuitive.

01:36:49.830 --> 01:36:55.120
The simpler the constituent
parts, the better.

01:36:55.120 --> 01:36:58.450
Fancy, complicated ants that
are specialized and have

01:36:58.450 --> 01:37:00.040
all sorts of different rules.

01:37:00.040 --> 01:37:02.810
They are not going to
generate swarm intelligence

01:37:02.810 --> 01:37:07.340
as effectively as do systems
with the simpler elements.

01:37:07.340 --> 01:37:10.780
The more simple the building
blocks are, the better.

01:37:10.780 --> 01:37:12.940
Something else that
is intrinsic to all

01:37:12.940 --> 01:37:14.880
of this, which runs
counter to all sorts

01:37:14.880 --> 01:37:19.310
of rational intuitions, which
is more random interactions

01:37:19.310 --> 01:37:21.680
make for better, more
adaptive networks.

01:37:21.680 --> 01:37:24.710
You want lots of
random noise thrown

01:37:24.710 --> 01:37:28.660
in there because that's how you
stumble onto optimal solutions.

01:37:28.660 --> 01:37:31.130
Randomness is a good thing.

01:37:31.130 --> 01:37:34.560
And remember, right at the time
that we're making new neurons

01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:38.350
in the cortex, that's when you
induce the transposable events

01:37:38.350 --> 01:37:39.370
in the genome.

01:37:39.370 --> 01:37:43.900
That's where you juggle the
DNA producing randomness there.

01:37:43.900 --> 01:37:45.790
Randomness is a good thing.

01:37:45.790 --> 01:37:49.520
Randomness adds to the
excellence of networks

01:37:49.520 --> 01:37:50.490
What else?

01:37:50.490 --> 01:37:52.620
Next thing as a theme
that comes out of it

01:37:52.620 --> 01:37:57.100
is the power of
gradients of information.

01:37:57.100 --> 01:38:00.960
Things that guide you,
you a cell, you an ant,

01:38:00.960 --> 01:38:03.510
you a commercial district.

01:38:03.510 --> 01:38:05.890
Things that can guide
you towards things,

01:38:05.890 --> 01:38:08.530
things that can
repel you, gradients

01:38:08.530 --> 01:38:10.932
of attraction and repulsion.

01:38:10.932 --> 01:38:12.390
And that's exactly
what's going on.

01:38:12.390 --> 01:38:14.750
There is a gradient
in magnets when

01:38:14.750 --> 01:38:18.060
they're this close and the power
that they have is dropping off.

01:38:18.060 --> 01:38:20.670
As they move,
gradients provide a lot

01:38:20.670 --> 01:38:23.530
of the optimization
in these systems.

01:38:23.530 --> 01:38:28.030
Very, very important as well is
nearest neighbor interactions.

01:38:28.030 --> 01:38:30.420
These are not just a
handful of simple rules

01:38:30.420 --> 01:38:33.250
about how you're interacting
with somebody in Chicago.

01:38:33.250 --> 01:38:36.610
These are all how you
interact with another ant,

01:38:36.610 --> 01:38:40.400
another bee when you bump
into it, a glial cell.

01:38:40.400 --> 01:38:43.830
Local interactions
with simple rules.

01:38:43.830 --> 01:38:44.820
Something else.

01:38:44.820 --> 01:38:47.030
Another one that
runs totally counter

01:38:47.030 --> 01:38:49.930
to intuition, which
is generalists

01:38:49.930 --> 01:38:53.740
work better in these
systems than specialists do.

01:38:53.740 --> 01:38:56.470
Generalists are more
likely to come up

01:38:56.470 --> 01:38:59.380
with these adaptive outcomes.

01:38:59.380 --> 01:39:02.730
OK, so what does all of
this mean on a larger level?

01:39:02.730 --> 01:39:06.350
And what I think is
that this is where

01:39:06.350 --> 01:39:09.460
the complexity of human brains
and human behaviors come from,

01:39:09.460 --> 01:39:11.340
these emergent properties.

01:39:11.340 --> 01:39:14.130
And this is now a generation
or two into people

01:39:14.130 --> 01:39:15.750
thinking about this stuff.

01:39:15.750 --> 01:39:19.040
And it is incredibly
hard to think about.

01:39:19.040 --> 01:39:21.700
And most of the work
I do and my peers do

01:39:21.700 --> 01:39:24.170
is reductive stuff
that is very limited.

01:39:24.170 --> 01:39:26.770
And like, I don't
understand how to think

01:39:26.770 --> 01:39:28.040
about it in this other way.

01:39:28.040 --> 01:39:30.020
And the odds are,
you guys are not

01:39:30.020 --> 01:39:31.990
going to be good
enough at it either.

01:39:31.990 --> 01:39:35.610
You're good enough that you were
a first generation growing up

01:39:35.610 --> 01:39:37.540
that knows, if you
want to find out

01:39:37.540 --> 01:39:39.200
if you're going to
like a movie or not,

01:39:39.200 --> 01:39:42.330
you don't need to have
somebody with expertise

01:39:42.330 --> 01:39:45.720
and a label on their forehead
and a blueprint and top down.

01:39:45.720 --> 01:39:47.330
You don't need critics anymore.

01:39:47.330 --> 01:39:49.170
You have bottom-up systems.

01:39:49.170 --> 01:39:51.620
You guys who are first
generation growing up

01:39:51.620 --> 01:39:53.520
thinking in that way.

01:39:53.520 --> 01:39:55.400
What's a consequence of that?

01:39:55.400 --> 01:39:57.660
You are beginning to get
better at this stuff.

01:39:57.660 --> 01:40:00.872
And my guess is, it's not
until, like, your grandkids

01:40:00.872 --> 01:40:02.580
that you're going to
have people thinking

01:40:02.580 --> 01:40:05.340
so much in the emergent
systems that we're finally

01:40:05.340 --> 01:40:07.910
going to be able to figure
out what the brain is doing.

01:40:07.910 --> 01:40:10.570
And where you see
there is all sorts

01:40:10.570 --> 01:40:12.280
of things that can happen.

01:40:12.280 --> 01:40:14.860
If there was more
bottom-up communication

01:40:14.860 --> 01:40:16.890
in the trenches in
World War I, they

01:40:16.890 --> 01:40:18.530
would have stopped the war.

01:40:18.530 --> 01:40:20.970
All these emergent
things bottom up.

01:40:20.970 --> 01:40:24.480
We've now had
revolutions when Marcos

01:40:24.480 --> 01:40:25.970
was overthrown in
the Philippines

01:40:25.970 --> 01:40:28.310
back when that was
basically bloodless.

01:40:28.310 --> 01:40:29.970
When the Czech
revolution occurred,

01:40:29.970 --> 01:40:31.580
it was called the
Velvet Revolution

01:40:31.580 --> 01:40:33.410
because there was no violence.

01:40:33.410 --> 01:40:36.220
All they had to do was get
enough people in the town

01:40:36.220 --> 01:40:39.430
square in the capital
and paralyze the country,

01:40:39.430 --> 01:40:40.950
and they took it over.

01:40:40.950 --> 01:40:43.730
I will predict that
within our lifetime

01:40:43.730 --> 01:40:45.330
there is going to
be a revolution

01:40:45.330 --> 01:40:47.800
in some country at
some point where nobody

01:40:47.800 --> 01:40:49.540
leaves their living rooms.

01:40:49.540 --> 01:40:52.380
All they do is do
something online

01:40:52.380 --> 01:40:54.690
with some emergent
bottom-up thing

01:40:54.690 --> 01:40:58.610
and they collapse the government
and do it in and no one

01:40:58.610 --> 01:41:01.270
will have to leave their
living room because it will be

01:41:01.270 --> 01:41:03.670
all emergent things coming up.

01:41:03.670 --> 01:41:05.650
The final couple of points here.

01:41:05.650 --> 01:41:10.060
First one is, all that chaotic,
strange, attractor stuff, all

01:41:10.060 --> 01:41:12.360
of us spend a lot
of time thinking

01:41:12.360 --> 01:41:16.570
about how we're not quite
up to the ideal this or not.

01:41:16.570 --> 01:41:18.750
We're not at the
ideal appearance.

01:41:18.750 --> 01:41:20.250
We're not at the
ideal intelligence.

01:41:20.250 --> 01:41:22.140
We're not at the ideal
choice of perfume.

01:41:22.140 --> 01:41:23.590
We're not at the ideal anything.

01:41:23.590 --> 01:41:25.815
What strange attractors
and chaos shows

01:41:25.815 --> 01:41:28.800
you is the notion that
there is an ideal,

01:41:28.800 --> 01:41:32.750
that there is an essentialist
optimal, whatever, is a myth.

01:41:32.750 --> 01:41:35.590
We are all deviating
from the optima

01:41:35.590 --> 01:41:39.670
because the optima is just
an emergent, imaginary thing.

01:41:39.670 --> 01:41:42.600
The other final point is,
something that you guys are

01:41:42.600 --> 01:41:45.670
going to be much better at
than any previous generation,

01:41:45.670 --> 01:41:47.450
which, if you grow
up thinking, when

01:41:47.450 --> 01:41:49.590
I want to find out if
a movie is good or not,

01:41:49.590 --> 01:41:53.550
I do bottom-up stuff, you
are growing up with a mindset

01:41:53.550 --> 01:41:55.970
that you don't need blueprints.

01:41:55.970 --> 01:41:59.150
You don't need
top-down blueprints.

01:41:59.150 --> 01:42:01.680
And implicit in
that, when you look

01:42:01.680 --> 01:42:05.820
at how you can get complex,
adaptive, optimized systems

01:42:05.820 --> 01:42:08.140
without blueprints is
the fact that, if you

01:42:08.140 --> 01:42:10.820
don't need blueprints,
you don't need somebody

01:42:10.820 --> 01:42:12.610
who makes the blueprints.

01:42:12.610 --> 01:42:15.090
And it will be a lot
easier to comprehend that

01:42:15.090 --> 01:42:16.410
as being the case.

01:42:16.410 --> 01:42:20.900
You don't have to have a
source of top-down instruction

01:42:20.900 --> 01:42:22.747
if you don't need a blueprint.

01:42:22.747 --> 01:42:23.580
OK, so I don't know.

01:42:23.580 --> 01:42:25.470
I'm talking about something--

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:08.050
Stanford University.

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:08.800
Let's get started.

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:18.080
We switch to our next subject,
where the overall plan

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.540
could be summarized
like that, as you well

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.030
know by now-- looking
at the language,

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:26.610
looking at the biological
roots of the interactions

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.360
with the environment,
all the deal

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.590
that we have under
our belts by now.

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.220
Same strategy as usual,
starting off with the behavior,

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.280
and then working our way back.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.430
First off, two announcements
before I forget.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.160
One is we're not going to
have a lecture on depression.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.460
The remaining lectures will
be Wednesday schizophrenia,

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.980
Friday is biology of religion,
and the following Wednesday

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.240
is the final lecture
personality disorders

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.840
individual differences.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.960
And apropos of that, not
positive at the moment,

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.020
but I'm leaning towards
the last two lectures

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.170
not being taped for
a number of reasons.

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.740
OK, also one final
point from Wednesday,

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.350
from Friday's lecture,
the complexity one,

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.450
back to that business, swarm
intelligence, and being

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.090
able to solve the traveling
salesman problem for you

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.140
with remarkable efficiency,
that business again

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.740
about how the cortex wires
up that two generation

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.420
business of cells,
the first cells being

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.100
those radial glia
that established

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.900
sort of a super structure,
the second generation

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.080
then being the neurons that
do the random laundering, hit

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.060
and grow up there, and then
wire up in these optimal nodes.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.250
What you also get is a version
intrinsic in that it is solving

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.330
the traveling salesman problem.

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.990
If you think about
it, if you've got

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.990
20, 30 billion cortical
neurons there, and all of them

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.730
are wiring up to
10,000 other neurons,

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.440
depending on how
efficiently you pack it,

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.050
you could have a hundred
gazillion miles of axons

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.940
that you have to grow, or just
a couple of kilometers worth.

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.770
And, again, the pressure is
to come up with the traveling

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.340
salesman efficiency to be
able to pull off the wiring

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.790
that you want with the minimal
amount of expenditure of axons.

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.800
And what you see when
you look at the way

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.000
the cortex does wire
up people working

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.920
on this showing remarkably
efficient solutions coming out

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.980
of that brain's equivalent
of doing swarm intelligence.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.880
So language, starting off with
our usual strategy-- starting

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.170
off with what the
behaviors look like.

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.230
And the place to
begin is with some

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.190
of the universals of language.

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.040
Across all the different human
languages, approximately 6,000

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.900
of them, and all sorts
of depressing news

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.200
about that to come.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.570
First off, something that
they all have in common

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.160
is semanticity-- the
notion that there

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.000
is an endless array,
an infinite array,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.270
of sounds that could
be generated by voices.

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.750
And what all languages do is
bucket them, as per usual,

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.400
break up this continuum of
sounds into units of meaning,

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.960
and where meaning corresponds
to the unit itself.

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.180
The notion of that
being a pair of people

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.850
we'll more about later--
Marc Hauser, Noam Chomsky,

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.990
pointing out that even
though you could generate

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:25.050
an infinite number of words, you
could never generate 6.5 words.

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.560
That's part of what
semanticity is about.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.810
Not only do you break
continuum of sounds

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.210
into buckets of meaning.

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:34.430
But they are discrete buckets.

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.290
You cannot have partial words.

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.110
Also, what else is
universal to languages?

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.990
The possibility of
embedded clauses.

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.700
And ones that get
considerably more complicated,

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.850
all languages not
only have a can do b.

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.260
But they all have a
under this condition,

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.750
but not under that condition,
and sometimes on Tuesdays

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.380
but never on Thursdays can do b.

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.460
All of them will
have embedded clauses

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.020
like that, that
being a universal.

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:03.320
What else?

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.620
All of them show
recursion, which

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.540
is a really important property.

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.700
Old term for it would be
something like generativity,

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.880
which is all languages have
a finite number of words.

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.140
And all languages
have the potential

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:21.089
to generate an infinite
number of combinations.

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:23.810
And all you have to
do see that is come up

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.070
with what you believe
is the longest sentence

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.330
in all of history.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.550
And all you have to do is put
at the beginning of it Bill said

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.590
that, blah, blah.

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.100
And once that's
there, then you have

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.460
to have Jane said
that Bill said that.

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.195
And, thus, you have an
infinite generativity.

00:04:41.195 --> 00:04:43.700
All languages, finite
number of words,

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.860
infinite number of combinations.

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:46.680
What else?

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.230
Very important feature
of human language

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:52.500
when we get to comparing it
with animal communication--

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.890
displacement.

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:56.800
We can talk about
stuff from the past.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.330
We can talk about
stuff from the future.

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.540
We can talk about stuff on
the other side of the planet.

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.710
We can talk about
things that are

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.180
emotionally distant from us.

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.100
And as we'll see with animals,
the overwhelming majority

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:13.490
of animal communication
is about emotion.

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:14.350
I am upset.

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:15.100
I am angry.

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.850
I am afraid.

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:16.520
I am horny.

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:17.180
I am hungry.

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.450
I am whatever it is.

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:22.130
Humans, instead, can talk
about chess strategies--

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:25.070
displacement,
displacement from emotion.

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:29.460
Related to that, there's
arbitrariness of language.

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:30.870
What do I mean by this?

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:33.330
In virtually any
animal species that

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.850
is communicating, for example,
I am terrified out of my mind,

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:40.600
it's going to involve something
resembling that species'

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:45.130
equivalent of screaming and
emoting loudly, and saying,

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:47.330
ah, or some equivalent of that.

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:51.530
We are able to say, I am
feeling a deeply corrosive sense

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:53.770
of disquietude at the moment.

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:57.990
We don't have the actual
words being tied inextricably

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:59.200
into their meaning.

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.510
You cannot look
at a word and say,

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:05.131
whoa that word has an awful lot
of right angles in the letters

00:06:05.131 --> 00:06:05.630
there.

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:07.810
It must be a word that
tells you something

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:10.790
about this type of philosophy.

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:14.330
It's arbitrary relationship
between the signal

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:15.700
and the message.

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:18.170
And that is universal
to human languages.

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:19.730
What else is universal?

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:23.310
The ability to have this
lecture, meta communication,

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:25.990
to communicate
about communication,

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:28.920
to be able to step
back from language

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:30.800
and discuss it in and of itself.

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.760
And one extreme version
of it is to have

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:37.320
people who devote their
times to inventing language.

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:44.680
Two examples-- one is the French
have some national institution

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.580
which is meant to save
the French language

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:48.660
from the sullying
effects of words

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:50.440
from all sorts of
other languages.

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.100
And they make all
sorts of rulings

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:55.024
as to what words are now
allowed to become French.

00:06:55.024 --> 00:06:58.500
And I don't know what they
decided about le Big Mac,

00:06:58.500 --> 00:06:59.550
whether that came in.

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:03.170
But this is a body that
studies and decides what words

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:04.990
should be part of its language.

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:08.220
Similarly, there is a
college in Washington DC

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:11.920
called Gallaudet College,
which is for deaf individuals.

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:15.620
And it's ground zero for
American Sign Language.

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:19.930
It's the place where some band
of sign language elder poobahs

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:24.240
sit around and decide on
new words in that language.

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:26.450
As we'll see, that's not
a very effective strategy.

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:29.650
But nonetheless, that
is meta communication.

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:33.450
Every single language has the
ability to talk about language.

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:36.190
Every single language
and its practitioners

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:39.990
use motherese, use baby talk.

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:44.160
Baby talk where typically the
mother, but not exclusively so,

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:47.640
will speak to a child
in a high-pitched voice

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:50.940
emphasizing melodic and
vowel aspects of it,

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:55.680
repeating phrases, focusing very
closely in on the baby's face.

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:58.670
All of these languages
have motherese.

00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:01.680
And the question becomes,
is motherese about emotion,

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.310
or is it about instruction?

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:07.330
And what you see is some real
similarities between motherese

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:10.090
and how people often
talk to their pets.

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:12.830
And you're usually not
trying to teach your pets how

00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:15.310
to speak your native language.

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:17.750
One difference,
though, with speaking

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:21.530
to pets you get the repetitive,
high-pitched voice stuff.

00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:23.830
You don't get the close clarity.

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:27.170
You do not make a point
of making the sound slowly

00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:28.150
and clearly.

00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:30.880
You are not teaching
your dog language there.

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:32.220
So that is a difference.

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:36.909
Nonetheless, in every single
language, you get motherese.

00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:38.294
Next, you have
what's going to be

00:08:38.294 --> 00:08:39.919
an issue throughout
when trying to make

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:41.304
sense of the biology of this.

00:08:41.304 --> 00:08:42.720
When we're looking
at what's going

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:44.730
on in the brain in
that sort of thing,

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:47.320
is language in those
cases what you're

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:50.400
doing with your lips,
your larynx, your throat?

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:53.420
Is the language mostly
about the motoric aspects?

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:56.650
This is a system involving
the generation of sound

00:08:56.650 --> 00:08:58.150
and the reception of sound.

00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:00.170
Or is it more about cognition?

00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:03.060
Is it more about the
conceptual structure?

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:04.530
And the general
view in the field

00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:07.460
is it's overwhelmingly
about the latter.

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:09.910
And some of the strongest
evidence for that

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:13.320
comes from sign languages--
American Sign Language.

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:18.200
American Sign Language, which
shows all sorts of very subtle,

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:21.840
deep properties that are
similar to spoken language

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.060
amid it not being
a spoken language,

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:27.620
and amid using completely
different systems in the brain.

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:31.720
One example of this-- you
look at babies who are born

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:34.920
deaf and will be learning
American Sign Language.

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:38.460
And right around the age
that hearing infants begin

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:41.530
to babble with their
spoken language,

00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:45.330
deaf babies begin to babble
in American Sign Language,

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:47.620
and are starting to
make signs with that.

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:51.160
Just like hearing babies, they
tend to babble that most people

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:52.400
before going to sleep.

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:53.780
It's the same property.

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:56.160
There is not a rule
that says, somewhere

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:58.670
around nine months
of age, begin making

00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:01.840
sounds that are fragments of
stuff you've been hearing.

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:03.810
Somewhere around
nine months of age,

00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:07.730
begin to practice fragments of
whatever communicative system

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:10.200
you are being exposed to.

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:12.520
Similar evidence
that language is

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:14.530
about the cognitive
structure and not

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:18.280
about lips and tongue--
when older individuals who

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:20.970
are native speakers of
American Sign Language

00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:24.780
happen to have a stroke, they
can get the exact same sort

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:29.080
of communication
disorders in sign language

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:30.637
that speaking individuals do.

00:10:30.637 --> 00:10:32.470
And we'll see that in
more detail, what some

00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:34.140
of these pathologies look like.

00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:38.650
It's coded for in very
similar parts of the brain.

00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:41.380
Both spoken language
and sign language

00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:44.720
have something called prosody,
which we will hear more about.

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:47.510
Prosody is not the
words in a language.

00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:52.090
Prosody is the tone, what you're
doing with your face, what

00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:55.120
you're doing with your hands,
the gestures, your body

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:58.230
posture, all the things
that are communicated

00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:00.570
through those routes
there, all the things

00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:03.040
which virtually by
definition-- email,

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:06.230
you can't do prosody with,
beyond little smiley face

00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:06.800
things.

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:08.840
That's about the
limits of prosody.

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:11.820
You find prosody in
American Sign Language,

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:14.660
people doing very different
facial expressions.

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:17.390
One classic example
of sign language

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:20.840
prosody is if somebody
in American Sign Language

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:24.360
is describing a conversation
between two people they will

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:28.450
subtly shift their body as
they're going from one person

00:11:28.450 --> 00:11:29.660
to the other there.

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:30.730
This is prosody.

00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:32.720
This is reinforcing
the information.

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:36.890
This is a dialogue that this
is exactly what spoken language

00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:39.310
people do in terms
of that prosody,

00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:42.520
the same thing in
American Sign Language.

00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:46.600
Next, amazing bit of evidence
from ASL-- American Sign

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:50.500
Language-- that this is about
cognition, not about lips

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:53.160
and tongue of what makes
it a language, which is you

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:55.610
look at someone
who is born deaf,

00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:58.530
and where ASL is
their native language.

00:11:58.530 --> 00:12:00.940
And when you are
signing to them,

00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:05.990
their auditory cortex
activates, the same regions

00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:10.780
that do some of the initial
processing of hearing language.

00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:14.020
Again, it's about the
deep concepts within.

00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:15.120
It

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:19.440
More evidence-- you get accents
in American Sign Language.

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:22.980
And, apparently, this
consists of different speeds,

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:25.000
slurring, that sort of thing.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.320
And there's regional
accents in ASL.

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:29.710
And I have no idea if
it matches in some ways

00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:31.900
the accents of the
spoken English there.

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:35.110
My guess is no, but
you have accents there.

00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:38.740
You have poetry in American
Sign Language, where

00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:42.490
you will have a sign that
is some movement followed

00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:43.930
by this movement.

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:45.840
And I'm obviously
just making this up.

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:47.970
And then you can
have this movement

00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:49.440
followed by the same movement.

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:51.520
That counts as rhyming words.

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:54.540
You get poetry in
American Sign Language.

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:58.870
And you get storage of
American Sign Language when

00:12:58.870 --> 00:13:02.150
it is a second language in
the same sorts of regions

00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:06.290
of the cortex as when people
get a second spoken language.

00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:09.390
This is not merely
about languages what

00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:11.440
you do with sounds and hearing.

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:14.220
Language is, instead, about
the underlying cognitive

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:15.240
structures.

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:18.600
OK, cool thing, if you ever
start learning American Sign

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:21.130
Language, almost certainly
somewhere on the first day

00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:24.092
they're going to show you what a
cool language it is by teaching

00:13:24.092 --> 00:13:25.050
you the following word.

00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:26.260
This is always
the first word you

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.090
need to learn in
American Sign Language.

00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:30.800
OK just to show you
building blocks of it,

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:33.650
this is the word for milk.

00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:37.320
OK, you can kind of see some
iconic stuff going on there, as

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:38.550
to this means milk.

00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:41.792
So what does this word mean
in American Sign Language?

00:13:41.792 --> 00:13:43.640
Pasteurized milk.

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:45.229
Who said that?

00:13:45.229 --> 00:13:45.895
How do you know?

00:13:45.895 --> 00:13:47.374
Do you know it already?

00:13:47.374 --> 00:13:48.990
It's his favorite joke.

00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:50.110
Oh my God.

00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:53.350
How's that-- identical
twins separated at birth.

00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:56.230
Do you flush the
toilet before you go?

00:13:56.230 --> 00:14:02.320
OK, yes, giving it away,
past your eyes milk, oh, oh.

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:03.210
Can you believe that?

00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:05.700
You better guess the folks
at that Gallaudet College

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:07.700
went out and celebrated
the rest of the day when

00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:09.490
somebody came up with that one.

00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:13.680
Yes, you can have puns in
American Sign Language.

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:17.000
Yeah, it's you and me there
with the pasteurized milk sign.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.880
Yes, the very first thing
you learn in most cases.

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:21.240
This is a real language.

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:22.310
You have emotion.

00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:23.640
You have physical prosody.

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:24.770
You have accents.

00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:25.700
You have puns.

00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:26.970
You have a poetry.

00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:29.620
And it's got nothing to
do with lips and tongue.

00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:31.110
And as we'll see
more and more here

00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:34.970
about the neurobiology of it, it
will be more and more evidence

00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:35.890
for that.

00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:39.310
Thus, we now shift over
to the neurobiology.

00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:42.850
What's going on in the brain,
in terms of language production,

00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:44.320
language comprehension?

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:48.000
Right off the bat, there is
this sort of irritating debate

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.750
that goes on in the field, which
is how modular of a function

00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:54.760
is language in the brain?

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:57.450
Which is another way of
saying neurobiologically,

00:14:57.450 --> 00:15:00.260
how fancy and
separate is language

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:03.690
from the rest of the cognitive
stuff that the cortex does?

00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:05.640
And what we
certainly just argued

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:09.840
with ASL is insofar as
language might be a relatively

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:12.700
isolated module, it's
sure not a module

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:15.350
that's very concerned
about tongues and ears.

00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:17.100
It's about the
cognitive elements.

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:21.290
How different are
the cortical devices

00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:23.500
devoted to making
sense of language,

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:25.340
different from the
other cortical regions?

00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:27.180
And at one extreme,
there's a view

00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:31.070
that talks about the cortex, the
brain, as a Swiss army knife,

00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:34.030
that it has all these separate
little functions, language

00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:37.620
being one of the most
isolated, identifiable ones.

00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:40.140
My sense-- and I
know next to nothing

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:43.170
about it-- is that this
argument doesn't stand up.

00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:45.250
Here's the two things
that people always

00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:48.190
cite when discussing
how much is language

00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:50.950
a cortically modular function.

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:53.630
First one is the disease we
heard about the other week,

00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:55.330
that Williams Syndrome.

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:58.160
And that's that strange
genetic disorder of you

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:03.010
have these kids who are
wildly verbal, and expressive,

00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:06.765
and warm, and affectionate,
and have that weird vasopressin

00:16:06.765 --> 00:16:09.990
oxytocin world
going on with them.

00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:12.960
They're extremely
adept with language.

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:17.150
Yet, they typically have IQs in
the borderline retarded range,

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:19.160
around 70 or so.

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:22.900
Whoa, how can you have
functional language

00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:24.940
amid everything
else being a mess?

00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:28.470
This is an argument for
language as a distinct module.

00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:32.240
Conversely, you have things
called specific language

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:35.540
impairments, which are also
heritable disorders where

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:38.690
you have individuals, where you
have pedigrees, where people

00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:42.330
have a huge amount
of time producing

00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:44.300
language,
comprehending language.

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:46.230
And this is not
sensory problems.

00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:49.570
This is people having
perfectly normal IQs--

00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:52.170
oo, separate module.

00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:55.680
The arguments that both Williams
and the selective language

00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:58.470
impairment disorders
argue for a module

00:16:58.470 --> 00:17:00.520
breaks down with
the fact that when

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:02.930
you look at language
and the Williams kids,

00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:06.930
they're very fluent, and
very generative of words.

00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:09.619
But there's not a huge
amount of meaning in there.

00:17:09.619 --> 00:17:12.410
And, likewise, the people
with the specific language

00:17:12.410 --> 00:17:14.190
impairments, it's
turning out it's

00:17:14.190 --> 00:17:17.760
usually not in the normal IQ
range in these individuals.

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:21.760
So I think, generally, there's
this pretty strong argument

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:24.276
against language
being a strict module.

00:17:24.276 --> 00:17:26.859
Nonetheless, people who actually
think about this for a living

00:17:26.859 --> 00:17:30.320
as opposed to spout off, this
is a very, very controversial

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:31.620
issue.

00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:34.510
More, the next most
characteristic thing

00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:38.850
about the neurobiology of
language is it's lateralized.

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:42.370
Lateralization of brain
function-- the notion

00:17:42.370 --> 00:17:45.570
that somewhere in your
cortex, your cortex

00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:47.030
could be doing
something or other,

00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:50.480
and it turns out that it will
only do that something or other

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:52.190
on one side of your brain.

00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:55.480
There will be specializations
on different sides of the brain.

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:57.520
That goes back to last Friday.

00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:00.700
That's one of the ways you gotta
solve the traveling salesman

00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:01.390
problem.

00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:04.090
If you have these massive
numbers of neurons

00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:08.200
in the cortex, you gotta
start inventing lateralization

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:10.290
to save yourself some axons.

00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:12.940
And it's not until you
get to monkeys and apes

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:16.520
that you see substantial
amounts of lateralization.

00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:19.630
Human brain lateralization
for language

00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:22.480
is probably the most
distinctive lateralization

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:25.530
we've got other than handedness.

00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:29.100
And for that, we begin to
look at the relevant brain

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:30.870
regions going on here.

00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:34.240
How, first, do you see that
brain regions, that language

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:36.100
production, language
comprehension,

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:39.340
is carried out by only
one side of the brain?

00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:42.670
Our usual, ever-reliable
research technique,

00:18:42.670 --> 00:18:46.270
which is getting people whose
heads are damaged in accidents

00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:49.800
or warfare and seeing, you get
damage on one side of the head

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:53.010
and people are far more likely
to get language problems

00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:54.440
afterward than the other.

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:58.910
What turns out to be the
case is about 90% of people

00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:02.740
have language lateralization to
the left side of their brain.

00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:05.860
As we'll see, not so
fast, it's not that clean.

00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:08.730
But nonetheless, you
begin to see that.

00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:10.710
Another test,
another way of seeing

00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:13.180
that which is considerably
more subtle than somebody

00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:17.460
getting their head bashed in, is
something called the WADA test.

00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:20.200
The WADA test where,
weirdly enough,

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:23.830
you anesthetize one half
of somebody's brain.

00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:27.340
You infuse anesthetic
into one of the carotids.

00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:30.110
And you put one
hemisphere to sleep.

00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:32.270
And what you see is you
do it on the left side.

00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:35.430
And most people, they lose
their language production.

00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:39.050
And you do it on the other side,
and other stuff disappears.

00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:41.990
Whoa, that must be a fun
thing to do at parties.

00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:43.270
When does this happen?

00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:45.470
First off, it is very brief.

00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:48.650
It lasts for only a few minutes
or so until the anesthetic

00:19:48.650 --> 00:19:49.460
clears.

00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:53.400
But what you do that for is in
circumstances where somebody

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:55.760
has intractable epilepsy.

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:58.150
And they're good to
go in and cut out

00:19:58.150 --> 00:20:00.150
part of the cortex
in cases where

00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:02.730
it is cortically localized.

00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:05.680
And if it's near what might
be the language center

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:07.160
of the brain, they go in.

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:09.930
And they do a WADA
test first to see,

00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:13.720
is this person doing language
on left side or right side?

00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:16.230
If it's the side where
we're doing the surgery,

00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:18.474
we've got to be that
much more conservative

00:20:18.474 --> 00:20:20.640
in terms of getting this
out, getting the tumor out,

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:21.567
whatever.

00:20:21.567 --> 00:20:23.150
It gives you a sense
of whether that's

00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:24.830
going for the language center.

00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:27.032
And what you do is the
person is sitting there.

00:20:27.032 --> 00:20:28.490
And they're supposed
to be reading.

00:20:28.490 --> 00:20:30.669
Or you're reciting
something to them.

00:20:30.669 --> 00:20:32.460
And they're supposed
to be writing it down,

00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:34.560
or some such a language-y thing.

00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:37.980
And you infuse a barbiturate
into one carotid.

00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:40.840
And, suddenly, 10 seconds
later, they can't speak.

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:42.890
Or they're not
understanding language.

00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:45.250
And you've now
identified that that's

00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:48.350
the side with the
language lateralization.

00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:48.960
I'm not sure.

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:51.040
But my guess would
be that the WADA test

00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:53.830
is going to disappear soon
because you could do it just

00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:55.070
with brain imaging.

00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:56.570
You look at someone.

00:20:56.570 --> 00:20:59.460
You give them some sort of
linguistic something or other.

00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:03.490
And if one side of the cortex
activates preferentially

00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:05.630
in the areas we're
about to hear about,

00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:08.400
you've just identified the side.

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:11.490
So the relevant
areas-- very broadly,

00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:14.980
there are three regions in
the brain, the cortex, that

00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:17.510
are most pertinent to language.

00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:21.200
First one is called
Broca's area.

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:25.100
Broca's area, which is sitting
on the cortex in a region

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:27.430
called the parietal lobe.

00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:31.770
And simply what it is is
it's the bottommost part

00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:36.180
of the strip of the cortex
that does motoric stuff, moving

00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:37.260
your body.

00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:39.230
And by the time you're
getting down here,

00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:41.810
what this is about
is moving your lips,

00:21:41.810 --> 00:21:44.950
moving your larynx,
language production.

00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:47.540
We've already seen it's not
just going to be about that.

00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:51.190
If people with American Sign
Language get a stroke here,

00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:53.440
and they get problems
producing this.

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:56.190
But, nonetheless, on
the first crude pass,

00:21:56.190 --> 00:22:00.540
it's the part of the cortex
devoted to motoric regulation

00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:04.390
of lips, tongues, throat,
larynx, et cetera.

00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:06.920
So what happens when
you get damage there?

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:09.240
General term, an aphasia.

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:12.300
Aphasia is the broad
neurological term

00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:15.610
for being unable to
communicate effectively

00:22:15.610 --> 00:22:18.450
because of a neurological hit.

00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:23.050
You get a Broca's aphasia,
a production aphasia.

00:22:23.050 --> 00:22:26.420
This is someone who now
has a great deal of trouble

00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:30.960
generating meaningful
words, meaningful messages.

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:32.990
It comes out haltingly.

00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:35.980
The actual content
can be quite impaired.

00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:40.400
Amid them, being relatively
good at comprehending.

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:42.720
Then just south of
there, you've got

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:46.670
this area called Wernicke's
area, again named

00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:49.080
for famous poo-ba in that area.

00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:53.250
And this is right near some
primary auditory cortex.

00:22:53.250 --> 00:22:54.890
What's Wernicke's about?

00:22:54.890 --> 00:22:58.630
Of course, obviously it's
about language comprehension.

00:22:58.630 --> 00:23:01.310
And you get someone with
stroke damage to there,

00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:03.330
you get a Wernicke's aphasia.

00:23:03.330 --> 00:23:07.770
And you get someone who just is
fluidly generating of language

00:23:07.770 --> 00:23:09.390
they can't comprehend.

00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:11.290
They can't comprehend
directions.

00:23:11.290 --> 00:23:13.250
Put your right
hand on your left,

00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:14.840
whatever, that sort of thing.

00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:17.780
But what you also see
is they're very fluidly

00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:21.130
generating language that often
makes no sense whatsoever

00:23:21.130 --> 00:23:22.720
because they are
not comprehending

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:24.510
anything spoken around them.

00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:29.500
They produce what is
often called a vegetable

00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:32.130
salad, a language salad.

00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:34.720
Somebody knows?

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:37.410
Word salad, yes.

00:23:37.410 --> 00:23:39.382
OK, you guys come
down teach this.

00:23:39.382 --> 00:23:41.340
I'm going to go back
there and check my emails.

00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:46.160
OK, so word salad-- so you got
Wernicke's, you got Broca's.

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:48.520
You got Wernicke's
aphasias, Broca's aphasias.

00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:53.520
And then you've got this
area, the arcuate fasciculus,

00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:56.380
which was not named for somebody
named arcuate fasciculus.

00:23:56.380 --> 00:24:01.010
But it's the bundle, it's the
set, of projections, the axons,

00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:03.780
connecting Wernicke's
with Broca's.

00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:05.260
So what's that about?

00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:07.970
It's about connecting
comprehension

00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:10.110
to language production.

00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:14.530
In theory, if you had an
absolutely pure wiping out

00:24:14.530 --> 00:24:18.580
of the arcuate fasciculus, and
both these guys were completely

00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:22.160
intact, you would get
somebody who could completely

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:23.320
understand language.

00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:26.120
You could give them complex
instructions, what to do.

00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:27.520
They would be able to follow it.

00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:31.620
This would be somebody who could
produce language perfectly, say

00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:33.050
anything they want to.

00:24:33.050 --> 00:24:36.880
This would be someone
who is incapable of going

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:40.100
from Wernicke's
comprehension to production.

00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:43.160
You could not successfully
say to the person,

00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:45.320
say the word cat.

00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:49.711
They could not connect this
auditory command to production

00:24:49.711 --> 00:24:50.210
there.

00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:53.780
So that would be a pure
arcuate fasciculus damage.

00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:57.320
Not surprisingly, you
hardly ever see anybody

00:24:57.320 --> 00:25:00.740
with stroke damage causing
an aphasia where it's cleanly

00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:02.330
only in one of these areas.

00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:04.930
Almost everyone
who gets an aphasia

00:25:04.930 --> 00:25:08.450
has some sort of a mixed
Broca's, Wernicke's connection

00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:10.340
conduction aphasia there.

00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:12.340
It's always a mess.

00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:15.020
And in the past, but I don't
think we have time for it this

00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:18.820
year, I would bring in a tape to
listen to a number of different

00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:21.830
types of individuals with
aphasias post-stroke,

00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:25.010
hearing a relatively pure
Broca's, a relatively pure

00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:26.070
Wernicke's.

00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:27.820
But those are quite rare.

00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:31.350
OK, so those are some of
the relevant brain regions.

00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:36.340
Production, what you've
got there is motoric stuff.

00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:39.660
OK, so back to--
we've just defined

00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:41.760
that this is the
part of the brain

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:44.440
having to do with your lips and
tongues, and this deal again.

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:45.670
This is about hearing.

00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:48.250
So what about
people who are deaf,

00:25:48.250 --> 00:25:50.670
born deaf, with
American Sign Language?

00:25:50.670 --> 00:25:52.600
These are the
areas that light up

00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:54.610
when they are
hearing, when they are

00:25:54.610 --> 00:25:58.130
seeing, when they are being
spoken to in American Sign

00:25:58.130 --> 00:25:59.170
Language.

00:25:59.170 --> 00:26:01.760
This is the area,
Broca's, that activates

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:03.290
when they are communicating.

00:26:03.290 --> 00:26:06.530
What you've done here
is hijacked-- you know,

00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:08.500
this is traditionally
about tongues, and lips,

00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:09.225
and all of that.

00:26:09.225 --> 00:26:13.150
But we can hijack it for a
very symbolic way of doing

00:26:13.150 --> 00:26:14.840
the same sort of cognitions.

00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:17.320
Yeah, this part of the
brain is for somebody

00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:19.030
sticking a pin in your finger.

00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:22.560
But it's been hijacked to
feeling the world's pain.

00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:27.140
It's making use of new ways that
we're doing stuff here, just

00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:29.250
jamming it into old sites.

00:26:29.250 --> 00:26:31.850
You're going to try to
communicate using your hands.

00:26:31.850 --> 00:26:34.120
And, suddenly,
you're going to have

00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:36.730
to make use of some of
these spoken regions

00:26:36.730 --> 00:26:39.630
there if you don't speak
a language, so that.

00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:45.150
More examples of how ASL is
about the content rather than

00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:48.760
the motoric aspects-- take
someone who is speaking.

00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:51.790
And they're having to recite
a bunch of words quickly.

00:26:51.790 --> 00:26:53.600
And you're checking
them for accuracy.

00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:55.620
And you give them a
distractor that they

00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:57.260
have to do at the same time.

00:26:57.260 --> 00:27:00.551
They have to tap their feet,
their left foot, three times,

00:27:00.551 --> 00:27:02.300
and once on the right,
three times, once--

00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:05.734
and your performance gets
screwed up at that point.

00:27:05.734 --> 00:27:08.150
It's not as accurate, because
you're also paying attention

00:27:08.150 --> 00:27:09.030
to this.

00:27:09.030 --> 00:27:11.730
Now do the same thing with
someone with American Sign

00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:12.230
Language.

00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:14.300
Give them the same
foot distractor.

00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:16.950
If American Sign
Language is heavily

00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:20.750
about it's just stuff you're
doing with your hands,

00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:24.220
it's just another way of
communicating spoken language,

00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:27.070
all it's really about is
tongues, and lips, and throat.

00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:29.820
American Sign Language, what
it's about is motoric stuff.

00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:33.590
If it's motoric, it should
be screwed up by this task

00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:36.600
to a greater extent than people
that are messed up when they're

00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:38.230
using a spoken language.

00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:40.990
It's messed up to the
exact same extent.

00:27:40.990 --> 00:27:42.750
The pertinent thing
about this is not

00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:44.290
what you're doing
with your muscles.

00:27:44.290 --> 00:27:46.390
It's the same
cognitive structures

00:27:46.390 --> 00:27:49.720
that you're tapping into
with the spoken language.

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:55.410
Finally, in that realm, there is
some weirdo whistling language

00:27:55.410 --> 00:27:58.356
that's used on some island
in the Canary Islands

00:27:58.356 --> 00:28:00.230
that people have been
whistling at each other

00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:02.770
and at their sheep for
centuries and centuries.

00:28:02.770 --> 00:28:05.040
And, apparently,
it actually fits

00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:08.450
some of the profiles of
what a true language is.

00:28:08.450 --> 00:28:10.860
There's a very complex
structure to it.

00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:13.000
And what you've
seen in one study

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.660
so far is when people
are producing it,

00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:17.960
they're lighting up here.

00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:20.850
When they were hearing it,
they're lighting up Wernicke's.

00:28:20.850 --> 00:28:24.330
Again, basic off the
rack hominid for a long,

00:28:24.330 --> 00:28:27.870
long time, this is about
ears, this is about tongues.

00:28:27.870 --> 00:28:31.230
And, instead, it's about
the abstract, the symbolic,

00:28:31.230 --> 00:28:33.650
elements of language.

00:28:33.650 --> 00:28:35.820
Demonstrating that
further, depending

00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:38.190
on where you get
the stroke damage,

00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:42.080
there's this whole world
of bizarre aphasias,

00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:44.865
or disorders of communication.

00:28:44.865 --> 00:28:46.250
You get alexias.

00:28:46.250 --> 00:28:50.150
You get agraphias-- people
who can speak, can comprehend,

00:28:50.150 --> 00:28:51.090
can read.

00:28:51.090 --> 00:28:53.390
They simply cannot
write anymore.

00:28:53.390 --> 00:28:55.030
People who can do
all those things,

00:28:55.030 --> 00:28:56.990
they simply can't read anymore.

00:28:56.990 --> 00:29:01.760
People who lose the capacity
to recognize certain letters,

00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:04.150
certain types of words, gerunds.

00:29:04.150 --> 00:29:06.240
There's some gerund
aphasia out there,

00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:08.820
whatever a gerund is,
which I once knew.

00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:11.575
You get all these sorts
of specializations

00:29:11.575 --> 00:29:15.770
by having far smaller strokes,
all these subroutines.

00:29:15.770 --> 00:29:18.210
Apparently, there has
been at least one case

00:29:18.210 --> 00:29:22.080
of an elderly sailor
who had a stroke, who

00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:24.020
had learned semaphores,
which I guess

00:29:24.020 --> 00:29:26.230
was some big thing in
World War II or something,

00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:28.750
and had a semaphore aphasia.

00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:32.320
This is not a very common
hominid event to have happened.

00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:34.600
This is all the different ways.

00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:36.010
This is lips, ears.

00:29:36.010 --> 00:29:37.310
It's reading.

00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:38.715
it's writing.

00:29:38.715 --> 00:29:40.360
It's semaphores.

00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:41.200
It's pantomime.

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:42.410
It's who knows what.

00:29:42.410 --> 00:29:45.750
It's much, much more
abstract than that.

00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:49.330
OK, so you've got
the left cortex,

00:29:49.330 --> 00:29:50.410
with its specialization.

00:29:50.410 --> 00:29:55.200
In 90% of cases, you get
slightly different localization

00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:59.160
of Wernicke's and Broca's, in
particular the areas related

00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:01.820
to reading when you
have a language which

00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:04.910
instead of an alphabet
is a pictograph language.

00:30:04.910 --> 00:30:07.675
For example, Chinese,
a pictograph language,

00:30:07.675 --> 00:30:12.240
you get slightly different
areas of activation, and thus

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:14.420
slightly different
areas of strokes

00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:21.210
will produce a Chinese
Broca's aphasia, or an alexia,

00:30:21.210 --> 00:30:22.460
that sort of thing.

00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:25.640
Doing language as pictures,
as opposed to doing language

00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:27.880
of building blocks of
individual letters,

00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:31.280
slightly localized
differently in the brain.

00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:34.610
So the brain is completely
devoting its energy

00:30:34.610 --> 00:30:37.870
on the left side to
language in 90% of people.

00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:40.580
Lateralized, you don't have
a Broca's or a Wernicke's

00:30:40.580 --> 00:30:41.670
on the right side.

00:30:41.670 --> 00:30:45.100
Destroy the equivalent areas,
you do nothing to language.

00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:49.440
Cut through the brain in cross
section, and on this side

00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:52.200
the cortex will be
a little bit thicker

00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:55.650
than the cortex on the right
side, the equivalent area.

00:30:55.650 --> 00:30:59.540
So language is all about
the left hemisphere.

00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:01.940
So, of course, this is
not true, because you

00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:05.350
get the prosody stuff
in the right hemisphere.

00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:09.040
That's where you get the
coding for tone of voice.

00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:10.680
That's the part of
the brain that's

00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:12.590
telling you if the
person is having

00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:16.220
a sarcastic tone in their
voice when they're saying that.

00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:20.450
That's the area that's picking
up on facial expressions, body

00:31:20.450 --> 00:31:21.090
language.

00:31:21.090 --> 00:31:24.970
All of that is right
hemisphere in 90% of people.

00:31:24.970 --> 00:31:27.560
And what you see
is stroke damage,

00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:30.710
you can get prosody
disorders as well.

00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:33.942
People are perfectly normal in
their auditory comprehension,

00:31:33.942 --> 00:31:35.650
their reading, writing,
their production,

00:31:35.650 --> 00:31:36.730
all that sort of stuff.

00:31:36.730 --> 00:31:40.680
But they can't understand
context of spoken language

00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:44.720
from body posture, from tone
of voice, things of that sort.

00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:49.930
So you can have prosody
damage, right cortex.

00:31:49.930 --> 00:31:53.480
Next, more pertinent
areas in the brain--

00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:57.200
a subcortical region
called the basal ganglia.

00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:59.940
What's the basal ganglia about?

00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:04.345
It tells a lot of your
muscles what to do.

00:32:04.345 --> 00:32:07.220
And, for example, when
your frontal cortex

00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:10.610
has finished wrestling with
all the limbic regions,

00:32:10.610 --> 00:32:15.100
a lot of what the outcome is, is
activation of the basal ganglia

00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:16.620
making you do something.

00:32:16.620 --> 00:32:20.050
Oh, go do the harder but right
thing, that sort of thing.

00:32:20.050 --> 00:32:23.550
Basal ganglia is
about motor stuff.

00:32:23.550 --> 00:32:25.946
OK, duh, this is not surprising.

00:32:25.946 --> 00:32:27.320
This is not terribly
interesting.

00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:30.140
Obviously, language
involves motoric stuff,

00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:32.980
whether it's spoken, whether
it's signed, whatever.

00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:35.140
So, obviously, the
parts of the brain

00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:37.590
that generate relevant
muscle movement,

00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:40.120
they're going to get activated,
also they're involved.

00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:43.940
Just a couple of things that
makes this basal ganglia more

00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:46.970
interesting, though, which
is the next time you're

00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:50.370
talking on the phone or watching
somebody talk on the phone,

00:32:50.370 --> 00:32:54.280
see the frequency with which
they're making hand gestures.

00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:56.980
You're hand gesturing
under those circumstances.

00:32:56.980 --> 00:32:59.900
You're hand gesturing
to your GPS system

00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:01.350
when it's talking to you.

00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:04.000
You're hand gesturing in
all sorts of circumstances

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:07.480
where there is no visual
communication going on.

00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:11.760
Blind individuals, when they
are speaking to each other use

00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:15.220
the same sorts of hand gestures
as seeing individuals do.

00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:18.400
It's not just, OK, we've got to
get the basal ganglia in here

00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:20.150
because we've got to
do something or other

00:33:20.150 --> 00:33:21.730
with our jaw and our lips.

00:33:21.730 --> 00:33:25.250
Something about the
emotiveness is centrally

00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:27.670
tied into the motoric output.

00:33:27.670 --> 00:33:30.750
Because it's impossible
to talk on the phone

00:33:30.750 --> 00:33:33.320
and not to be gesturing
with your hands.

00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:35.320
If you're talking
about anything that's

00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:38.720
at all sort of activated,
or aroused, or emotional,

00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:40.460
your hands are going like crazy.

00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:42.550
And it makes no sense.

00:33:42.550 --> 00:33:46.690
The basal ganglia is really
central to all of this.

00:33:46.690 --> 00:33:50.320
Next, finally, in terms
of a brain structure,

00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:52.650
the rest of the limbic system.

00:33:52.650 --> 00:33:54.310
Totally clear what
that one's going

00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:56.870
to be about, which is
the limbic system has

00:33:56.870 --> 00:33:58.360
nothing to do with language.

00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:00.970
The limbic system has to do
with screaming your head off

00:34:00.970 --> 00:34:02.190
if you're terrified.

00:34:02.190 --> 00:34:04.590
The limbic system has
to do with singing.

00:34:04.590 --> 00:34:06.390
The limbic system,
it's emotional.

00:34:06.390 --> 00:34:08.659
It's got nothing to
do with, OK, let's

00:34:08.659 --> 00:34:12.360
embed a clause here now in
order to express some emotion.

00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:15.920
And what you see is, initially,
a nice clean dichotomy

00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:16.520
with that.

00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:19.230
And a remarkable
thing you will see.

00:34:19.230 --> 00:34:21.550
So somebody has had a stroke.

00:34:21.550 --> 00:34:23.250
And they've got a
Broca's aphasia,

00:34:23.250 --> 00:34:25.750
which is to say they're
having a production aphasia.

00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:29.420
It is really next to
impossible for them to speak.

00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:30.659
It is halting.

00:34:30.659 --> 00:34:31.670
It is broken.

00:34:31.670 --> 00:34:33.100
They can't get the words.

00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:35.199
It is insanely frustrating.

00:34:35.199 --> 00:34:38.020
And one of the things
that speech therapists do

00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:42.699
is get people to sing what
it is they're trying to say,

00:34:42.699 --> 00:34:45.159
because if you make
sort of a running leap

00:34:45.159 --> 00:34:48.620
there and start singing it
before you think about, oh,

00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:53.690
here I am singing the
menu at the restaurant

00:34:53.690 --> 00:34:56.400
for the customers here,
before you start doing that,

00:34:56.400 --> 00:35:00.220
if you can jump quickly into it,
people with Broca's production

00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:04.700
aphasias can sing, often,
what they want to communicate

00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:08.700
because they are sending it
down south subcortically,

00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:12.340
and looping it through
limbic language areas,

00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:15.770
sort of marinating it in
some emotional content--

00:35:15.770 --> 00:35:19.050
music in this case--
and out it comes.

00:35:19.050 --> 00:35:21.390
Not surprisingly,
accuracy is not

00:35:21.390 --> 00:35:23.270
so hot under those
circumstances.

00:35:23.270 --> 00:35:27.030
But it's a lot better than when
you've got the Broca's aphasia

00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:29.220
not being able to speak at all.

00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:31.300
So that's pretty interesting.

00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:34.910
Next thing that suggests that
the limbic system has something

00:35:34.910 --> 00:35:36.560
central to do with
language, you look

00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:38.760
at people with
Tourette's disease, which

00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:40.910
we're going to hear a
lot about on Wednesday.

00:35:40.910 --> 00:35:43.170
And Tourette's
disease, everybody

00:35:43.170 --> 00:35:45.210
knows what Tourette's
disease is about.

00:35:45.210 --> 00:35:48.670
It's the disease where
you curse uncontrollably.

00:35:48.670 --> 00:35:51.650
As we'll see, there's much
more going on than that.

00:35:51.650 --> 00:35:55.070
But cursing, it's all
about limbic stuff.

00:35:55.070 --> 00:35:57.770
Tourette's is
involving not problems

00:35:57.770 --> 00:36:02.000
with Broca's cortical
regions generating cursing.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.840
It's about limbic hyperactivity,
and all sorts of other realms.

00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:08.130
So limbic system
having all sorts

00:36:08.130 --> 00:36:11.880
of access to your
language production.

00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:14.260
Another realm in which
there is clearly,

00:36:14.260 --> 00:36:16.660
the second you think
about it, an intersection

00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:21.680
between your cold, machine-like,
analytical cortical regions

00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:24.530
doing symbolic language
production comprehension

00:36:24.530 --> 00:36:26.840
for you, and your
emotional limbic world,

00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:30.220
this remarkable
phenomenon of you

00:36:30.220 --> 00:36:32.720
can feel better
when you are upset

00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:37.160
about something as a result
of talking to someone.

00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:39.580
Psychotherapy is
completely built

00:36:39.580 --> 00:36:43.030
around the notion that
there are very deep,

00:36:43.030 --> 00:36:47.400
fundamental connections
between one's language world

00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:49.380
and one's limbic one.

00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:51.000
So, again, this is
doing in the notion

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.790
not only that all
language is about is

00:36:53.790 --> 00:36:56.950
motoric aspects of generating
language, and auditory.

00:36:56.950 --> 00:36:59.770
It's about the deep,
cognitive structures.

00:36:59.770 --> 00:37:03.220
It's also not some cold,
cognitive task there.

00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:06.920
It is highly intertwined
with limbic structures.

00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:09.180
As you would thus
expect, studies

00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:12.020
showing that if you,
for example, stimulate

00:37:12.020 --> 00:37:15.020
some subcortical
regions in individuals

00:37:15.020 --> 00:37:17.360
as part of, again,
neurosurgery, trying

00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:20.114
to figure out where
a tumor is, stimulate

00:37:20.114 --> 00:37:21.030
some of those regions.

00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:25.070
And people will say
emotionally loaded things.

00:37:25.070 --> 00:37:28.300
They will say something
very emotionally expressive,

00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:30.010
positive, negative, whatever.

00:37:30.010 --> 00:37:31.680
Stimulate some of
the same regions,

00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:34.900
say, in a rhesus monkey, and
it will give a threat call.

00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:36.150
It will give an alarm call.

00:37:36.150 --> 00:37:37.960
It will give a solicitive call.

00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:40.320
It will express
something emotive.

00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:42.940
So the limbic
system has all sorts

00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:46.110
of ways in which it's talking
to these cortical regions.

00:37:46.110 --> 00:37:48.410
And, not surprisingly,
it's got lots

00:37:48.410 --> 00:37:51.450
of ways of talking
to the porosity areas

00:37:51.450 --> 00:37:53.600
in the right
hemisphere, since that's

00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:55.640
where a lot of the
emotional expressivity

00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:57.780
is coming through--
not in the words,

00:37:57.780 --> 00:38:00.660
but in the tone of voice,
the facial expressions,

00:38:00.660 --> 00:38:02.490
all of that.

00:38:02.490 --> 00:38:07.720
So neurobiology, now looking
at it in a taxonomic context--

00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:09.020
other species.

00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:11.540
Everyone would have
guessed up until people

00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:13.450
actually went and
looked that we're

00:38:13.450 --> 00:38:16.730
the only folks with a Broca,
with a Wernicke's area,

00:38:16.730 --> 00:38:18.830
that this is a human
specialization.

00:38:18.830 --> 00:38:22.080
And what you see is that's
pretty much the case.

00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:26.060
But you see the starts of it
in a number of primate species,

00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:29.580
a number of apes, and
chimps, and orangutans

00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:33.670
In rhesus monkeys, what you
see is the cortical thickening

00:38:33.670 --> 00:38:37.190
just on one side
corresponding to this area,

00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:40.460
not as thickened as in the human
brain in the left hemisphere.

00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:43.850
But nonetheless, you get
thickening like that.

00:38:43.850 --> 00:38:46.570
Moreover, how's this
for interesting-- OK,

00:38:46.570 --> 00:38:49.620
does everybody know
the factoid that it's

00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:51.154
the left side of
your brain that's

00:38:51.154 --> 00:38:53.320
telling the right side of
your body to do something,

00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:54.861
and it's the right
side of your brain

00:38:54.861 --> 00:38:58.210
that's crosswiring,
whatever it is it does?

00:38:58.210 --> 00:39:02.920
OK, get a monkey
who is vocalizing.

00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:05.610
And while it is vocalizing
something communicative,

00:39:05.610 --> 00:39:07.870
while it is doing
that, if it is doing

00:39:07.870 --> 00:39:10.110
any sort of facial
expressions, it's

00:39:10.110 --> 00:39:13.030
more pronounced on the
right side of the face.

00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:15.000
If it's doing something
with its arms,

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.105
it's more likely to
be the right arm.

00:39:17.105 --> 00:39:20.590
In other words, generating
the vocalization

00:39:20.590 --> 00:39:24.190
is preferentially coming
from the left hemisphere,

00:39:24.190 --> 00:39:26.710
and pulling in
more motoric stuff

00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:30.580
on the side of the brain that
operates this part of the body.

00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:33.540
It is lateralized communication.

00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:37.710
The same has now been seen
when you do imaging on monkeys.

00:39:37.710 --> 00:39:39.250
When they're
communicating, there

00:39:39.250 --> 00:39:42.840
is a bias towards the left
hemisphere, the thickened area.

00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:46.550
It's the start of
the specialization.

00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:51.460
Moreover, in both humans and
in other apes and monkeys,

00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:56.320
there is very, very close
connections between the Broca's

00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:59.770
area, or the pre-proto
Broca's area in a monkey,

00:39:59.770 --> 00:40:02.260
and all sorts of
muscle groups having

00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:06.010
to do with facial
expressions-- intensely

00:40:06.010 --> 00:40:08.250
intertwined connectivity there.

00:40:08.250 --> 00:40:10.430
And that's that prosody stuff.

00:40:10.430 --> 00:40:14.270
Seemingly, a monkey making
some of it's emotionally loaded

00:40:14.270 --> 00:40:17.010
vocalizations, there's
some facial prosody

00:40:17.010 --> 00:40:20.690
that goes along with it because
the wiring is very, very

00:40:20.690 --> 00:40:21.980
intertwined there.

00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:25.270
And it's facial stuff that
tends to be lateralized

00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:27.810
to the right side of the face.

00:40:27.810 --> 00:40:32.110
Finally, when a monkey in
a brain imaging machine

00:40:32.110 --> 00:40:35.060
is hearing vocalization
of its own species,

00:40:35.060 --> 00:40:36.700
the left hemisphere
preferentially

00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:42.090
activates in the proto
equivalents of these areas.

00:40:42.090 --> 00:40:44.840
And then, finally
finally, what people

00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:48.980
are beginning to see in
skulls from ancient ancestors

00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:52.940
like australopithecus is
these really tough things

00:40:52.940 --> 00:40:56.920
to infer very indirectly
from endocasts of what would

00:40:56.920 --> 00:40:58.480
be the brain inside the skull.

00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:01.670
But australopithecus a
million years ago or so,

00:41:01.670 --> 00:41:04.120
already a little
bit of an asymmetry

00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:05.626
in the left hemisphere.

00:41:05.626 --> 00:41:07.000
So this has been
something that's

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:12.060
been developing in monkeys and
apes for a long, long time.

00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:15.120
Switching now from
neurobiology, moving back--

00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:17.545
there is hormones
that are relevant,

00:41:17.545 --> 00:41:19.620
and acute environmental
whatevers.

00:41:19.620 --> 00:41:21.420
But we're going to
skip over those just

00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:23.430
because a huge
feature of the field

00:41:23.430 --> 00:41:27.050
is language acquisition,
language development

00:41:27.050 --> 00:41:29.010
early in life.

00:41:29.010 --> 00:41:32.110
And there, you have one
of the great debates

00:41:32.110 --> 00:41:35.720
in the field coming in
around the 1960s or so, which

00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:38.200
was between these
two silverbacks

00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:41.010
in this whole field, both of
whom you've heard of before.

00:41:41.010 --> 00:41:44.780
One, B.F. Skinner, the
king of behaviorism

00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:49.280
who probably was as most
influential by the 1960s 1970s

00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:53.540
or so, and Noam Chomsky,
a champion of a very

00:41:53.540 --> 00:41:54.730
different view of language.

00:41:54.730 --> 00:41:57.650
Chomsky, who is
still around, and who

00:41:57.650 --> 00:41:59.500
to the extent that
I can understand it,

00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:02.230
revolutionized linguistics
when he was about

00:42:02.230 --> 00:42:03.860
four and a half years old.

00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:05.760
And has been the dominant
figure in the field

00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:08.820
for 2/3 of a century since.

00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:11.150
OK, so here was
the basic matchup

00:42:11.150 --> 00:42:12.680
in their wrestling match.

00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:15.070
Behaviorist view--
you can already

00:42:15.070 --> 00:42:18.450
construct what the behaviorist
view of language acquisition

00:42:18.450 --> 00:42:22.110
is going to be, which is
you begin to make a sound,

00:42:22.110 --> 00:42:23.550
attempting to learn a word.

00:42:23.550 --> 00:42:26.340
And if you say it
right, you get rewarded.

00:42:26.340 --> 00:42:27.910
Oh, please feed me.

00:42:27.910 --> 00:42:30.200
Very well said, I'm
going to feed you now.

00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:32.550
And now you've
learned to say that.

00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:34.230
[MUMBLING], you don't get fed.

00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:36.180
And you get severely
hypoglycemic.

00:42:36.180 --> 00:42:39.190
And you try to find other,
until you happen to stumble

00:42:39.190 --> 00:42:40.515
on the right way to say it.

00:42:40.515 --> 00:42:42.760
And, oh, I've been
negatively enforced

00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:44.590
when saying [MUMBLING].

00:42:44.590 --> 00:42:47.230
And I've been positively--
and just do that all the time.

00:42:47.230 --> 00:42:51.300
And that's how I learn language
in a classic behaviorist

00:42:51.300 --> 00:42:52.280
framework.

00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:54.460
Chomsky, meanwhile,
was taking a stance

00:42:54.460 --> 00:42:58.840
that this bears no resemblance
at all to what is going on.

00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:02.250
And what we'll see is
more versions of his view

00:43:02.250 --> 00:43:03.770
have prevailed.

00:43:03.770 --> 00:43:06.980
Basically, the behaviorist
view was just sheer,

00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:07.900
raving gibberish.

00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:10.410
But this produced
these fireworks

00:43:10.410 --> 00:43:14.200
of debates between Skinner and
Chomsky in the '60s and '70s.

00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:15.210
Skinner was at Harvard.

00:43:15.210 --> 00:43:16.750
Chomsky was at MIT.

00:43:16.750 --> 00:43:20.230
And they were regularly lobbing
missiles across at each other,

00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:22.430
and shooting across
their bows and stuff.

00:43:22.430 --> 00:43:25.110
And this was this
huge debate, simply

00:43:25.110 --> 00:43:29.960
because behaviorism was
so totally dominating

00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:33.150
American psychology at the time
with a complete stranglehold

00:43:33.150 --> 00:43:36.270
that there was Skinner, and like
three and a half other people

00:43:36.270 --> 00:43:38.890
out there who had any
sort of academic training

00:43:38.890 --> 00:43:42.380
who would seriously argue
that you acquire language

00:43:42.380 --> 00:43:44.560
through standard
behaviorist rules.

00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:47.950
That was their extreme
view, and a behaviorist sort

00:43:47.950 --> 00:43:51.920
of standing in the sand on that
one, and virtually no evidence

00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:53.180
for it at all.

00:43:53.180 --> 00:43:56.050
So what's the Chomskian
view about, instead?

00:43:56.050 --> 00:43:59.360
The very nature of
language acquisition

00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:01.820
shows that it is
not behaviorist,

00:44:01.820 --> 00:44:05.940
because of a very significant,
critical thing that kids

00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:07.810
do as they learn language.

00:44:07.810 --> 00:44:13.350
A landmark somewhere along the
way, 15 to 20 months of age,

00:44:13.350 --> 00:44:18.030
this major, major event,
the first time a child

00:44:18.030 --> 00:44:23.800
says a combination of words
that it's never heard before.

00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:26.750
I like chocolate ice
cream, says the child.

00:44:26.750 --> 00:44:30.930
Now you say, oh, here, there's
such a thing as Velcro ice

00:44:30.930 --> 00:44:31.450
cream.

00:44:31.450 --> 00:44:33.540
And the child after
tasting it, never

00:44:33.540 --> 00:44:36.212
before having heard the
sentence, I like Velcro ice

00:44:36.212 --> 00:44:38.780
cream, now says, I
like Velcro ice cream.

00:44:38.780 --> 00:44:42.390
It has just generated
a language construction

00:44:42.390 --> 00:44:44.560
that it has never heard.

00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:48.610
The generativity of
language, the possibility

00:44:48.610 --> 00:44:52.390
that kids not only that business
of a finite number of words,

00:44:52.390 --> 00:44:55.390
but an infinite number of
messages, but at some point

00:44:55.390 --> 00:44:57.650
kids do something
which is impossible

00:44:57.650 --> 00:44:59.330
by strict behaviorism.

00:44:59.330 --> 00:45:04.170
They generate examples of things
they have never heard before.

00:45:04.170 --> 00:45:06.640
And this is, in
the Chomskian view,

00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:10.520
this inflection point where
something explosive exponential

00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:11.340
occurs.

00:45:11.340 --> 00:45:12.900
That's where it goes off.

00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:14.840
And there was a
Chomskyte disciple,

00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:17.850
a guy named Roger Brown, who
was a professor for many years

00:45:17.850 --> 00:45:22.350
at Harvard, who did this insane,
obsessive study to actually

00:45:22.350 --> 00:45:25.370
demonstrate what everybody
can infer, like, if they ever

00:45:25.370 --> 00:45:27.770
had kids, which was
having kids where

00:45:27.770 --> 00:45:30.680
he and his band of
researchers would keep track

00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:32.740
of every single
word kids would say

00:45:32.740 --> 00:45:34.100
during their first year of life.

00:45:34.100 --> 00:45:37.090
God knows how the parents
put up with these people

00:45:37.090 --> 00:45:39.180
hanging around in the
nursery and stuff.

00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:42.220
But what they showed
was, yes, suddenly

00:45:42.220 --> 00:45:45.610
you have kids generating
language constructions

00:45:45.610 --> 00:45:48.620
that they have
never heard before.

00:45:48.620 --> 00:45:50.800
And Chomsky has
advanced a whole view

00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:53.630
that there is an innate
structure to language.

00:45:53.630 --> 00:45:56.860
And this is one of the key
bits of his argument, that

00:45:56.860 --> 00:45:59.960
right around a certain
point of development kids

00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:04.270
are able to generalize
the rules of language

00:46:04.270 --> 00:46:08.280
into constructions
they have never heard.

00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:11.410
Moreover, kids are
able to generalize

00:46:11.410 --> 00:46:15.310
the rules of language when
they have only got an imperfect

00:46:15.310 --> 00:46:19.170
instruction by adults speaking
around them who may not

00:46:19.170 --> 00:46:20.450
be grammatically perfect.

00:46:20.450 --> 00:46:22.220
And one individual
may be off here

00:46:22.220 --> 00:46:25.040
or there in one word,
somebody off in another one--

00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:28.270
if nothing else, not producing
every possible combination.

00:46:28.270 --> 00:46:31.900
And out comes a sense
of the grammar from kids

00:46:31.900 --> 00:46:35.990
when constructing rules
out of imperfect examples,

00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:39.750
and constructing completely
novel combinations of words

00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:42.690
that they've never heard before.

00:46:42.690 --> 00:46:44.922
So the argument that
has always been sort of

00:46:44.922 --> 00:46:46.670
at the core of
the Chomskian view

00:46:46.670 --> 00:46:49.950
is when kids suddenly
explode into this language

00:46:49.950 --> 00:46:52.960
acquisition-- to give you a
sense of this, there are long,

00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:56.240
long stretches where you are
learning about 10 words a day

00:46:56.240 --> 00:46:57.310
during development.

00:46:57.310 --> 00:47:01.480
By college, typical person has
a vocabulary of 60,000 words.

00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:03.870
You are not going to
have gotten those 60,000

00:47:03.870 --> 00:47:06.580
from behaviorist reward
and punishment stuff.

00:47:06.580 --> 00:47:08.460
What is this explosion about?

00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:10.720
And what's always been
an argument in favor

00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:13.740
of the Chomskian notion that
there is something innate,

00:47:13.740 --> 00:47:16.770
there is innate drive
towards language acquisition,

00:47:16.770 --> 00:47:20.650
is what's called the poverty
of stimulus argument, which

00:47:20.650 --> 00:47:24.260
is stated quite simply,
kids are generating

00:47:24.260 --> 00:47:27.990
a lot more examples of
language then they're hearing.

00:47:27.990 --> 00:47:30.186
They're generating
all sorts of things

00:47:30.186 --> 00:47:31.310
that they have never heard.

00:47:31.310 --> 00:47:33.980
This whole example
here, kids have

00:47:33.980 --> 00:47:38.481
to be learning in some prepared
learning, ethological way.

00:47:38.481 --> 00:47:40.730
And that's a term that
definitely comes into the field

00:47:40.730 --> 00:47:42.950
because they are
generating constructions

00:47:42.950 --> 00:47:44.710
they have never heard before.

00:47:44.710 --> 00:47:48.080
They cannot possibly
be taught to do that.

00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:51.580
And they are not being sat down
and being explicitly taught

00:47:51.580 --> 00:47:53.360
the structure of grammar.

00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:58.190
They are constructing rules out
of imperfect, partial examples.

00:47:58.190 --> 00:48:00.200
So that's always been
a very strong argument.

00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:02.100
And there's always
been a counter argument

00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:04.530
saying that you
don't have to have

00:48:04.530 --> 00:48:07.750
strict instruction of every
single type of construction

00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:09.660
of words that you generate.

00:48:09.660 --> 00:48:11.830
You can have
statistical learning.

00:48:11.830 --> 00:48:15.450
You can pick up the rules
from statistical patterns.

00:48:15.450 --> 00:48:18.230
And you can do that with
artificial intelligence

00:48:18.230 --> 00:48:18.920
programs.

00:48:18.920 --> 00:48:21.380
And you can do that with adults
who could pick up patterns.

00:48:21.380 --> 00:48:24.910
And a number of years
ago, extremely cool study

00:48:24.910 --> 00:48:27.750
showing that kids
way before they

00:48:27.750 --> 00:48:30.460
start using language--
six months of age or so--

00:48:30.460 --> 00:48:33.980
can actually pick up statistical
patterns in language.

00:48:33.980 --> 00:48:35.970
How would they show this?

00:48:35.970 --> 00:48:39.250
They would have a whole bunch
of nonsense syllables, which

00:48:39.250 --> 00:48:41.220
they would play
long strings of them

00:48:41.220 --> 00:48:44.390
at these kids where there
would be combinations.

00:48:44.390 --> 00:48:46.980
These two nonsense
syllables, the first one

00:48:46.980 --> 00:48:50.470
would be followed by the
second one 100% of the time.

00:48:50.470 --> 00:48:53.460
This combination would be
followed 90% of the time.

00:48:53.460 --> 00:48:56.230
This one 75, this one
10%, this one never,

00:48:56.230 --> 00:48:58.940
and long strings of
these, and showing

00:48:58.940 --> 00:49:03.490
that kids would begin to learn
the statistical associations.

00:49:03.490 --> 00:49:04.850
How do you know?

00:49:04.850 --> 00:49:06.760
Because you play
a novel pairing.

00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:10.167
You get one of these pairings
where 90% of the time

00:49:10.167 --> 00:49:11.000
you make this sound.

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:12.750
And it's followed
by this on the tape.

00:49:12.750 --> 00:49:14.480
Now, instead, you
make this sound.

00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:17.860
And it's followed by something
it's never associated with.

00:49:17.860 --> 00:49:20.990
And the kid's heart rate
increases, because this

00:49:20.990 --> 00:49:22.810
is a novel combination.

00:49:22.810 --> 00:49:24.400
And it is not an all or none.

00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:27.260
It is merely a statistical
linking of the two.

00:49:27.260 --> 00:49:30.600
So really young kids can
do statistical learning,

00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:34.080
picking up statistical patterns
in language very different

00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:36.340
than people would have guessed.

00:49:36.340 --> 00:49:39.096
OK, so now let us take
a five minute break.

00:49:39.096 --> 00:49:40.720
And we will start
marching through some

00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:45.220
of the developmental landmarks
and what the biology is of it.

00:49:45.220 --> 00:49:47.760
What you see in terms of
child development language

00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:50.850
acquisition is one very
clear phenomenon, which

00:49:50.850 --> 00:49:53.280
is right at the
beginning of life,

00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:56.550
a kid could learn any
single language out there.

00:49:56.550 --> 00:49:59.460
There are hundreds and
hundreds of different vowel

00:49:59.460 --> 00:50:02.940
sounds in different languages,
even more consonant sounds.

00:50:02.940 --> 00:50:05.980
And any kid and can
learn any language.

00:50:05.980 --> 00:50:09.310
And what you see in a child
in one to three months of age

00:50:09.310 --> 00:50:13.060
is roughly equal
response to any phonemes,

00:50:13.060 --> 00:50:15.750
any sounds that are
building blocks of language.

00:50:15.750 --> 00:50:19.850
And what development is from
there is you lose that ability.

00:50:19.850 --> 00:50:22.420
As you begin to
acquire your own,

00:50:22.420 --> 00:50:25.020
you start being unable
to hear the difference

00:50:25.020 --> 00:50:26.420
between other sounds.

00:50:26.420 --> 00:50:29.180
And, suddenly, you're back
to taking biopsies out

00:50:29.180 --> 00:50:31.510
of bears instead
of pairs, depending

00:50:31.510 --> 00:50:33.050
on what language you're in.

00:50:33.050 --> 00:50:35.650
As you acquire your
own language, virtually

00:50:35.650 --> 00:50:38.520
by definition in
acquiring it, you

00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:41.310
are losing the capacity
to hear vast amounts

00:50:41.310 --> 00:50:45.190
of phonemic subtlety from
all the other languages.

00:50:45.190 --> 00:50:47.470
By three months of
age, kids are already

00:50:47.470 --> 00:50:49.530
beginning to preferentially
pay attention

00:50:49.530 --> 00:50:54.140
to a spoken language, rather
than nonsense syllables.

00:50:54.140 --> 00:50:57.020
They are already beginning
to note structure of language

00:50:57.020 --> 00:50:59.140
in terms of what
they pay attention.

00:50:59.140 --> 00:51:01.470
By three to six
months of age, they're

00:51:01.470 --> 00:51:04.900
already preferentially paying
attention to vowel sounds.

00:51:04.900 --> 00:51:08.730
They're beginning to learn
that sounds are broken up.

00:51:08.730 --> 00:51:11.930
They're beginning to do that
statistical relationship stuff

00:51:11.930 --> 00:51:13.760
of combinations of sounds.

00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:16.750
Somewhere by about eight,
nine months of age, babbling

00:51:16.750 --> 00:51:20.100
starts, and, again, the business
about babbling during sign

00:51:20.100 --> 00:51:21.810
language showing that.

00:51:21.810 --> 00:51:24.810
What you also see is
when kids start babbling,

00:51:24.810 --> 00:51:27.440
they tend to have stronger
facial expressions

00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:29.670
on the right side
of their face--

00:51:29.670 --> 00:51:33.180
that same argument about the
left hemisphere beginning

00:51:33.180 --> 00:51:35.840
to take some control over stuff.

00:51:35.840 --> 00:51:37.460
What else?

00:51:37.460 --> 00:51:39.260
By nine months of age,
kids are beginning

00:51:39.260 --> 00:51:42.260
to recognize structures,
word combinations.

00:51:42.260 --> 00:51:43.870
In terms of responding
to them, they

00:51:43.870 --> 00:51:48.110
are beginning to have lost
an awful lot of their ability

00:51:48.110 --> 00:51:50.540
to pick up phonemes
from other languages.

00:51:50.540 --> 00:51:52.580
By about 11 months
of age, they are

00:51:52.580 --> 00:51:54.971
beginning to generate the
typical vowels, consonants

00:51:54.971 --> 00:51:55.720
of their language.

00:51:55.720 --> 00:51:58.320
And out of that pops
language soon afterward.

00:51:58.320 --> 00:52:01.530
OK, so a feature of
language acquisition

00:52:01.530 --> 00:52:04.480
in humans which
is pretty bizarre

00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:06.860
is that adult members
of our species

00:52:06.860 --> 00:52:10.210
sit around and invest
huge amounts of energy

00:52:10.210 --> 00:52:14.570
in a one on one level to in an
intentional premeditated matter

00:52:14.570 --> 00:52:18.260
help young ones acquire the
communication of the species.

00:52:18.260 --> 00:52:21.740
We do directed
teaching of language.

00:52:21.740 --> 00:52:23.720
And this is unique.

00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:27.230
And it turns out, this is not
what is found in most cultures

00:52:27.230 --> 00:52:28.490
on this planet.

00:52:28.490 --> 00:52:31.730
In most of them, kids
pick up language purely

00:52:31.730 --> 00:52:35.690
by observation, by hearing,
by being witness to.

00:52:35.690 --> 00:52:39.510
It is a relatively recent,
Westernized invention--

00:52:39.510 --> 00:52:41.390
I don't know maybe in
the last 1,000 years

00:52:41.390 --> 00:52:43.800
or so-- where you
sit down children.

00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:48.200
And you generate simple
examples of the language, which

00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:52.370
you present in a repetitive
way, simple versions of words,

00:52:52.370 --> 00:52:55.570
of grammar, were you
direct it towards them,

00:52:55.570 --> 00:52:59.120
and were you then correct
their attempts at repeating it.

00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:01.250
That's a relatively
new invention.

00:53:01.250 --> 00:53:05.250
And bizarrely enough,
it's not entirely clear

00:53:05.250 --> 00:53:08.190
if that accelerates
language acquisition, which

00:53:08.190 --> 00:53:10.360
would be a real
drag after everyone

00:53:10.360 --> 00:53:13.490
being tortured with phonics
back when or some such thing.

00:53:13.490 --> 00:53:16.510
This is a relatively
new hominid invention.

00:53:16.510 --> 00:53:18.380
It is relatively
rare culturally.

00:53:18.380 --> 00:53:20.650
And it's not so
clear if it actually

00:53:20.650 --> 00:53:23.670
accomplishes a whole lot.

00:53:23.670 --> 00:53:27.960
Now, part of what you also
find with kids beginning to not

00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:31.580
be able to discriminate between
two different sounds in what

00:53:31.580 --> 00:53:34.090
will prove to be another
language other than the one

00:53:34.090 --> 00:53:37.246
they're learning, that begins
to be when you're doing imaging

00:53:37.246 --> 00:53:41.020
there, that Wernicke's is not
distinguishing between the two

00:53:41.020 --> 00:53:43.810
sounds in terms of its
activation pattern.

00:53:43.810 --> 00:53:46.650
That's where you're
beginning to lose the ability

00:53:46.650 --> 00:53:50.640
to hear universality
of language sounds,

00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:54.030
and instead begin to
focus in on your own.

00:53:54.030 --> 00:53:55.530
What else do you see?

00:53:55.530 --> 00:53:57.910
Second languages-- where
do second languages

00:53:57.910 --> 00:53:59.080
fit in with this?

00:53:59.080 --> 00:54:01.660
And there are all sorts
of critical periods

00:54:01.660 --> 00:54:05.200
of development with it,
as to when it comes in.

00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:06.820
One of the ones
that everybody knows

00:54:06.820 --> 00:54:11.020
is if you learn a language
any time after roughly age 12

00:54:11.020 --> 00:54:13.600
or so, most typically
you will never

00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:15.610
be able to speak it
without an accent

00:54:15.610 --> 00:54:16.980
for the rest of your life.

00:54:16.980 --> 00:54:19.920
That seems to be one of the
landmarks, exceptions, blah,

00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:21.100
blah, the usual.

00:54:21.100 --> 00:54:24.830
Nonetheless, that seems to
be, generally, the pattern.

00:54:24.830 --> 00:54:27.690
What about brain coding
for a second language?

00:54:27.690 --> 00:54:31.860
What is found is if you get a
second language before roughly

00:54:31.860 --> 00:54:36.390
six years of age, essentially if
you were growing up bilingual,

00:54:36.390 --> 00:54:41.160
both languages are coded
in very overlapping regions

00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:43.710
of Wernicke's and Broca's.

00:54:43.710 --> 00:54:45.310
How can you see that?

00:54:45.310 --> 00:54:47.935
Because you get individuals
when they have a stroke

00:54:47.935 --> 00:54:51.720
will get, for example, a
comprehension aphasia in both

00:54:51.720 --> 00:54:54.930
of the languages that they
are native speakers of,

00:54:54.930 --> 00:54:56.400
that they grew up with.

00:54:56.400 --> 00:55:00.420
Learn a language after six,
and what you typically see

00:55:00.420 --> 00:55:04.460
is the Wernicke's area that
does the second language tends

00:55:04.460 --> 00:55:06.840
to be a more peripheral area.

00:55:06.840 --> 00:55:09.910
And likewise, what's
activating a Broca's, you're

00:55:09.910 --> 00:55:12.080
not getting the center seats.

00:55:12.080 --> 00:55:14.080
You're not getting
the orchestra seats

00:55:14.080 --> 00:55:16.570
for where you're doing a second
language if it's coming in

00:55:16.570 --> 00:55:17.290
later.

00:55:17.290 --> 00:55:21.200
And, thus, you can get
the truly bizarre cases

00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:23.410
of people who get a
very selective stroke

00:55:23.410 --> 00:55:26.980
and will lose language
and not the other.

00:55:26.980 --> 00:55:28.720
So you begin to get that there.

00:55:28.720 --> 00:55:32.130
What accents are about, what the
critical period is on accents,

00:55:32.130 --> 00:55:33.040
God knows.

00:55:33.040 --> 00:55:37.280
But you have that coming in
there by around age 12 or so.

00:55:37.280 --> 00:55:42.250
Next, acquisition invention
of new languages-- and this

00:55:42.250 --> 00:55:44.770
is relevant in terms of
child acquisition of language

00:55:44.770 --> 00:55:47.020
because of what's a
truism in the field, which

00:55:47.020 --> 00:55:50.300
is new languages are
invented by kids.

00:55:50.300 --> 00:55:52.720
Adults do not invent
new languages.

00:55:52.720 --> 00:55:55.160
Adults may be able to go
to the office each day

00:55:55.160 --> 00:55:56.870
and decide whether
this or that word

00:55:56.870 --> 00:55:58.980
should be protected from
the French language.

00:55:58.980 --> 00:56:02.330
But languages are
invented by kids.

00:56:02.330 --> 00:56:06.470
And what you see with that
is a standard pattern of age

00:56:06.470 --> 00:56:09.680
distribution, of novelty,
which is not only

00:56:09.680 --> 00:56:12.450
do languages tend to
be invented by kids.

00:56:12.450 --> 00:56:15.490
But nobody a whole lot
older than them ever

00:56:15.490 --> 00:56:17.400
learns the new language.

00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:20.240
New languages are
invented by the young

00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:23.220
and have lateral and
downward transfer.

00:56:23.220 --> 00:56:25.140
This is what you see.

00:56:25.140 --> 00:56:29.390
Great example of this-- about
20 years ago in Nicaragua,

00:56:29.390 --> 00:56:32.660
where for the first time
after the revolution

00:56:32.660 --> 00:56:34.610
there, for the first
time there was anything

00:56:34.610 --> 00:56:36.950
done in the country in
the way of education

00:56:36.950 --> 00:56:39.100
for deaf children, who
otherwise were just

00:56:39.100 --> 00:56:42.140
left to sort of languish
in villages, and ignored,

00:56:42.140 --> 00:56:43.710
and not educated,
and all of that--

00:56:43.710 --> 00:56:45.500
the first attempts
to have schools

00:56:45.500 --> 00:56:47.690
explicitly for deaf children.

00:56:47.690 --> 00:56:49.570
And people there
teaching them were

00:56:49.570 --> 00:56:52.719
beginning to grow for
OK, how are we going

00:56:52.719 --> 00:56:54.010
to communicate with these kids?

00:56:54.010 --> 00:56:56.220
What's going to be
an efficient way?

00:56:56.220 --> 00:56:59.170
And worth noting, in addition
to American Sign Language,

00:56:59.170 --> 00:57:00.580
there's British Sign Language.

00:57:00.580 --> 00:57:02.240
And there's French
Sign Language.

00:57:02.240 --> 00:57:03.700
There's all different ones.

00:57:03.700 --> 00:57:06.580
And what began to emerge
after the first year

00:57:06.580 --> 00:57:09.670
or so in the school
was the kids came up

00:57:09.670 --> 00:57:11.220
with their own language.

00:57:11.220 --> 00:57:15.350
They began to generate their
own sign language, which

00:57:15.350 --> 00:57:18.360
over the subsequent generations
became more and more

00:57:18.360 --> 00:57:20.180
mature and sophisticated.

00:57:20.180 --> 00:57:22.260
And we'll see ways in
which that occurred.

00:57:22.260 --> 00:57:25.090
And this is now
Nicaraguan Sign Language.

00:57:25.090 --> 00:57:29.160
This is the sign language that
is taught to deaf individuals

00:57:29.160 --> 00:57:29.750
there.

00:57:29.750 --> 00:57:31.860
And this was invented by kids.

00:57:31.860 --> 00:57:34.149
This emerged from
the students there

00:57:34.149 --> 00:57:35.940
while the adults were
trying to figure out,

00:57:35.940 --> 00:57:39.360
and having conferences,
and meetings, about what

00:57:39.360 --> 00:57:40.780
sort of sign to use for this.

00:57:40.780 --> 00:57:43.470
And there are the kids
in the dorms generating

00:57:43.470 --> 00:57:44.670
their own language.

00:57:44.670 --> 00:57:47.070
10-year-old kids was
the average age there

00:57:47.070 --> 00:57:48.360
where this was happening.

00:57:48.360 --> 00:57:51.400
Language was
invented by new kids.

00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:55.520
And what you saw with the
Nicaraguan Sign Language was it

00:57:55.520 --> 00:57:58.770
took about three generations
worth of school kids

00:57:58.770 --> 00:58:02.440
to have a fully-formed
grammar in the language

00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:06.870
as complex of a grammar capacity
for embedded clauses, all

00:58:06.870 --> 00:58:09.630
that sort of thing, as you
would find in any other sign

00:58:09.630 --> 00:58:10.130
language.

00:58:10.130 --> 00:58:12.110
It took about three generations.

00:58:12.110 --> 00:58:14.470
And with each new
elaboration, it

00:58:14.470 --> 00:58:18.160
was whichever kids had come up
with it, and everybody younger.

00:58:18.160 --> 00:58:20.740
Even after a while,
the original generation

00:58:20.740 --> 00:58:23.340
who had invented
Nicaraguan Sign Language,

00:58:23.340 --> 00:58:25.380
that first generation,
they weren't

00:58:25.380 --> 00:58:28.330
very good at the later,
fancier versions.

00:58:28.330 --> 00:58:32.250
That same deal-- languages
are invented by the young.

00:58:32.250 --> 00:58:35.180
And languages are greatly
shaped, and changed,

00:58:35.180 --> 00:58:37.860
and modified by
the young as well.

00:58:37.860 --> 00:58:39.560
And there's not a
whole lot of people

00:58:39.560 --> 00:58:42.240
older than them who
ever pick up on it.

00:58:42.240 --> 00:58:44.880
So that's a pattern
again and again.

00:58:44.880 --> 00:58:48.570
So acquisition of language,
what's going on in the brain

00:58:48.570 --> 00:58:49.520
there?

00:58:49.520 --> 00:58:54.680
Prenatally, you already begin to
get-- OK, let's cut the brain.

00:58:58.890 --> 00:58:59.732
There you have it.

00:58:59.732 --> 00:59:01.190
There's the brain
in cross-section,

00:59:01.190 --> 00:59:02.450
cutting right through there.

00:59:02.450 --> 00:59:04.610
And what we have,
this is the left side,

00:59:04.610 --> 00:59:08.660
is thickening of what would
be Broca's, thickening

00:59:08.660 --> 00:59:10.600
of Wernicke's.

00:59:10.600 --> 00:59:14.350
It's around 12 to 16
weeks of age in a fetus

00:59:14.350 --> 00:59:18.610
that you begin to see different
patterns of gene expression

00:59:18.610 --> 00:59:22.480
around here versus there.

00:59:22.480 --> 00:59:25.100
And a couple of these are
genes that have already

00:59:25.100 --> 00:59:27.950
been identified
to have mutations

00:59:27.950 --> 00:59:31.310
in families with language
production disorders.

00:59:31.310 --> 00:59:35.950
So around then, begin to have
differential gene expression.

00:59:35.950 --> 00:59:41.700
By around 30 weeks, this part is
now thicker than on this side.

00:59:41.700 --> 00:59:44.950
You're beginning to get
the structural asymmetry.

00:59:44.950 --> 00:59:48.600
Interestingly, during the
first few years of language,

00:59:48.600 --> 00:59:51.440
you don't see
enhanced metabolism

00:59:51.440 --> 00:59:55.220
on this side relevant to that
side when kids are talking.

00:59:55.220 --> 00:59:57.120
Even amid the right
side of their face

00:59:57.120 --> 00:59:59.940
being more expressive,
it's not until a few years

00:59:59.940 --> 01:00:04.870
that you lateralize all the
metabolic activation there.

01:00:04.870 --> 01:00:06.750
Next bit of development
that's pertinent

01:00:06.750 --> 01:00:09.320
is that stuff about myelin.

01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:10.900
Myelin, you remember the axons.

01:00:10.900 --> 01:00:12.440
And you wrap them
up with myelin.

01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:15.655
And your frontal cortexes,
which are not myelinated fully

01:00:15.655 --> 01:00:17.160
yet in most of you guys.

01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:19.220
What you see developmentally
with language

01:00:19.220 --> 01:00:21.830
is something not terribly
Earth shattering,

01:00:21.830 --> 01:00:25.340
which is kids tend to
myelinate their Wernicke's

01:00:25.340 --> 01:00:28.690
area about three months before
they myelinate their Broca's

01:00:28.690 --> 01:00:29.360
area.

01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:31.970
Kids are starting to
comprehend language

01:00:31.970 --> 01:00:33.720
before they are producing it.

01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:35.880
So Wernicke's is
beginning to wire up

01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:37.530
around nine months of age.

01:00:37.530 --> 01:00:40.570
Typically, Broca's takes
a few months past that.

01:00:40.570 --> 01:00:42.940
That's the time course.

01:00:42.940 --> 01:00:47.870
OK, so intrinsic neurobiology
of language acquisition-- how

01:00:47.870 --> 01:00:51.400
about social aspects,
environmental aspects?

01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:53.250
And right off the
bat, we pick up

01:00:53.250 --> 01:00:57.180
on something we heard,
a couple of weeks

01:00:57.180 --> 01:01:00.800
ago, that whole business
about the importance of peer

01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:04.440
socialization rather
than parental influences.

01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:07.530
And that's the work of that
psychologist Judith Rich Harris

01:01:07.530 --> 01:01:10.860
arguing that peer
influences are far more

01:01:10.860 --> 01:01:13.760
important than the literature
has usually given credence to.

01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:16.470
And the area where it
is most clearly the case

01:01:16.470 --> 01:01:18.600
is language acquisition.

01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:21.890
And that was her whole
point as to why kids grow up

01:01:21.890 --> 01:01:25.050
with accents of the
community around them,

01:01:25.050 --> 01:01:27.250
rather than the absence
of their parents

01:01:27.250 --> 01:01:30.560
if the parents were not native
speakers of that language.

01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:34.230
Why do you pick up the accents
of your peers around you

01:01:34.230 --> 01:01:35.980
and those a little bit older?

01:01:35.980 --> 01:01:39.010
Because peers are
pretty important.

01:01:39.010 --> 01:01:41.190
And back to that
issue of it being

01:01:41.190 --> 01:01:43.830
a relatively new
invention for humans

01:01:43.830 --> 01:01:46.420
to try to have somebody
acquire language

01:01:46.420 --> 01:01:48.660
by sitting them
down, and instructing

01:01:48.660 --> 01:01:50.230
them, and correcting
their errors,

01:01:50.230 --> 01:01:51.940
what most of
language acquisition

01:01:51.940 --> 01:01:54.380
has been about for a
gazillion years in humans

01:01:54.380 --> 01:01:58.157
is you learn from your older
sibling, and your cousins who

01:01:58.157 --> 01:01:59.490
are a little bit older than you.

01:01:59.490 --> 01:02:00.770
And they learn
from their cousins

01:02:00.770 --> 01:02:01.920
who are a little bit older.

01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:03.850
And that's where
language is attained.

01:02:03.850 --> 01:02:06.600
And you watch the adults,
and listen to them.

01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:10.170
We're very wired to pick
up our language influences

01:02:10.170 --> 01:02:12.710
from peer groups, and
slightly older ones.

01:02:12.710 --> 01:02:16.410
So her emphasizing right off
the bat that remarkable deal.

01:02:16.410 --> 01:02:18.980
When you think about it,
it's totally amazing.

01:02:18.980 --> 01:02:22.590
Nobody winds up with the
accent of their home language.

01:02:22.590 --> 01:02:25.800
They wind up with the accent
of the community around them.

01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:27.350
For the rest of
their life, they may

01:02:27.350 --> 01:02:31.090
be incredibly good at imitating
their parents in the home

01:02:31.090 --> 01:02:31.900
accent.

01:02:31.900 --> 01:02:34.980
And, surprisingly
early, as I mentioned,

01:02:34.980 --> 01:02:38.090
they do not want to answer their
parents in the home language.

01:02:38.090 --> 01:02:40.240
They start preferring
the outside language--

01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:44.250
all this evidence of the
strong peer socialization.

01:02:44.250 --> 01:02:48.080
What's intrinsic in that
is language acquisition

01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:50.610
also involves a huge
amount of inculcation

01:02:50.610 --> 01:02:54.540
into the values of the society
that uses that language.

01:02:54.540 --> 01:02:57.920
And intrinsic in that is
kids at very young ages

01:02:57.920 --> 01:03:01.570
already getting embarrassed
about their parents' accent,

01:03:01.570 --> 01:03:04.730
and wanting to answer them
not in the home language,

01:03:04.730 --> 01:03:07.700
values built into that.

01:03:07.700 --> 01:03:10.070
Examples-- one that
we heard already back

01:03:10.070 --> 01:03:13.700
in the aggression lecture, that
whole business of languages

01:03:13.700 --> 01:03:17.780
that have a formal you class,
and an informal to and who

01:03:17.780 --> 01:03:19.300
in French, for example.

01:03:19.300 --> 01:03:21.530
And that business
that after revolutions

01:03:21.530 --> 01:03:25.290
as a value statement in terms
of that pseudo kinship stuff,

01:03:25.290 --> 01:03:28.840
everyone is supposed to use
the informal structures there.

01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:32.080
Everyone is supposed to use
the informal conjugations.

01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:35.150
Great thing in
Tolstoy's autobiography

01:03:35.150 --> 01:03:37.400
back when he was a
kid-- apparently,

01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:41.080
at one point, the family nurse,
who adored him and had raised

01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:44.480
him and all of that, one
day sort of spoke to him

01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:47.730
and used the informal
verb tense in Russian.

01:03:47.730 --> 01:03:52.980
And he threw a fit because she
was not of his social class.

01:03:52.980 --> 01:03:55.680
And how dare she
use the informal.

01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:57.990
She should be addressing
him as the young master,

01:03:57.990 --> 01:03:59.660
or whatever the
Russian conjugation

01:03:59.660 --> 01:04:05.080
equivalent was-- that one
laden, laden with social values.

01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:07.770
More examples of this--
different languages,

01:04:07.770 --> 01:04:10.760
very different notions
about relationships

01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:12.430
expressed between people.

01:04:12.430 --> 01:04:16.070
For example, in English you
can be talking to a relative

01:04:16.070 --> 01:04:19.450
and say something like
my aunt, your mother.

01:04:19.450 --> 01:04:22.564
Or you could be saying,
my aunt, your grandmother.

01:04:22.564 --> 01:04:24.810
And that's how you
communicate it.

01:04:24.810 --> 01:04:28.630
In certain languages-- for
example one in the Malayan

01:04:28.630 --> 01:04:31.660
peninsula-- what you find
is if you were saying

01:04:31.660 --> 01:04:35.430
my aunt, your mother, is a
completely different word then

01:04:35.430 --> 01:04:37.580
my aunt, your grandmother.

01:04:37.580 --> 01:04:40.100
It is not possible
to state a kinship

01:04:40.100 --> 01:04:43.670
word without it reflecting
also the person you're

01:04:43.670 --> 01:04:44.780
speaking with.

01:04:44.780 --> 01:04:48.850
You cannot talk about kinship
terms outside of the context

01:04:48.850 --> 01:04:52.880
of it being a conversation
and interaction much,

01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:57.380
much more indicative of
intertwined relations there.

01:04:57.380 --> 01:04:57.950
How is this?

01:04:57.950 --> 01:04:59.350
Here's another example.

01:04:59.350 --> 01:05:04.500
Here, you have in what would
be termed egocentric languages,

01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:07.630
like English, you refer
to directions with respect

01:05:07.630 --> 01:05:09.090
to your body.

01:05:09.090 --> 01:05:12.170
It's over there, you
say, indicating where it

01:05:12.170 --> 01:05:14.190
is with respect to your body.

01:05:14.190 --> 01:05:15.940
Where is that person standing?

01:05:15.940 --> 01:05:17.360
Just behind him.

01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:19.280
What you see in a lot
of other languages,

01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:22.050
less egocentric
ones, is directions

01:05:22.050 --> 01:05:26.040
are entirely a function
of external landmarks.

01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:28.120
And, thus, in a bunch
of aboriginal languages

01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:30.380
in Australia, you
can't say something

01:05:30.380 --> 01:05:33.190
like, oh, my right
foot is on fire.

01:05:33.190 --> 01:05:35.370
You can only say,
oh, my foot that's

01:05:35.370 --> 01:05:37.990
to the Northwest is on fire.

01:05:37.990 --> 01:05:42.710
The world is based by external
landmarks, rather than

01:05:42.710 --> 01:05:44.500
ones that are internal.

01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:47.630
Great example I heard
of this from [? Leah ?]

01:05:47.630 --> 01:05:50.325
[? Burdinksi-- ?] oh no, I
just mispronounced her name,

01:05:50.325 --> 01:05:50.980
I'm sure.

01:05:50.980 --> 01:05:53.563
And that's shameful, given that
it's a Russian name like mine.

01:05:53.563 --> 01:05:56.325
But in any case, in the
psychology department,

01:05:56.325 --> 01:05:58.380
and telling me this
great example that

01:05:58.380 --> 01:06:02.060
you get in some of these
non-ego language ones.

01:06:02.060 --> 01:06:06.760
OK, we tend to think of stories
going from left to right.

01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:09.390
If you give somebody
a bunch of tiles,

01:06:09.390 --> 01:06:12.140
which is part of frequent
IQ tests for kids,

01:06:12.140 --> 01:06:13.720
and they make a story.

01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:15.380
If you put them in
the right sequence,

01:06:15.380 --> 01:06:18.999
in English, what we do is we
put the first scene on the left.

01:06:18.999 --> 01:06:20.540
And it moves to the
right from there.

01:06:20.540 --> 01:06:23.680
Stories progress
from left to right.

01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:26.090
What you see in
these languages that

01:06:26.090 --> 01:06:31.390
are based by external cues,
is stories begin in the east,

01:06:31.390 --> 01:06:33.290
because that's
where the sun rises.

01:06:33.290 --> 01:06:35.880
So if you were
sitting facing south,

01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:37.530
and you were given
the tiles, you

01:06:37.530 --> 01:06:39.310
would put the story
starting over here,

01:06:39.310 --> 01:06:41.110
because that's where
the sun comes up.

01:06:41.110 --> 01:06:43.640
And if you were sitting,
instead, facing north,

01:06:43.640 --> 01:06:45.490
you would place
the tiles starting

01:06:45.490 --> 01:06:48.940
from the right to left, because
the only pertinent direction

01:06:48.940 --> 01:06:51.780
is nothing with respect
to where your body is,

01:06:51.780 --> 01:06:53.270
where your arms are.

01:06:53.270 --> 01:06:56.160
Directions, things,
start in the east.

01:06:56.160 --> 01:06:58.150
And that determines
things far more

01:06:58.150 --> 01:07:02.850
than your body's orientation--
classic, very non-ego-centered

01:07:02.850 --> 01:07:04.430
directionality in a language.

01:07:04.430 --> 01:07:06.680
So that is very frequent.

01:07:06.680 --> 01:07:09.390
So what begins to be
intrinsic in all of this

01:07:09.390 --> 01:07:13.040
is the notion that language
shapes the way you think.

01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:17.510
And this harks back to a grand
old theory in linguistics

01:07:17.510 --> 01:07:18.950
and language acquisition.

01:07:18.950 --> 01:07:23.450
And two guys, early in the
20th century, Sapir and Whorf.

01:07:23.450 --> 01:07:27.920
And the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis
being that language constrains

01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:30.900
thought, that your
capacity for thinking,

01:07:30.900 --> 01:07:34.310
the way in which you think,
is constrained by the language

01:07:34.310 --> 01:07:36.780
that you have been taught,
the language you speak.

01:07:36.780 --> 01:07:39.300
And that has been
debated endlessly

01:07:39.300 --> 01:07:41.580
in terms of just how
much evidence is there

01:07:41.580 --> 01:07:44.250
for that, versus how
much the style of thought

01:07:44.250 --> 01:07:45.640
shaped what the language is.

01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:47.620
This has endlessly been debated.

01:07:47.620 --> 01:07:51.750
And it's one of the hallmarks
of what linguistics is about.

01:07:51.750 --> 01:07:56.310
In the last decade, two
traditional populations

01:07:56.310 --> 01:07:58.630
in the Amazon that
were studied that

01:07:58.630 --> 01:08:01.600
are viewed as giving
really major support

01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:06.540
for a strict Sapir-Whorf notion
that your capacity for thought,

01:08:06.540 --> 01:08:11.130
the nature of your thought,
is deeply shaped, potentially

01:08:11.130 --> 01:08:13.760
deeply constrained, by language.

01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:16.800
So these two trials-- the
first is called the Paraha.

01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:21.279
And the other is called
the Murdruku, I believe.

01:08:21.279 --> 01:08:22.729
And what you have
in both of them

01:08:22.729 --> 01:08:26.100
is a very different number
system than we have,

01:08:26.100 --> 01:08:28.990
than virtually every
Western society does.

01:08:28.990 --> 01:08:32.350
In the first group, the
Paraha, their number system

01:08:32.350 --> 01:08:36.359
consists of three
numbers-- one, two,

01:08:36.359 --> 01:08:39.640
and something bigger than two.

01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:41.939
In Murdruku, it's
essentially the same thing.

01:08:41.939 --> 01:08:43.300
But it's five terms.

01:08:43.300 --> 01:08:47.840
It goes up to-- six terms, 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, and all other numbers

01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:49.779
that are bigger than five.

01:08:49.779 --> 01:08:51.779
And I don't know
completely what you

01:08:51.779 --> 01:08:54.729
suggests about how often you
have to count stuff down there.

01:08:54.729 --> 01:08:57.029
But what it suggests
is this is going

01:08:57.029 --> 01:08:59.380
to be a very different
relationship with numbers.

01:08:59.380 --> 01:09:02.229
And what they show,
studies with these folks,

01:09:02.229 --> 01:09:06.890
is doing mathematical
computations,

01:09:06.890 --> 01:09:08.450
doing estimates,
doing everything,

01:09:08.450 --> 01:09:11.729
in the second tribe
with numbers up to five,

01:09:11.729 --> 01:09:15.899
the exact same level of
accuracy as would a Westernized

01:09:15.899 --> 01:09:16.950
individual.

01:09:16.950 --> 01:09:20.930
But get above five, and
accuracy goes down the drain.

01:09:20.930 --> 01:09:26.020
Somebody in that society has a
huge amount of trouble telling

01:09:26.020 --> 01:09:27.890
the difference
between six objects

01:09:27.890 --> 01:09:30.724
and eight objects, eight
objects and 10 objects,

01:09:30.724 --> 01:09:34.040
because they all get bucketed
as, how many are there?

01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:36.970
It's the number that
means more than five.

01:09:36.970 --> 01:09:40.040
And in the first group, you
see the same exact thing

01:09:40.040 --> 01:09:42.130
for any number above three.

01:09:42.130 --> 01:09:45.700
There's a lot of trouble being
accurate distinguishing three,

01:09:45.700 --> 01:09:48.390
from four, from five, and
so on, because they all

01:09:48.390 --> 01:09:49.710
have the same term.

01:09:49.710 --> 01:09:52.920
They are that number
that is bigger than two.

01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:56.190
All of that occurring once
you get above those numbers,

01:09:56.190 --> 01:09:59.540
guesses essentially
at the chance level.

01:09:59.540 --> 01:10:02.770
So that's kind of impressive,
and very interesting.

01:10:02.770 --> 01:10:07.230
But maybe there's always
this potential counter

01:10:07.230 --> 01:10:09.160
interpretation as to
what's happening there,

01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:13.010
which is maybe these are not
terribly sharp folks there,

01:10:13.010 --> 01:10:15.070
and maybe have had
all sorts of issues

01:10:15.070 --> 01:10:18.536
with protein malnutrition,
or cerebral malaria,

01:10:18.536 --> 01:10:19.610
or God knows what.

01:10:19.610 --> 01:10:22.680
No, because in each of
these populations, each

01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:25.300
of these cultures,
they know thousands

01:10:25.300 --> 01:10:28.870
of different types of edible
plants and medicinal plants.

01:10:28.870 --> 01:10:31.840
These are enormously
sophisticated people

01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:33.110
in those realms.

01:10:33.110 --> 01:10:35.640
Numbers just aren't a big deal.

01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:39.030
And what you see is somebody
growing up in that society who

01:10:39.030 --> 01:10:42.840
has not invented the language,
but are instead acquiring it,

01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:45.184
it constrains their
ability to tell

01:10:45.184 --> 01:10:46.600
the difference
between the numbers

01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:51.460
three and four-- very
shaping in that regard.

01:10:51.460 --> 01:10:54.250
So all sorts of people
debating endlessly

01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:56.950
how much does language
shape the way you think?

01:10:56.950 --> 01:10:59.220
How much does thinking
shape the sort of language

01:10:59.220 --> 01:11:00.170
you come up with?

01:11:00.170 --> 01:11:01.950
But at the end of
the day, there's

01:11:01.950 --> 01:11:04.690
this whole
philosophical business

01:11:04.690 --> 01:11:07.900
that no matter how similar
the language is that you're

01:11:07.900 --> 01:11:10.800
using with someone else,
it's going to mean something

01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:12.190
slightly different to you.

01:11:12.190 --> 01:11:15.780
And, thus, you have the flipside
to our ethology sound bite.

01:11:15.780 --> 01:11:17.300
Ethology is
interviewing the animal,

01:11:17.300 --> 01:11:18.750
but it's its own language.

01:11:18.750 --> 01:11:20.960
Sort of the flip side, a
quote once to the effect

01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:24.047
of, if you could interview
a lion in its own language,

01:11:24.047 --> 01:11:25.880
you wouldn't have a
clue what it was talking

01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:30.632
about because communication
is so intertwined with mind,

01:11:30.632 --> 01:11:33.940
with values, with meaning,
all of that, that it would

01:11:33.940 --> 01:11:35.770
essentially be inaccessible.

01:11:35.770 --> 01:11:39.160
And you hear about people
who are multilingual.

01:11:39.160 --> 01:11:43.480
How many of you are pretty
adept at a second language?

01:11:43.480 --> 01:11:46.540
Third language?

01:11:46.540 --> 01:11:47.850
Any hands up there?

01:11:47.850 --> 01:11:49.490
Whoa, OK.

01:11:49.490 --> 01:11:51.450
So those of you who
are really comfortable

01:11:51.450 --> 01:11:54.200
in multiple
languages, do you find

01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:56.240
you have different
emotional emotive

01:11:56.240 --> 01:11:59.680
styles of communicating when
you're switching languages?

01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:03.500
Do you tend to have more
expressivity in one of them?

01:12:03.500 --> 01:12:07.180
Do you tend to be more
analytical, whatever?

01:12:07.180 --> 01:12:09.420
OK, I'm going to pretend
that there was just

01:12:09.420 --> 01:12:12.480
hundreds of faces going up and
down agreeing with that stance,

01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:14.360
because that's a
well-known fact based

01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:16.585
on years of teaching BIO150.

01:12:16.585 --> 01:12:18.970
Yeah, languages
serve different ,

01:12:18.970 --> 01:12:20.760
functions and
different emotions,

01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:23.350
and different cognitions,
very intertwined.

01:12:23.350 --> 01:12:26.430
And at a true extreme,
interviewing somebody

01:12:26.430 --> 01:12:29.720
in their own language, even
if it is the same language

01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:31.570
that you ostensibly
share with them,

01:12:31.570 --> 01:12:35.310
you're not quite going to be
speaking the same language.

01:12:35.310 --> 01:12:38.880
Shifting now over to animals--
animal communication,

01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:40.790
and in what ways
is it completely

01:12:40.790 --> 01:12:42.310
distinct from what we do?

01:12:42.310 --> 01:12:44.460
And in what ways are
there major overlaps?

01:12:44.460 --> 01:12:46.540
It's going to be the
same sort of themes

01:12:46.540 --> 01:12:48.810
as with the sex lectures,
the aggression lectures,

01:12:48.810 --> 01:12:51.540
all sorts of things that
people used to think

01:12:51.540 --> 01:12:55.510
were unique to humans
turn out to be less so.

01:12:55.510 --> 01:12:58.730
For example, other species
show the building blocks

01:12:58.730 --> 01:13:00.450
of semanticity.

01:13:00.450 --> 01:13:05.480
Semanticity, the fact
that a discrete sound

01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:09.750
can have meaning, and meaning
distinctive enough that it

01:13:09.750 --> 01:13:11.810
is separate from emotion.

01:13:11.810 --> 01:13:13.280
We've already heard
a great example

01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:14.930
of this with the
vervet monkeys who

01:13:14.930 --> 01:13:17.950
could tell the difference
between a vocalization saying,

01:13:17.950 --> 01:13:20.400
something scary up
in the air, get down,

01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:23.560
and something scary down on
the ground, get up in the tree.

01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:27.060
These are in common in terms
of the emotional content.

01:13:27.060 --> 01:13:30.880
But in terms of the semanticity,
the factual information

01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:33.650
transmitted, they're
diametrically opposite.

01:13:33.650 --> 01:13:35.490
This is what a word is.

01:13:35.490 --> 01:13:37.790
It is communicating
a stable concept

01:13:37.790 --> 01:13:39.880
that is independent of emotion.

01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:42.970
Vervet monkeys have
the starts of that.

01:13:42.970 --> 01:13:45.770
It turns out chickens
do that as well.

01:13:45.770 --> 01:13:48.600
I have no idea what
chickens emote about.

01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:51.040
But they have
different types of ones

01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:53.420
that communicate
information about what

01:13:53.420 --> 01:13:56.360
they are being menaced
by-- again, predator stuff.

01:13:56.360 --> 01:14:01.340
Vervets, not only do they have
a vocalization for scary raptor

01:14:01.340 --> 01:14:04.130
up in the sky versus scary
snake down on the ground,

01:14:04.130 --> 01:14:06.880
but they have two
vocalizations for one of them.

01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:09.880
And I forget which,
they have a synonym.

01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:12.760
They have the building
blocks of synonyms.

01:14:12.760 --> 01:14:14.080
What else?

01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:16.380
Animals and their
communication systems

01:14:16.380 --> 01:14:18.170
somehow have
incorporated the fact

01:14:18.170 --> 01:14:21.620
that facial expressions
and auditory communication

01:14:21.620 --> 01:14:23.060
go hand in hand.

01:14:23.060 --> 01:14:24.440
How can you show this?

01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:25.920
Take a rhesus monkey.

01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:28.820
And show it a film clip
of another monkey making

01:14:28.820 --> 01:14:31.220
some vocalization with
the facial expression

01:14:31.220 --> 01:14:33.900
over and over, and then
some other facial expression

01:14:33.900 --> 01:14:37.000
and emotion where they tend
to go together vocalization.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:40.450
Now pop one up there where
the monkey that is watching

01:14:40.450 --> 01:14:43.630
is giving an alarm
vocalization, and a come

01:14:43.630 --> 01:14:45.790
groom me sort of smiley face.

01:14:45.790 --> 01:14:48.920
And the monkey is
immediately oriented.

01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:50.280
And heart rate increases.

01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:53.120
It knows that facial
expression doesn't

01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:55.160
go with that vocalization.

01:14:55.160 --> 01:14:59.370
It's incorporated multi-modal
pathways of communication

01:14:59.370 --> 01:15:00.607
like that.

01:15:00.607 --> 01:15:02.190
Something else that
used to be thought

01:15:02.190 --> 01:15:05.010
to be unique to
humans-- intentionality

01:15:05.010 --> 01:15:06.590
of communication.

01:15:06.590 --> 01:15:10.370
I am making this sound not
because I am terrified,

01:15:10.370 --> 01:15:13.360
because I am happy, because
I am hungry, whatever,

01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:16.050
where I would be making
that regardless of who else

01:15:16.050 --> 01:15:16.940
is around.

01:15:16.940 --> 01:15:19.700
I am going to communicate
something only

01:15:19.700 --> 01:15:24.110
if this person is around, but
not that one-- intentionality.

01:15:24.110 --> 01:15:27.990
And it turns out, you find
that in other species as well.

01:15:27.990 --> 01:15:30.610
You see that in
vervets, for example.

01:15:30.610 --> 01:15:33.520
Vervets will give alarm
calls much more readily

01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:35.770
when their relatives
are around, then when

01:15:35.770 --> 01:15:37.490
non-relatives are around.

01:15:37.490 --> 01:15:40.920
Squirrels will do the same
thing with alarm calls.

01:15:40.920 --> 01:15:43.500
And if squirrels have been
having aggressive interactions

01:15:43.500 --> 01:15:45.070
with some other
squirrel, they are

01:15:45.070 --> 01:15:48.610
less likely to give an alarm
call when a predator is around

01:15:48.610 --> 01:15:50.540
than if it was
somebody they liked.

01:15:50.540 --> 01:15:53.220
There is intentionality
in that realm.

01:15:53.220 --> 01:15:56.320
What's implicit in that,
at least some proto

01:15:56.320 --> 01:16:00.380
building block steps
of theory of mind.

01:16:00.380 --> 01:16:01.240
So what else?

01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:03.950
What things remain
unique in human language?

01:16:03.950 --> 01:16:06.834
Dramatic displacement--
that ability

01:16:06.834 --> 01:16:09.000
to talk about things on the
other side of the globe,

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.333
and things that never happened,
and imaginary whatevers,

01:16:11.333 --> 01:16:13.350
and philosophy,
the arbitrariness,

01:16:13.350 --> 01:16:15.960
the embedded clauses,
the recursiveness.

01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:19.000
And a very important thing
about human language,

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:22.360
pretty uniquely--
the capacity to lie.

01:16:22.360 --> 01:16:25.400
And that has to do
with the arbitrariness.

01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:26.520
You are human.

01:16:26.520 --> 01:16:29.440
And you are in some
confrontational situation.

01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:31.750
And you are terrified
out of your wits.

01:16:31.750 --> 01:16:34.440
And the last thing you
would do is say, oh my,

01:16:34.440 --> 01:16:36.627
I am terrified out of my
wits, because you do not

01:16:36.627 --> 01:16:38.210
want to have the
other individual know

01:16:38.210 --> 01:16:39.420
that you are terrified.

01:16:39.420 --> 01:16:40.610
What do you do?

01:16:40.610 --> 01:16:46.520
You suppress the expression of
emotionally revealing language.

01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:50.910
Or you can even do something
like start chest thumping,

01:16:50.910 --> 01:16:54.180
and say all sorts of things
implying anything but fear--

01:16:54.180 --> 01:16:58.230
and, in fact, sort of
bullying pugnacity.

01:16:58.230 --> 01:17:00.890
And they're you're
lying as well.

01:17:00.890 --> 01:17:03.450
Humans have the
capacity to do that.

01:17:03.450 --> 01:17:06.930
A dog who is terrified
is going to be terrified.

01:17:06.930 --> 01:17:09.140
An animal that has
a strong emotion

01:17:09.140 --> 01:17:12.250
is going to give off pheromonal
signals, for example,

01:17:12.250 --> 01:17:15.210
depending on the species, that
communicates it, no matter

01:17:15.210 --> 01:17:16.960
how much that is
not the thing they

01:17:16.960 --> 01:17:18.620
want to be doing at the time.

01:17:18.620 --> 01:17:20.910
And here's a great
example of it.

01:17:20.910 --> 01:17:23.140
You take a dog,
one that's scared.

01:17:23.140 --> 01:17:24.937
And it doesn't want to
let an opponent know

01:17:24.937 --> 01:17:27.020
that it's scared if this
is some sort of dominance

01:17:27.020 --> 01:17:28.000
confrontation.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:29.580
And what it's doing
if it's scared

01:17:29.580 --> 01:17:33.300
is it's pumping out scared
pheromones-- pheromones

01:17:33.300 --> 01:17:36.190
with high levels of breakdown
products, of stress hormones.

01:17:36.190 --> 01:17:37.240
We know this already.

01:17:37.240 --> 01:17:38.390
It's pumping them out.

01:17:38.390 --> 01:17:40.650
And that's the last thing
it wants to be doing.

01:17:40.650 --> 01:17:43.780
It would love to be able
to lie and say, no, I'm

01:17:43.780 --> 01:17:44.820
not scared at all.

01:17:44.820 --> 01:17:47.340
But it can't do it
because there is not

01:17:47.340 --> 01:17:51.470
an arbitrary relationship
between being scared

01:17:51.470 --> 01:17:52.830
and how it's communicated.

01:17:52.830 --> 01:17:54.450
They are intertwined.

01:17:54.450 --> 01:17:58.240
The same phenomenon of the
scaredness is the signal of it.

01:17:58.240 --> 01:18:01.050
They can't prevent the
pheromones from coming out,

01:18:01.050 --> 01:18:02.700
in terms of shutting
down the glands.

01:18:02.700 --> 01:18:05.680
So what does a dog
do when it's scared

01:18:05.680 --> 01:18:08.360
and it's giving off all
these scared pheromones

01:18:08.360 --> 01:18:09.690
from its anal glands?

01:18:09.690 --> 01:18:12.040
It tries to shut
down the glands.

01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:14.660
It tucks its tail
between its legs.

01:18:14.660 --> 01:18:17.480
It tries to cover up
the pheromone release.

01:18:17.480 --> 01:18:19.570
And what does a dog
do when its perfectly

01:18:19.570 --> 01:18:22.670
content, and perfectly willing
to let the rest of the world

01:18:22.670 --> 01:18:24.270
know how its feeling
about things?

01:18:24.270 --> 01:18:26.980
It wants to spread those
pheromones around it.

01:18:26.980 --> 01:18:28.750
It rags its tail.

01:18:28.750 --> 01:18:30.240
Dogs can't lie.

01:18:30.240 --> 01:18:33.204
All they can do is try to put
their hand over their mouth.

01:18:33.204 --> 01:18:35.120
When they're about to
say something revealing,

01:18:35.120 --> 01:18:37.380
they tuck their tail
between their legs.

01:18:37.380 --> 01:18:41.930
So humans retain
this capacity to lie.

01:18:41.930 --> 01:18:44.745
Now, in terms of other
species and what they can do,

01:18:44.745 --> 01:18:49.540
what we transition to is a
really interesting subfield

01:18:49.540 --> 01:18:51.720
of this whole subject,
which is attempts

01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:55.020
to teach human languages
to other species--

01:18:55.020 --> 01:18:57.780
attempts to teach language
to other primates.

01:18:57.780 --> 01:19:00.430
And that has a long
and storied past,

01:19:00.430 --> 01:19:02.840
with all sorts of
disastrous outcomes

01:19:02.840 --> 01:19:06.140
and huge controversies
getting at this issue of,

01:19:06.140 --> 01:19:08.810
what sort of cognitive
aspects of language

01:19:08.810 --> 01:19:11.280
do we potentially share
with another species?

01:19:11.280 --> 01:19:13.715
OK, all of this has
been with chimps

01:19:13.715 --> 01:19:15.940
up until the last
20 years or so.

01:19:15.940 --> 01:19:19.270
And it started off
with a poor chimp

01:19:19.270 --> 01:19:23.500
named Vicki who belonged to send
researchers back in the 1930s.

01:19:23.500 --> 01:19:25.100
And I forget who and where.

01:19:25.100 --> 01:19:27.120
And what they
decided was they were

01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:32.130
going to teach Vicki to
speak English, naturally,

01:19:32.130 --> 01:19:33.066
and to speak.

01:19:33.066 --> 01:19:34.440
And how were they
going to do it?

01:19:34.440 --> 01:19:38.210
Using the then cutting edge,
just emerging principles

01:19:38.210 --> 01:19:41.850
of behaviorism, Vicki was
subject to behaviorist rules.

01:19:41.850 --> 01:19:44.630
If she wanted water,
she would have

01:19:44.630 --> 01:19:46.950
to make a sound
that vaguely sort of

01:19:46.950 --> 01:19:49.190
sounded like the word cup.

01:19:49.190 --> 01:19:53.150
She'd have to make this sort of
exhaling, barky sort of thing,

01:19:53.150 --> 01:19:56.070
which if your imagination
really ran away with you,

01:19:56.070 --> 01:19:57.820
would sound like the word cup.

01:19:57.820 --> 01:20:00.230
There were a few other
one syllable words

01:20:00.230 --> 01:20:02.030
were they wouldn't
feed her unless she

01:20:02.030 --> 01:20:05.580
made whatever sound they said
was close to the word food.

01:20:05.580 --> 01:20:09.190
This was one screwed
up chimp, in terms

01:20:09.190 --> 01:20:10.650
of seeing films of this chimp.

01:20:10.650 --> 01:20:13.760
This was one incredibly
neurotic animal.

01:20:13.760 --> 01:20:16.120
And thank God, after
only a few years,

01:20:16.120 --> 01:20:19.060
the researchers decided, you
know, this isn't working.

01:20:19.060 --> 01:20:20.900
And this poor animal
was allowed not to have

01:20:20.900 --> 01:20:22.630
to go through this anymore.

01:20:22.630 --> 01:20:24.790
Oh, this doesn't work.

01:20:24.790 --> 01:20:28.350
Soon after that, there
was another chimp

01:20:28.350 --> 01:20:30.430
that had one of these
sorts of upbringings.

01:20:30.430 --> 01:20:33.470
And this was raised by a
psychologist named Kellogg

01:20:33.470 --> 01:20:35.220
at, I believe, Yale.

01:20:35.220 --> 01:20:37.460
And what this person
was oriented to

01:20:37.460 --> 01:20:41.290
was Judith Rich Harris'
work on peer influences,

01:20:41.290 --> 01:20:44.580
even though she wasn't born yet,
the notion of peer influences.

01:20:44.580 --> 01:20:47.180
Why couldn't Vicki
learn English?

01:20:47.180 --> 01:20:49.780
Because she didn't have a peer.

01:20:49.780 --> 01:20:52.330
You need to have a chimp
grow up with a human.

01:20:52.330 --> 01:20:53.790
The two of them
growing up together

01:20:53.790 --> 01:20:56.500
with the exact same
environment and same treatment,

01:20:56.500 --> 01:20:59.840
and the human who's really
good at acquiring language,

01:20:59.840 --> 01:21:01.430
the chimp then will
have a peer, will

01:21:01.430 --> 01:21:03.804
have a role model, all of
that, and we'll pick up English

01:21:03.804 --> 01:21:04.540
as well.

01:21:04.540 --> 01:21:08.650
And, thus, the Kelloggs
raised their child, Donald.

01:21:08.650 --> 01:21:11.000
Donald was raised
with this chimp.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:12.610
And I'm forgetting
the chimp's name.

01:21:12.610 --> 01:21:16.580
But Donald fared almost
as poorly as Vicki.

01:21:16.580 --> 01:21:20.790
And they did this whole
study on the acquisition,

01:21:20.790 --> 01:21:23.200
and studies of the two,
and these whole books

01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:26.439
written about Donald and
his chimp brother there.

01:21:26.439 --> 01:21:27.980
And what was supposed
to be happening

01:21:27.980 --> 01:21:31.166
was the chimp was going to
learn English from Donald.

01:21:31.166 --> 01:21:32.540
And what you saw
developmentally,

01:21:32.540 --> 01:21:35.310
the chimp, of course,
was miles ahead of him.

01:21:35.310 --> 01:21:38.710
The chimp was climbing trees
while Donald was still cruising

01:21:38.710 --> 01:21:40.980
on the couch kind of thing.

01:21:40.980 --> 01:21:45.090
But in terms of language stuff,
it never went that direction.

01:21:45.090 --> 01:21:47.640
What wound up
happening was Donald

01:21:47.640 --> 01:21:51.040
started making vocalizations
of the chimp, at which point

01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:53.320
his parents stopped
the experiment.

01:21:53.320 --> 01:21:55.092
But this was totally nutty.

01:21:55.092 --> 01:21:56.550
They were doing
things-- like, they

01:21:56.550 --> 01:22:00.030
did this experiment on auditory
acuity in the two of them.

01:22:00.030 --> 01:22:01.750
You could see this in the book.

01:22:01.750 --> 01:22:02.590
They filmed them.

01:22:02.590 --> 01:22:05.780
There's Donald, and I believe
the chimp's name was Gua.

01:22:05.780 --> 01:22:08.070
And the two of them were
sitting there being perfectly

01:22:08.070 --> 01:22:09.430
happy sitting on the lawn.

01:22:09.430 --> 01:22:11.790
And they're were being
filmed, high speed film.

01:22:11.790 --> 01:22:13.940
And what does the
damn father do?

01:22:13.940 --> 01:22:17.350
He sneaks up behind them
with a starter's pistol

01:22:17.350 --> 01:22:21.580
and shoots it so that they can
get on film which one of them

01:22:21.580 --> 01:22:24.800
has the faster reaction time of
being scared out of their wits

01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:27.630
by their father shooting
this thing behind them.

01:22:27.630 --> 01:22:29.100
And what do you know?

01:22:29.100 --> 01:22:31.960
Gua had slightly faster
panic reaction stuff.

01:22:31.960 --> 01:22:35.620
So this was something that,
fortunately, hit a wall.

01:22:35.620 --> 01:22:40.900
And Donald, I believe, wound up
having a very interesting life.

01:22:40.900 --> 01:22:43.720
And I don't think it
was urban legends.

01:22:43.720 --> 01:22:44.970
I wish I remembered.

01:22:44.970 --> 01:22:46.620
But it made perfect
sense, given what

01:22:46.620 --> 01:22:48.580
a bizarre childhood he had.

01:22:48.580 --> 01:22:52.880
OK, soon people realized
they, or not so soon, then

01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:55.530
in the 1960s some
researchers finally

01:22:55.530 --> 01:22:57.760
realized what the
problem was with this,

01:22:57.760 --> 01:23:01.530
which is it is absurd thinking
that a chimp is going to learn

01:23:01.530 --> 01:23:05.340
how to speak a language
because they simply do not

01:23:05.340 --> 01:23:07.870
have the larynx that can do it.

01:23:07.870 --> 01:23:10.560
They do not have the
larynx that could produce

01:23:10.560 --> 01:23:12.080
discrete sounds like that.

01:23:12.080 --> 01:23:13.209
It's impossible.

01:23:13.209 --> 01:23:14.750
Not because they're
not smart enough,

01:23:14.750 --> 01:23:17.620
but they simply don't
have the anatomy to do it.

01:23:17.620 --> 01:23:19.820
And, thus, this was
a couple, University

01:23:19.820 --> 01:23:23.090
of Nevada named the
Gardeners, who came up

01:23:23.090 --> 01:23:27.190
with the brilliantly creative
idea of teaching a chimp

01:23:27.190 --> 01:23:32.090
American Sign Language to
bypass the vocal limitations,

01:23:32.090 --> 01:23:33.430
and just get at a system.

01:23:33.430 --> 01:23:35.890
Chimps have great
manual dexterity.

01:23:35.890 --> 01:23:38.240
Tap at the cognitive
aspects of language.

01:23:38.240 --> 01:23:41.280
Bypass the sound
vocals business.

01:23:41.280 --> 01:23:43.750
And, thus, came the
first sign language

01:23:43.750 --> 01:23:46.870
ape, a chimp named Washoe.

01:23:46.870 --> 01:23:51.650
Washoe was the
darling of linguists,

01:23:51.650 --> 01:23:54.640
psycholinguists a while,
because there was something so,

01:23:54.640 --> 01:23:57.730
so cool about a chimpanzee
sitting there being

01:23:57.730 --> 01:23:59.990
able to sign in sign language.

01:23:59.990 --> 01:24:03.130
Washoe, by the time she was
about a half dozen years old,

01:24:03.130 --> 01:24:06.500
had acquired about 150
different signs in English.

01:24:06.500 --> 01:24:09.020
And she could communicate
with the Gardeners with it.

01:24:09.020 --> 01:24:12.770
And people were producing
these glowing sorts

01:24:12.770 --> 01:24:14.770
of articles about them.

01:24:14.770 --> 01:24:16.940
I remember this one
guy, a science writer,

01:24:16.940 --> 01:24:20.380
who happened to
have deaf parents.

01:24:20.380 --> 01:24:23.440
So he was raised bilingual with
both English and American Sign

01:24:23.440 --> 01:24:24.050
Language.

01:24:24.050 --> 01:24:26.890
And this article about
going to visit Washoe,

01:24:26.890 --> 01:24:29.970
and the bizarrity of
speaking to a chimpanzee

01:24:29.970 --> 01:24:31.440
in his native language.

01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:33.280
And how cool is that?

01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:37.100
And Washoe was being
reported to do a hallmark

01:24:37.100 --> 01:24:38.920
feature of language
use, which is

01:24:38.920 --> 01:24:43.730
to begin to invent words,
where she combined the word

01:24:43.730 --> 01:24:46.440
water and the sign
language for bird,

01:24:46.440 --> 01:24:48.310
put them together,
to water bird.

01:24:48.310 --> 01:24:50.360
And that's what
she called ducks.

01:24:50.360 --> 01:24:51.100
Oh my God.

01:24:51.100 --> 01:24:52.990
She's made a new term.

01:24:52.990 --> 01:24:54.160
She babbled.

01:24:54.160 --> 01:24:57.310
Before going to sleep, she
would do her favorite signs

01:24:57.310 --> 01:24:59.990
to herself, and babble
herself to sleep.

01:24:59.990 --> 01:25:04.831
She used sign language to lie,
and to do all sorts of stuff

01:25:04.831 --> 01:25:06.080
she shouldn't have been doing.

01:25:06.080 --> 01:25:09.860
And Washoe lived in this
trailer on the campus there.

01:25:09.860 --> 01:25:13.567
And they often had this video
camera up at night filming her.

01:25:13.567 --> 01:25:15.150
And they would have
a low light there.

01:25:15.150 --> 01:25:18.010
And every now and then
you would see things like,

01:25:18.010 --> 01:25:19.740
there was a refrigerator there.

01:25:19.740 --> 01:25:22.740
And Washoe was not supposed
to open up the refrigerator

01:25:22.740 --> 01:25:24.390
and steal food out
of it at night.

01:25:24.390 --> 01:25:26.120
And, suddenly, the
camera is there.

01:25:26.120 --> 01:25:28.600
And the trailer is
absolutely quiet and empty.

01:25:28.600 --> 01:25:32.370
And, suddenly, you see Washoe
walking across, signing,

01:25:32.370 --> 01:25:36.710
saying, quiet, Washoe,
quiet, Washoe, and raiding

01:25:36.710 --> 01:25:40.680
the refrigerator that
way-- totally cool stuff.

01:25:40.680 --> 01:25:43.570
They brought in a second
chimp, a second chimp,

01:25:43.570 --> 01:25:46.830
to have Washoe and the chimp
start learning sign language,

01:25:46.830 --> 01:25:48.360
and start talking to each other.

01:25:48.360 --> 01:25:50.010
And a couple of
months into it, they

01:25:50.010 --> 01:25:52.350
had the first conversation
in sign language

01:25:52.350 --> 01:25:54.660
ever by another species.

01:25:54.660 --> 01:25:56.820
The two chimps were
sitting there, and facing

01:25:56.820 --> 01:25:58.310
in opposite directions.

01:25:58.310 --> 01:26:01.830
And they both made use of what
in every one of these projects

01:26:01.830 --> 01:26:04.800
was the first word that
any chimp ever mastered,

01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:08.810
which was tickle, because
chimps love to be tickled.

01:26:08.810 --> 01:26:10.830
And the first sentence
they ever mastered

01:26:10.830 --> 01:26:14.220
would always be
tickle me, tickle me.

01:26:14.220 --> 01:26:17.920
So there's the two of them,
sitting Washoe and Bowie

01:26:17.920 --> 01:26:19.300
I believe his name was.

01:26:19.300 --> 01:26:23.850
And Washoe says, tickle me.

01:26:23.850 --> 01:26:26.540
And Bowie says, tickle me.

01:26:26.540 --> 01:26:30.000
And Washoe, tickle
me, me, me, me, me.

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.060
And Bowie says, tickle
me, tickle me, tickle me.

01:26:32.060 --> 01:26:34.130
And, finally, the two of
them get up and walk off

01:26:34.130 --> 01:26:35.700
in opposite directions.

01:26:35.700 --> 01:26:39.300
There you have failed detente
in the very first conversation

01:26:39.300 --> 01:26:39.800
there.

01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:42.700
So my God, they're even
talking to each other.

01:26:42.700 --> 01:26:45.260
This is totally cool.

01:26:45.260 --> 01:26:47.860
Meanwhile, a guy at the
University of Pennsylvania

01:26:47.860 --> 01:26:51.000
named David Premack had
his chimp named Sarah.

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:54.120
And he was very irritated
about the imprecision

01:26:54.120 --> 01:26:55.280
of sign language.

01:26:55.280 --> 01:27:00.940
He was teaching Sarah
a symbolic language

01:27:00.940 --> 01:27:03.570
pattern of different
shaped magnetic tiles,

01:27:03.570 --> 01:27:07.920
and showing very rigorously
that Sarah could do if-then type

01:27:07.920 --> 01:27:11.020
clauses, could begin
to do embedded clauses,

01:27:11.020 --> 01:27:13.430
saying things like,
he would put up

01:27:13.430 --> 01:27:18.810
the sign saying, if the
red ball is in the bucket,

01:27:18.810 --> 01:27:24.120
go hoot crazily in joy.

01:27:24.120 --> 01:27:26.490
And Sarah would be
able to do this, and be

01:27:26.490 --> 01:27:29.860
able to construct these as
well-- nothing very much

01:27:29.860 --> 01:27:31.640
resembling the
fluidity of language,

01:27:31.640 --> 01:27:36.220
but nonetheless showing really
sophisticated structure to it.

01:27:36.220 --> 01:27:38.010
So these guys were
rolling along.

01:27:38.010 --> 01:27:39.810
And everybody loved this.

01:27:39.810 --> 01:27:41.970
And this was the
greatest stuff ever,

01:27:41.970 --> 01:27:44.680
chimps speaking
American Sign Language.

01:27:44.680 --> 01:27:48.530
And you could hang out
with them, and tickle them.

01:27:48.530 --> 01:27:51.140
And they'd never tickle
you back, apparently.

01:27:51.140 --> 01:27:55.210
But showing interviewing an
animal in its own language,

01:27:55.210 --> 01:27:58.640
none of that reciprocity of
tickling stuff with a human.

01:27:58.640 --> 01:28:01.940
But then, then,
along came the ape

01:28:01.940 --> 01:28:04.230
to end all apes
when it came to sign

01:28:04.230 --> 01:28:08.340
language, Koko,
Koko the gorilla.

01:28:08.340 --> 01:28:12.830
Koko the gorilla started off her
linguistic life here on campus.

01:28:12.830 --> 01:28:16.250
Koko was originally a gorilla
up in the San Francisco Zoo.

01:28:16.250 --> 01:28:19.980
And a graduate student, by
now I can't remember how

01:28:19.980 --> 01:28:22.990
many decades ago, named Penny
Patterson in the psychology

01:28:22.990 --> 01:28:25.770
department decided that
for a bunch of reasons

01:28:25.770 --> 01:28:28.280
gorillas were going to
be a lot more focused.

01:28:28.280 --> 01:28:31.515
Compared to gorillas,
chimps all have ADD.

01:28:31.515 --> 01:28:33.390
And Koko was going
to be the one.

01:28:33.390 --> 01:28:35.310
And she managed to
get a loan of Koko

01:28:35.310 --> 01:28:37.660
from the San Francisco Zoo.

01:28:37.660 --> 01:28:41.130
And apparently during that
era, like half the days

01:28:41.130 --> 01:28:42.880
you could be going
around campus and there

01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:45.540
would be Koko going by
on a bicycle with Penny

01:28:45.540 --> 01:28:47.305
Patterson or some such thing.

01:28:47.305 --> 01:28:51.110
So Koko is this baby growing up
here on campus, totally cool.

01:28:51.110 --> 01:28:54.240
Koko begins to learn
American Sign Language.

01:28:54.240 --> 01:28:58.510
And that was clear was this
was the ape of all time when

01:28:58.510 --> 01:29:00.650
it came to learning
American Sign Language.

01:29:00.650 --> 01:29:02.600
Koko was amazing.

01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:04.480
Koko was learning stuff.

01:29:04.480 --> 01:29:07.130
Patterson was reporting the
most astonishing things.

01:29:07.130 --> 01:29:09.900
Koko could report dreams.

01:29:09.900 --> 01:29:12.440
Koko could gossip,
could gossip as

01:29:12.440 --> 01:29:14.810
in there would be two
people on the project

01:29:14.810 --> 01:29:17.900
who, like, had a fight in
front of her in the morning.

01:29:17.900 --> 01:29:21.430
And later in the day, she could
tell one of the other humans

01:29:21.430 --> 01:29:25.390
that the two of them were having
some fight thing or whatever.

01:29:25.390 --> 01:29:28.840
Koko could gossip in
American Sign Language.

01:29:28.840 --> 01:29:30.550
Koko could do anything.

01:29:30.550 --> 01:29:33.300
Koko could philosophize.

01:29:33.300 --> 01:29:36.840
Koko could lie like
crazy, of course,

01:29:36.840 --> 01:29:38.560
because all of these
chimps and apes

01:29:38.560 --> 01:29:40.370
immediately began
lying like crazy.

01:29:40.370 --> 01:29:42.840
Here's one of the things
she was reported as doing.

01:29:42.840 --> 01:29:44.690
So Koko is left
alone in this room.

01:29:44.690 --> 01:29:47.940
And there's a
potted plant there.

01:29:47.940 --> 01:29:49.090
And nobody's around.

01:29:49.090 --> 01:29:50.910
And Koko being a gorilla,
what does she do?

01:29:50.910 --> 01:29:51.570
She looks around.

01:29:51.570 --> 01:29:52.445
There's nobody there.

01:29:52.445 --> 01:29:54.520
So she eats the plant.

01:29:54.520 --> 01:29:58.190
So after a while, in
comes Patterson, and says,

01:29:58.190 --> 01:30:00.620
what happened, in sign
language, to the plant?

01:30:00.620 --> 01:30:02.050
Where's the plant?

01:30:02.050 --> 01:30:05.240
And Koko, who has
been caught red-handed

01:30:05.240 --> 01:30:09.220
here, Koko says, Bill ate it.

01:30:09.220 --> 01:30:11.910
Bill, the poor bastard grad
student on the project,

01:30:11.910 --> 01:30:13.850
oh, blame the grad student.

01:30:13.850 --> 01:30:17.980
So Patterson says,
don't tell me that.

01:30:17.980 --> 01:30:18.990
Bill's not a gorilla.

01:30:18.990 --> 01:30:20.640
Humans don't eat plants.

01:30:20.640 --> 01:30:22.240
Gorillas only eat plants.

01:30:22.240 --> 01:30:27.130
And Koko sits there and
says, some other gorilla,

01:30:27.130 --> 01:30:28.710
some other gorilla.

01:30:28.710 --> 01:30:30.210
So this was amazing.

01:30:30.210 --> 01:30:31.940
Koko was just the best.

01:30:31.940 --> 01:30:37.950
So, suddenly, Koko was like
double dating with Madonna,

01:30:37.950 --> 01:30:42.020
and endorsing [INAUDIBLE],
and aerobic exercises,

01:30:42.020 --> 01:30:44.620
and the Koko diet, and
things of that sort.

01:30:44.620 --> 01:30:45.990
And it was totally great.

01:30:45.990 --> 01:30:48.610
And this was the
best gorilla ever.

01:30:48.610 --> 01:30:50.080
And this was the best ape.

01:30:50.080 --> 01:30:52.020
And they brought
in this male who

01:30:52.020 --> 01:30:54.200
was supposed to,
like, knock up Koko

01:30:54.200 --> 01:30:56.820
so that she could have a
baby and teach her baby sign

01:30:56.820 --> 01:30:59.840
language, a multi-generational
gorilla teaching

01:30:59.840 --> 01:31:01.440
philosophy to their children.

01:31:01.440 --> 01:31:02.840
And all of this was great.

01:31:02.840 --> 01:31:07.540
And then around 1980
all of it got ruined.

01:31:07.540 --> 01:31:12.130
And it got ruined by a guy at
Columbia named Herb Terrace.

01:31:12.130 --> 01:31:14.890
Terrace had been another
one of the ones starting

01:31:14.890 --> 01:31:18.020
one of the sign
language chimp projects.

01:31:18.020 --> 01:31:20.820
And he started with
a chimp who was

01:31:20.820 --> 01:31:24.770
going to disprove Noam Chomsky,
who argued that there was

01:31:24.770 --> 01:31:27.390
no way anything that these
chimps and gorillas could do

01:31:27.390 --> 01:31:29.350
would actually
count as language.

01:31:29.350 --> 01:31:31.300
He was going to prove him wrong.

01:31:31.300 --> 01:31:34.690
With his chimp who,
he named Nim Chimpsky,

01:31:34.690 --> 01:31:36.220
to disprove Noam Chomsky.

01:31:36.220 --> 01:31:38.070
So there was Nim Chimpsky.

01:31:38.070 --> 01:31:42.740
And Nim Chimpsky starts
learning American Sign Language,

01:31:42.740 --> 01:31:44.030
like all the other ones.

01:31:44.030 --> 01:31:46.540
And Nim Chimpsky,
as opposed to, like,

01:31:46.540 --> 01:31:49.300
Washoe, who's living out there
in the American West, and

01:31:49.300 --> 01:31:51.450
manifest destiny
and all of that,

01:31:51.450 --> 01:31:53.980
Nim Chimpsky lived in a
townhouse up on the west side

01:31:53.980 --> 01:31:58.240
of Manhattan, and was
a regular favorite

01:31:58.240 --> 01:32:00.872
at Lincoln Center, and
Zabar's and all of that.

01:32:00.872 --> 01:32:02.580
And the person who
got the bagel probably

01:32:02.580 --> 01:32:04.870
knows what I'm referring
to, but nobody else does.

01:32:04.870 --> 01:32:07.120
And Nim was just
growing up there,

01:32:07.120 --> 01:32:08.280
and learning sign language.

01:32:08.280 --> 01:32:09.500
And Nim was great.

01:32:09.500 --> 01:32:11.650
And Nim was terrific,
and learning just as fast

01:32:11.650 --> 01:32:12.500
as the other ones.

01:32:12.500 --> 01:32:15.590
And, actually, the summer
after my freshman year,

01:32:15.590 --> 01:32:19.610
I spent the summer working with
Nim, which was incredible fun,

01:32:19.610 --> 01:32:22.610
and tickling him, and
him not tickling me back.

01:32:22.610 --> 01:32:25.900
And it was all so exciting,
and getting to do this

01:32:25.900 --> 01:32:27.882
all day long with a chimp.

01:32:27.882 --> 01:32:30.160
And moving on, and
then Terrace and crew

01:32:30.160 --> 01:32:31.520
beginning to expand on this.

01:32:31.520 --> 01:32:34.640
And then, suddenly,
about three years later,

01:32:34.640 --> 01:32:38.320
out comes this big
landmark paper in Science

01:32:38.320 --> 01:32:40.100
by Terrace and some
of the colleagues

01:32:40.100 --> 01:32:43.610
there basically
saying, you know what?

01:32:43.610 --> 01:32:45.250
Nim is totally cool.

01:32:45.250 --> 01:32:48.262
And he is a blast to
spend a long weekend with,

01:32:48.262 --> 01:32:49.220
and that sort of thing.

01:32:49.220 --> 01:32:52.200
But he's not learning language.

01:32:52.200 --> 01:32:54.020
This really doesn't count.

01:32:54.020 --> 01:32:55.060
And you know what?

01:32:55.060 --> 01:32:57.480
None of the other
ones are either.

01:32:57.480 --> 01:33:02.190
And what you had was the
first real hard-assed analysis

01:33:02.190 --> 01:33:04.040
of what these animals
were producing.

01:33:04.040 --> 01:33:07.860
And what Terrace demonstrated
in this paper in great detail

01:33:07.860 --> 01:33:12.380
was nothing Nim was doing fit
the criteria for language.

01:33:12.380 --> 01:33:15.140
Nim was not inventing words.

01:33:15.140 --> 01:33:18.260
Nim was not getting
word ordering correct.

01:33:18.260 --> 01:33:21.330
Word ordering was basically
at the random level.

01:33:21.330 --> 01:33:24.520
Me eat, and eat me,
50% chance of either

01:33:24.520 --> 01:33:26.580
when expressing the same notion.

01:33:26.580 --> 01:33:28.950
Nim was failing to
do something that

01:33:28.950 --> 01:33:31.410
was very fundamental
to language,

01:33:31.410 --> 01:33:35.830
which was the more words in your
string, the more meaning to it.

01:33:35.830 --> 01:33:38.100
And what I have on the
handout at the very top

01:33:38.100 --> 01:33:40.820
was some famous quote
from Nim who was just

01:33:40.820 --> 01:33:43.170
babbling on
something incoherent,

01:33:43.170 --> 01:33:45.160
suggesting like a
Broca's aphasia,

01:33:45.160 --> 01:33:46.450
except that he was fine.

01:33:46.450 --> 01:33:49.340
As the utterances
got longer, they

01:33:49.340 --> 01:33:51.930
didn't contain more information.

01:33:51.930 --> 01:33:55.710
Moreover, the utterances
were not spontaneous.

01:33:55.710 --> 01:33:58.940
Language is not about
answering questions.

01:33:58.940 --> 01:34:01.830
Language is about
choosing to communicate.

01:34:01.830 --> 01:34:04.450
Nim was not generating
any of this.

01:34:04.450 --> 01:34:07.280
He was responding to,
if you answer this,

01:34:07.280 --> 01:34:10.277
you will get a fruit loop,
which is what he mainly ate.

01:34:10.277 --> 01:34:12.110
And, thus, most of the
people on the project

01:34:12.110 --> 01:34:15.330
were constantly stealing
his fruit loops from him.

01:34:15.330 --> 01:34:17.450
So this looked pretty bad.

01:34:17.450 --> 01:34:19.250
And what Terrace
then proceeded to do

01:34:19.250 --> 01:34:22.270
was the same analysis on
all the other projects.

01:34:22.270 --> 01:34:25.310
And none of the chimps
were doing anything.

01:34:25.310 --> 01:34:27.700
All of them were failing
these same criteria

01:34:27.700 --> 01:34:30.700
of accurate word
ordering, expanded

01:34:30.700 --> 01:34:33.780
meaning with longer utterances,
spontaneous, all of that.

01:34:33.780 --> 01:34:38.050
Washoe, oh, coming up,
the duck is a water bird.

01:34:38.050 --> 01:34:42.800
Washoe was saying, water, bird.

01:34:42.800 --> 01:34:44.990
No, it had not just
neologistically come

01:34:44.990 --> 01:34:48.330
up-- if that's the word--
with a new word for duck

01:34:48.330 --> 01:34:49.885
in American Sign Language.

01:34:49.885 --> 01:34:50.760
It wasn't doing that.

01:34:50.760 --> 01:34:52.390
The word ordering made no sense.

01:34:52.390 --> 01:34:53.780
It was completely random.

01:34:53.780 --> 01:34:57.100
Terrace rips apart
the whole literature.

01:34:57.100 --> 01:35:00.780
So out of that emerges the
great, bloodied prizefight

01:35:00.780 --> 01:35:04.097
of 1983 between Terrace
and Penny Patterson.

01:35:04.097 --> 01:35:05.680
Penny Patterson, who
had by that point

01:35:05.680 --> 01:35:08.380
had stolen Koko from
the San Francisco Zoo--

01:35:08.380 --> 01:35:09.850
and you think I'm kidding.

01:35:09.850 --> 01:35:12.740
She had been promised Koko for
only a certain number of years.

01:35:12.740 --> 01:35:14.906
And then, of course, she
was going to give him back.

01:35:14.906 --> 01:35:17.830
And when it was time for her
to give him back, she said,

01:35:17.830 --> 01:35:20.940
I'm not giving him back because
he has human values now.

01:35:20.940 --> 01:35:23.620
And it would be unfair for
him to live with a gorilla.

01:35:23.620 --> 01:35:28.320
So that was just on the edge
of being a lawsuit built around

01:35:28.320 --> 01:35:30.460
whether or not Koko
could be emancipated

01:35:30.460 --> 01:35:32.530
along the lines of
having human values,

01:35:32.530 --> 01:35:35.110
because she had
been, like, skating

01:35:35.110 --> 01:35:38.790
on Lake Lagunita when it was
frozen, or things like that.

01:35:38.790 --> 01:35:41.760
And the San Francisco Zoo,
seeing a public relations

01:35:41.760 --> 01:35:44.760
disaster on the horizon,
decided, what the hell?

01:35:44.760 --> 01:35:48.310
Let's give Koko, let's
give this $60,000 gorilla

01:35:48.310 --> 01:35:50.570
to Penny Patterson,
who by that point

01:35:50.570 --> 01:35:53.520
had pretty much had her
association with Stanford cut,

01:35:53.520 --> 01:35:56.340
and by then was
up in the Woodside

01:35:56.340 --> 01:36:00.180
Hills at a large estate paid
for by gorilla enthusiasts,

01:36:00.180 --> 01:36:02.640
and hanging out there with Koko.

01:36:02.640 --> 01:36:06.450
So Patterson winds up being
the strongest defender

01:36:06.450 --> 01:36:10.100
down to the end that this
is real language that Coco

01:36:10.100 --> 01:36:11.020
is doing.

01:36:11.020 --> 01:36:14.610
And Terrace, going completely
after it-- and one problem

01:36:14.610 --> 01:36:17.720
at that point was there were
no actual data that had ever

01:36:17.720 --> 01:36:19.340
been published by Patterson.

01:36:19.340 --> 01:36:23.100
All there were, were some
several heartwarming films

01:36:23.100 --> 01:36:26.670
of Koko, Koko and
global warming,

01:36:26.670 --> 01:36:30.080
and Koko and the trade deficit,
and Koko and this or that.

01:36:30.080 --> 01:36:31.194
And there were no data.

01:36:31.194 --> 01:36:32.860
Scientists couldn't
make any sense of it

01:36:32.860 --> 01:36:34.580
because there were no numbers.

01:36:34.580 --> 01:36:37.270
There was no anything
you can actually analyze.

01:36:37.270 --> 01:36:38.970
And when you look at the films.

01:36:38.970 --> 01:36:41.060
And they would be pitiful.

01:36:41.060 --> 01:36:42.540
They would be pitiful.

01:36:42.540 --> 01:36:44.580
Koko would be sitting
there, for one thing,

01:36:44.580 --> 01:36:48.040
would never be generating
spontaneous utterances.

01:36:48.040 --> 01:36:51.270
Koko would be sitting there
having the same word order

01:36:51.270 --> 01:36:53.430
randomness as all the chimps.

01:36:53.430 --> 01:36:55.915
Koko would be having--
and part of the problem

01:36:55.915 --> 01:37:00.780
was Patterson kept
enabling Koko.

01:37:00.780 --> 01:37:02.890
She would ask Koko, what
do you call this thing?

01:37:02.890 --> 01:37:05.880
And Koko would come up with
a completely wrong sign.

01:37:05.880 --> 01:37:10.280
And Patterson would say,
oh, stop kidding around.

01:37:10.280 --> 01:37:14.300
And then Patterson would
show her the next one.

01:37:14.300 --> 01:37:16.580
And Koko would get
it completely wrong.

01:37:16.580 --> 01:37:21.630
And Patterson would say,
oh, you funny gorilla.

01:37:21.630 --> 01:37:23.900
And then-- I'm really serious.

01:37:23.900 --> 01:37:24.951
And I mean it this time.

01:37:24.951 --> 01:37:26.450
And so when she
gets it wrong again.

01:37:26.450 --> 01:37:29.090
And, oh, Koko, is
being so ironic.

01:37:29.090 --> 01:37:30.270
What?

01:37:30.270 --> 01:37:31.790
What are you talking about?

01:37:31.790 --> 01:37:34.570
She's going on like that
in these films here.

01:37:34.570 --> 01:37:37.680
And as you look closely
using the sort of criteria

01:37:37.680 --> 01:37:40.910
that Terrace was using,
your socks new more

01:37:40.910 --> 01:37:43.530
American Sign Language
than this gorilla did.

01:37:43.530 --> 01:37:45.850
it's showing none
of the spontaneity,

01:37:45.850 --> 01:37:48.600
none of the word ordering,
none of any of that stuff.

01:37:48.600 --> 01:37:50.110
So out came the knives.

01:37:50.110 --> 01:37:51.880
And here were the basic stances.

01:37:51.880 --> 01:37:54.370
Terrace's stance was
Patterson wouldn't

01:37:54.370 --> 01:37:59.000
know a controlled experiment
if it hit her over the head.

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.390
Patterson's response
was, Terrace

01:38:01.390 --> 01:38:04.740
was this cold, affectless
fish who had driven Nim

01:38:04.740 --> 01:38:06.990
into virtual autism.

01:38:06.990 --> 01:38:09.250
And this guy Terrace
was not someone

01:38:09.250 --> 01:38:12.710
who you would want to sort
of cozy up and on his lap

01:38:12.710 --> 01:38:15.562
and have him tell you
bedtime stories or whatever.

01:38:15.562 --> 01:38:19.320
And another feature that
Patterson pointed out very,

01:38:19.320 --> 01:38:23.650
very accurately was Nim had
no continuity of teachers.

01:38:23.650 --> 01:38:27.240
Nim had all sorts of people
who knew three and a half

01:38:27.240 --> 01:38:30.830
more words of sign language than
he did-- like me, for example--

01:38:30.830 --> 01:38:33.610
who would show up for a
summer, and then disappear.

01:38:33.610 --> 01:38:36.220
He was going through 20, 30
different teachers a year.

01:38:36.220 --> 01:38:40.300
Oh, that's not a very good
setting for learning stuff.

01:38:40.300 --> 01:38:41.830
That's not ideal.

01:38:41.830 --> 01:38:44.200
Language is not
just about language.

01:38:44.200 --> 01:38:46.570
It's about the
emotional relationships.

01:38:46.570 --> 01:38:49.270
And Nim ultimately wound up
being a pretty screwed up

01:38:49.270 --> 01:38:52.740
chimp in terms of like
nobody stable in his life

01:38:52.740 --> 01:38:54.690
except for this cold
fish Terrace who

01:38:54.690 --> 01:38:56.410
basically didn't like him.

01:38:56.410 --> 01:38:59.430
So it's going back and
forth, and these accusations.

01:38:59.430 --> 01:39:03.582
And Patterson coming out
with just incredible stuff,

01:39:03.582 --> 01:39:05.290
and Terrace going after her.

01:39:05.290 --> 01:39:09.950
And then things
got really dirty,

01:39:09.950 --> 01:39:12.670
Patterson beginning to
suggest that maybe Nim

01:39:12.670 --> 01:39:16.240
wasn't playing with a full deck
compared to the other-- oh,

01:39:16.240 --> 01:39:20.300
so Terrace got the stupidest
chimp in the entire literature

01:39:20.300 --> 01:39:23.320
there, and did the best
analysis on his inadequacies,

01:39:23.320 --> 01:39:27.260
and is trying to take down the
whole field-- totally messy,

01:39:27.260 --> 01:39:29.340
messy sort of conflict there.

01:39:29.340 --> 01:39:31.420
And pretty much the
whole field collapsed

01:39:31.420 --> 01:39:33.320
in the aftermath of it.

01:39:33.320 --> 01:39:35.460
Patterson is still up in
the hills of Woodside.

01:39:35.460 --> 01:39:37.210
Although I hear rumors
she's about to move

01:39:37.210 --> 01:39:39.700
to Hawaii with Koko
to a large estate

01:39:39.700 --> 01:39:42.630
that she's gotten
somebody to give her.

01:39:42.630 --> 01:39:48.066
She sends out things like
newsletters talking about Koko

01:39:48.066 --> 01:39:51.710
sends greetings for world
peace, and things of that sort.

01:39:51.710 --> 01:39:52.950
I met her once.

01:39:52.950 --> 01:39:56.045
And she wanted to talk
about this gorilla Michael

01:39:56.045 --> 01:39:58.950
was brought in who was
supposed to mate with her.

01:39:58.950 --> 01:40:01.570
But they brought him in
when he was too young.

01:40:01.570 --> 01:40:04.940
And they did a kibbutz brother
and sister deal instead,

01:40:04.940 --> 01:40:07.090
and just did folk
songs together.

01:40:07.090 --> 01:40:08.367
And Michael wasn't working.

01:40:08.367 --> 01:40:09.450
He wasn't mating with her.

01:40:09.450 --> 01:40:11.980
So they eventually brought
in this big, larger male.

01:40:11.980 --> 01:40:14.320
And Michael promptly
died of heart disease,

01:40:14.320 --> 01:40:17.820
which I thought probably had
a major stress component.

01:40:17.820 --> 01:40:19.510
And that seemed
perfectly legitimate,

01:40:19.510 --> 01:40:20.610
and was talking with that.

01:40:20.610 --> 01:40:23.140
And then was
informed that October

01:40:23.140 --> 01:40:26.070
is going to be really tough,
because the end of October

01:40:26.070 --> 01:40:27.750
is Michael's birthday.

01:40:27.750 --> 01:40:30.415
And Koko is going to have
a really hard-- saying,

01:40:30.415 --> 01:40:32.348
is anybody else hearing this?

01:40:32.348 --> 01:40:33.764
Am I the only one
hearing this who

01:40:33.764 --> 01:40:35.090
thinks something is off here?

01:40:35.090 --> 01:40:36.750
They have continued there.

01:40:36.750 --> 01:40:39.940
And Terrace pretty much took
down the rest of the field.

01:40:39.940 --> 01:40:42.020
In the aftermath, and
the remnants of it,

01:40:42.020 --> 01:40:45.060
there remains one chimp
who I think legitimately

01:40:45.060 --> 01:40:48.370
qualifies as using
something beginning

01:40:48.370 --> 01:40:50.380
to resemble true language.

01:40:50.380 --> 01:40:53.300
And this is a bonobo
chimp named Kanzi.

01:40:53.300 --> 01:40:55.630
And Kanzi, they are
doing everything right.

01:40:55.630 --> 01:40:59.390
It is clear that Kanzi
is incredibly smart.

01:40:59.390 --> 01:41:02.270
They are doing all
sorts of data analysis.

01:41:02.270 --> 01:41:04.320
And Kanzi is learning stuff.

01:41:04.320 --> 01:41:06.490
Kanzi is doing embedded clauses.

01:41:06.490 --> 01:41:09.920
Kanzi does if-then stuff,
logical progressions.

01:41:09.920 --> 01:41:12.040
Kanzi is able to do a
whole bunch of things.

01:41:12.040 --> 01:41:15.230
Kanzi can do analogy.

01:41:15.230 --> 01:41:19.790
Small ball is to small
bucket, as big ball is to--

01:41:19.790 --> 01:41:22.580
and she will
indicate big bucket.

01:41:22.580 --> 01:41:24.680
She can do analogies like that.

01:41:24.680 --> 01:41:27.540
And most intriguingly,
not only is Kanzi

01:41:27.540 --> 01:41:30.870
generating language, and
spontaneous and all of that,

01:41:30.870 --> 01:41:34.640
is that when Kanzi makes
mistakes identifying things,

01:41:34.640 --> 01:41:37.650
they tend to be within
semantic categories.

01:41:37.650 --> 01:41:40.650
She accidentally comes up
with the sign for apple

01:41:40.650 --> 01:41:42.610
when she means to say orange.

01:41:42.610 --> 01:41:44.830
She doesn't accidentally
come up with the sign

01:41:44.830 --> 01:41:47.930
for existentialism when
she means to say orange.

01:41:47.930 --> 01:41:51.410
It's semantic categories,
exactly the sort of stuff

01:41:51.410 --> 01:41:52.250
you need.

01:41:52.250 --> 01:41:55.822
So at this stage, most of that
field went down in flames.

01:41:55.822 --> 01:41:58.280
At one point, people were making
a big deal out of the fact

01:41:58.280 --> 01:42:01.490
that there's not a whole lot
of gorillas left on Earth.

01:42:01.490 --> 01:42:04.040
And when, supposedly,
Koko and Michael

01:42:04.040 --> 01:42:06.870
were able to be talking their
hearts out with each other,

01:42:06.870 --> 01:42:10.410
when you calculated those two
gorillas, and the total number

01:42:10.410 --> 01:42:13.680
of gorillas on Earth, and how
many people speak American Sign

01:42:13.680 --> 01:42:16.280
Language, and how many
people on Earth there are,

01:42:16.280 --> 01:42:18.990
a greater percentage
of Earth's gorillas

01:42:18.990 --> 01:42:21.970
were speaking American Sign
Language than Earth's humans.

01:42:21.970 --> 01:42:24.130
Like, that was stuff
coming out at that time.

01:42:24.130 --> 01:42:26.270
So the entire field
has collapsed.

01:42:26.270 --> 01:42:28.200
Kanzi remains
about the only hope

01:42:28.200 --> 01:42:30.040
for making sense of
anything going on

01:42:30.040 --> 01:42:33.982
with this-- really appealing,
seductive stuff, not

01:42:33.982 --> 01:42:34.940
a whole lot of science.

01:42:34.940 --> 01:42:37.850
OK, so what we will
pick up on on Wednesday

01:42:37.850 --> 01:42:41.383
is the genetics evolution
of language, and then--

01:42:42.150 --> 01:42:45.540

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:05.865
Stanford University.

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:13.440
Variety of announcements,
tomorrow, office hours

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.580
are shifted because
at 4:30, there's

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.220
a really interesting
lecture over at Clark.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.700
This guy is one of the
experts on the whole notion

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.570
that there are brain
metabolic abnormalities

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.080
in sociopathic humans,
violent criminals.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.050
He's got the distinction
of having the world's only

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:34.460
portable MRI.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.720
He has a big old Winnebago
with an MRI machine.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.560
And he drives all
around the country

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.640
from one maximum security
prison to another,

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.030
trying to look at aspects of
frontal cortical dysfunction

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.500
in extremely
violent individuals.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.500
I have no idea if he's
a good lecturer or not,

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.770
the material is going to
be really interesting.

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.670
So that's something
that probably should

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.760
be caught Friday,
again, is not going

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.430
to be videotape,
but just audiotape

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:02.600
for a number of reasons.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:08.970
Finally, over next
year, I will be doing,

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.780
if anyone is interested,
some directed readings

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.770
with people that are--
that will be essentially

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.690
more of an exploration of some
of the topics in the course

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:19.320
here.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.600
So if you are interested, do
not send me anything whatsoever

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.230
until it's the summer.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:30.650
At that point, CV, transcript,
anything I need to know,

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.070
but it will be posted
on the coursework,

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.680
so as to more details about it.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.980
So we pick up with the
homestretch here of language.

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.550
And what we got to just on
the edge of two days ago

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.620
is the now begin to look at
the genetics of language use.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.810
In general, there's the
usual types of techniques

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.350
for behavior genetics.

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.280
The first is looking
for covariance

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.140
of certain language
abnormalities

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.030
in certain families.

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.820
And the evidence for that is
clear with Williams syndrome,

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.280
with the selective
language impairment.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.340
Those tend to run
in families and they

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.170
tend to show classical
Mendelian inheritance,

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.130
very readily thought
of as genetically

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:15.890
influenced disorders.

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.660
Then, going to our
usual deal of looking

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.360
at adopted individuals, twins,
identical twins separated

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.700
at birth, that
whole armamentarium

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.620
of behavioral genetics
stuff, what does that show?

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.400
There's a fair degree
of heritability

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.700
of things like vocabulary
complexity, ability to spell,

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.230
skill at phonology,
things of that sort.

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.470
In general, the
evidence is pretty

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.266
poor for a strong genetic
load on dyslexias,

00:02:46.266 --> 00:02:49.520
on learning disorders
of that type.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.770
Of course, the
modern version of it

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.400
all is to start looking
at the actual genes,

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.270
the molecular biology of
language disorders, of language

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:59.290
in general.

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.180
First thing that
comes up is this gene

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.030
that has been at the center of
the whole field for years now,

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.890
a gene called FOXP2.

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.510
And it was originally
identified as having a mutation

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.050
in a family that had a very
specific linguistic problem

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.830
running through it,
language generation speech.

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:23.630
This family had severe
problems with it,

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.220
classic looking for
a genetic marker,

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.410
and eventually narrowing
down to the gene

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:34.340
itself, turning out to be this
mysterious gene FOXP2, which

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.430
turned out to be a
transcription factor,

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.600
and a mutation in
it in this family.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.590
What immediately became
clear is this theme

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.060
over and over again
with language,

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.610
in so far as there's a
problem in this family,

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.700
is it at the cognitive
level of what language

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.940
is about symbolically or is
it just getting your lips

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.970
and tongues and articulating
and that much more

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.250
mechanical level.

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.370
It initially looked
like it was much more

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.180
the latter in this family.

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.120
It is apparently more
of a mixture of both,

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.600
just to make things
really confusing.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.930
What you see is it
is preferentially

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.140
expressed in that
part of the brain

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.410
we heard about the other
day, the basal ganglia.

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.100
That area that's playing a
role in gesturing when you're

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.800
speaking, playing a
role in facial prosody,

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.340
that sort of stuff, motoric
stuff, and the fact that it was

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.790
found so heavily
expressed in there

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:32.370
was part of what got people
to think what's fundamentally

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.250
wrong with this family is motor
aspects of language production.

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.400
Again, it's gotten
messier since then

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.510
because these folks
have a variety

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:45.870
of cognitive impairments
in the realm of language.

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.700
So, of course, immediately,
what we need to be asking

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:52.260
is what's FOXP2 doing
in other species.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.400
Does it occur in other species?

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.050
And it turns out that it
is all over the place.

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.790
You find FOXP2 in
birds and mammals

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:03.990
and all sorts of
things, large and small.

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.560
It is very, very widespread.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.970
But, importantly, a
different version than you

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:11.330
find in humans.

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.450
It is immensely
conserved, which is

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:18.460
to say you see the
same version of FOXP2

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.340
ranging from apes to birds,
everything in between.

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.350
Nothing has changed
with that evolutionarily

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.555
in a long, long time.

00:05:27.555 --> 00:05:28.935
So what does it do?

00:05:28.935 --> 00:05:33.280
A handful of studies in animals
where the gene has been knocked

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.730
out, it has been removed,
where you now have

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:38.460
mice that do not have the gene.

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:42.250
And what you see is there
is less of vocalization

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:44.650
and simpler vocalization.

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:46.230
And that's back
to our whole world

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:50.240
of that subsonic
vocalizations that you

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.052
can't hear when
mice are giggling

00:05:52.052 --> 00:05:53.010
and that sort of thing.

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:56.490
Knock out this gene, and
there's less vocalizing

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:59.370
and there's less
complexity to it.

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:02.840
So we're just doing something
or other that looks plausible.

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.870
And it's expressed
in motoric parts

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:08.570
of the brain preferentially
in these other species.

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:10.740
So this super
conservative version

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.940
of this gene, everybody
else has the same version.

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.190
And then you look
at the human version

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:19.030
and there's a bunch
of differences

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:22.650
and they emerged very
recently, best estimates

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:25.580
are the last couple
of 100,000 years.

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.150
Each one of the
changes extremely

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:32.320
positively selected for,
whatever this gene is about,

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:35.150
once it sort of went
on the human path,

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:40.130
it changed real fast under
major selective advantageous

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:40.910
conditions.

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:43.310
And thus, we've got a
real different version

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:45.320
from everyone else.

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:47.380
The next interesting
thing about it,

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:51.280
in so far as it is a
transcription factor, when

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:54.770
you look at the genes that
it regulates-- so this is now

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:58.560
taking her step further, our
old genetic network deal,

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:01.560
when you look downstream,
what genes it regulates,

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:04.800
they tend to be
fairly differentiated

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.890
from other primates and
to have differentiated

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:10.360
as a result of
positive selection.

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:13.300
So this is a whole
cluster of genes

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:16.090
that evolution was doing
some pretty stringent things

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:20.900
on in hominids in the last
couple of 100,000 years.

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:24.920
Now, what you do is one of the
all-time cool studies, which

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:27.620
was last year,
which you take mice

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:30.980
and you knock out
their FOXP2 gene.

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:35.490
And now, you stick
in the human version.

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:40.410
And, amazingly, what happens
is once these animals mature,

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:44.414
they speak just
like Mickey Mouse.

00:07:44.414 --> 00:07:45.330
People were listening.

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:48.200
What you wind up seeing
is-- it's probably

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:50.210
the Disney people probably
are working on it,

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:51.793
and that's going to
be the end of life

00:07:51.793 --> 00:07:53.740
as we know it when they
let those ones lose.

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:56.870
What you get when you
overexpress-- when you express

00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:59.810
the human FOXP2 in
a mouse is a mouse

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:04.620
with more vocalizations
and more complex ones.

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:09.520
Whoa, that is mighty interesting
area of lots and lots of work

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:12.320
these days, trying to figure
out what this transcription

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:13.540
factor is about.

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:17.560
But, clearly, just
this screaming imprint

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:20.290
of major league selection
that has gone on

00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:23.120
for the human version
and for the genes

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:26.030
that it regulates,
fairly recently, it

00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:29.500
is no surprise that this
gene is central to such

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:32.650
a different unique
thing that we're doing.

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:35.434
More evidence for genetic
components of the language,

00:08:35.434 --> 00:08:37.919
and this one is a
very indirect one

00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:40.293
with this totally
interesting phenomenon that

00:08:40.293 --> 00:08:43.120
has been shown in lots and
lots of different places

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:44.950
on the globe.

00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:48.510
So you get some circumstance
where a whole bunch of people

00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:50.945
are brought together
from different cultures,

00:08:50.945 --> 00:08:53.840
with different language
groups, and why they're

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:55.940
having to deal with each other.

00:08:55.940 --> 00:09:01.630
Classic version is you get,
for example, slave populations

00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:03.680
brought from different
places in West Africa

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:05.600
to some of the
Caribbean islands.

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:08.450
You have, on some of
the Hawaiian Islands,

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:11.720
early in the last century,
people from all over Asia

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:15.220
are brought over to worth
the plantations there,

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:16.550
the fields, whatever.

00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:18.300
What you have in
these cases, there's

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:21.160
a whole bunch of people
thrown together who

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:23.700
have languages from
every which way

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:25.700
who don't understand each other.

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:27.480
And what always
emerges, what has

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:30.600
been extremely
well-documented, is some sort

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:34.660
of fragmentary
communication system that

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:37.950
is made up of bits and pieces
of all the relevant languages,

00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:41.260
which everybody can kind of
limp through and begin to be

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.110
understood with each other.

00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:46.946
And what that is wounds up being
called is a pidgin language.

00:09:46.946 --> 00:09:51.480
Pidgin, very simplistic version
that shows virtually nothing

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:55.350
in the way of complex
grammar, and it's basically

00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:57.490
a vehicle for
getting individuals

00:09:57.490 --> 00:09:59.380
who almost always,
in these cases,

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:03.450
are societally pretty under
the foot of powers that

00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:06.660
be to deal with each other,
to work with each other,

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:10.530
working out this proto
proto communication system

00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:13.670
with fragments of each language.

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:15.300
That's not surprising.

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:19.730
What is totally cool is what
happens next over the next one

00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:24.320
to two generations, which
is this pidgin thing,

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:27.960
this committee glued
together amalgamation

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:29.870
of fragments of
different languages

00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:32.680
within a generation
or two has evolved

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:35.050
into a real language,
which is then

00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:37.420
known as a creole language.

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:39.730
Creole languages
are languages that

00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:43.020
are a couple of generations
descended from pidgin.

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:47.800
And what you see is it winds
up being a real language.

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:51.450
That's fine, that's fine,
given that, two days ago, we're

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:53.220
hearing that it was
possible for kids

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:56.130
to come up and invent
Nicaragua in sign language

00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:58.170
within a generation.

00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:00.100
So you start with
this pidgin thing,

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:01.820
and within a couple
of generations,

00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:04.470
it turns into a real
language, fits the rules,

00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:05.710
grammar, all of that.

00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:08.470
Here is the thing
that is so interesting

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:13.330
about this phenomenon, which
is all of the creoles have

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:17.010
the same grammatical structure.

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:18.500
What is that about?

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:21.160
Creoles from all
over the planet that

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:23.850
were built upon all
sorts of differing

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:27.660
hodgepodge of the original
languages in the pidgin, Creole

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:33.170
languages all have a similar
grammatical structure.

00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:36.570
Easy explanation, easy
boring one, which is it's

00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:40.440
very simple grammatical
structures and this

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:42.050
is a language that's
just getting off

00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:43.490
its feet in each case.

00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:47.940
No, in all these cases it
is grammatical structures

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:50.200
that are not necessarily
the simplest.

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:53.050
It's not just some
baby step languages.

00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:56.030
It's languages that
all seem to come up

00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:58.280
with the same graphical
structures there.

00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:01.100
And what this has given
rise to is the notion

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:06.030
that there is a default
grammar built into humans.

00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:09.310
Let humans go running with
a whole bunch of fragments

00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:12.120
in different languages
and, not surprisingly, we

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:15.100
were able to turn it into
a real communicative system

00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:16.880
within a generation or two.

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:19.620
And when pulling
language out of thin air,

00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:23.140
humans always tend to
come up with the same sort

00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:26.010
of grammatical structures
that are not necessarily

00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:29.220
the simplest, argument there
being there is an innate,

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:34.270
there is a hard wire, there is
an ancient pattern of grammar

00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:36.710
that humans use when they
come up with a language.

00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:38.920
So totally interesting.

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:41.480
What you find, also,
with the sign languages,

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:44.820
as they get invented,
Nicaraguan sign language,

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:46.630
it went through a
first generation

00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:49.660
of being pidgin, and soon
turned into a signing

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:51.080
equivalent of creole.

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:54.300
And it has some of the same
grammatical structures.

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:58.370
Even when humans are defaulting
into a new language that's

00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:01.730
purely gestural, it shows
some of these constraints

00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:04.520
that you see with
the creole languages.

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:06.670
Other features of this
that come through,

00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:10.260
apparently, there's like
24 different ways that you

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:14.240
can put together objects,
and subjects, and rejects,

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:18.200
the participles, and whatever
it is, grammatical structures.

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:20.200
This guy, Joseph
Greenberg, linguist,

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:22.580
who was here at Stanford
until a few years ago when

00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:25.870
he died, apparently,
incredible titan in the field,

00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:27.210
he did some of this research.

00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:29.600
There's 24 possible
different ways

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:32.500
languages can do this
object subject business,

00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:36.540
and all across the earth,
all across the 6000 languages

00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:40.120
there, you only see
15 of them used.

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:43.420
And the vast majority
of grammars on earth

00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:45.600
only use four of them.

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:47.830
So the argument there
winds up being this

00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:50.450
is a pretty nonrandom skew.

00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:55.750
Again, we're seeing some kind
of prepared learning default

00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:59.260
grammars, this very
imprecise sense of there's

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.050
something genetic
floating around here.

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:04.590
So that complementary
to the whole world

00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:06.390
instead of looking
at things like FOXP2

00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:10.100
and this mutations, the usual
two very different approaches.

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:12.730
That whole pidgin
to creole transition

00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:17.870
is really, really interesting
and it really has this feel

00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:21.920
in the undercurrents of it that
there is a basic human grammar

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:24.040
that floats around
there, a notion

00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:27.400
that Chomsky has pushed
for a long, long time.

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:31.020
Jumping one box further
back, ecological factors

00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:32.280
and language.

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:35.120
I'm going to touch on that only
briefly, but what you've got

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:39.400
is something similar to a theme
we heard a couple of weeks ago,

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:43.030
which is possibly not something
we heard a couple weeks ago

00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:44.420
and we'll instead
hear on Friday.

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:48.940
But what you see is
diverse ecosystems,

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:51.950
very biodiverse ecosystems.

00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:54.790
Rain forest ones,
for example, produce

00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:58.545
cultures which have a great
deal of diversity in them.

00:14:58.545 --> 00:15:00.520
What we're going
to see on Friday,

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:02.500
the version of
that, which I'm now

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:06.380
thinking I did mention before,
is that polytheistic cultures

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:09.480
are the things you tend to
see coming out of rain forest

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:12.530
settings, that notion that if
there's hundreds, if there's

00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:15.700
a thousand different types of
edible plants in your world,

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:17.850
it doesn't take a great
leap to decide there's

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:21.530
a whole lot of different spurred
things in the world going

00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:22.120
on there.

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:25.460
Polytheism, a very
similar theme,

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:28.790
great work done a few years ago,
a guy named William Sutherland

00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:31.700
from the University of Dundee,
I think, where what he showed

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:34.850
was looking all over
the planet, looking

00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:37.480
at the biodiversity
in different regions

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:41.170
on the planet, the more
ecological diversity,

00:15:41.170 --> 00:15:44.740
the more linguistic diversity
you would find in that region.

00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:47.190
The more different
languages, which, of course,

00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:50.760
thus translates down into
small groups, small numbers

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:53.880
of speakers, this is an
interesting phenomenon,

00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:56.490
which it's not completely clear
to me what to make of that.

00:15:56.490 --> 00:15:59.400
But ecosystems that
are very diverse

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:04.140
generate an abundance
of theistic notions

00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:07.970
and at above expected
rates and also produces

00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:11.190
a whole lot more languages,
something on the diversity

00:16:11.190 --> 00:16:12.070
there.

00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:14.850
What his work then showed
is about everything else

00:16:14.850 --> 00:16:17.290
I'm going to say in
this area, which is just

00:16:17.290 --> 00:16:22.250
totally depressing stuff, which
is linguistic diversity is

00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:25.480
going down the tubes
faster than biodiversity.

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:28.270
He shows that the rate
of language extinction

00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:32.510
proportionately is faster
than the rate of extinction

00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:35.210
of various species, plants, etc.

00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:38.870
In these rain forest
ecosystems, totally grim,

00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:40.610
depressing picture.

00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:43.730
What seems to be the case,
given where things are heading,

00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:46.630
is in the next century,
in this century,

00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:50.300
90% of Earth's languages
will go extinct.

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:53.090
The vast majority of
humans on this planet

00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:55.230
speak less than 10
different languages

00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:57.500
out of the 6,000 existing ones.

00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:58.850
How's this for depressing?

00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:02.190
There's a couple of hundred
different languages that

00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:07.859
are Inuit, and Northwest
Native American,

00:17:07.859 --> 00:17:11.000
and some other
population as well.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.980
And currently, only of
5% of those languages

00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:18.230
have speakers who
are not elderly.

00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:19.810
That's real depressing.

00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:23.250
Also, and something that
strikes me as extraordinary

00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:26.359
is, in each one of those
cases, somewhere along the way,

00:17:26.359 --> 00:17:28.890
there's going to be
somebody in old age

00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:32.330
who's the last person on earth
who understands their language.

00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:34.910
There's not a single
other person alive

00:17:34.910 --> 00:17:37.840
who will be able to talk in
their mother tongue with them.

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:40.560
Language is disappearing
left and right,

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:43.390
along with, of course,
cultural diversity

00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:45.650
going down the
tubes, the process

00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:47.540
of turning the whole
world into a lowest

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:50.340
common denominator of
McDonald's culture, blah, blah.

00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:53.530
Along with that comes
a huge, huge loss

00:17:53.530 --> 00:17:55.620
of language diversity.

00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:58.300
Finally, jumping
to our last box,

00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:00.460
if we're talking about
ecological factors,

00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:02.310
thinking about
things like genes,

00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:04.560
thinking about things
like highly, highly

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:08.060
driven positive selection
for genes like FOXP2

00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:11.450
in humans, of course, we have to
talk about the evolutionary end

00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:12.590
of things.

00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:16.260
So evolution of language
and humans, general notion

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:21.160
is click languages, which you
tend to see in hunter gatherers

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:23.970
in Africa, that that might
have been the earliest

00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:26.990
forms, the most ancient
types of languages on Earth.

00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:31.570
And what you also see is
hunter gatherers are probably

00:18:31.570 --> 00:18:34.340
the most ancient sort of
populations of humans that

00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:38.190
live in Africa, with waves
of agriculturalists coming

00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:41.020
from North Africa, the
Middle East, at later points,

00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:43.940
pastoralists coming from
around there as well.

00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:47.740
The original populations in
Africa were hunter gatherers.

00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:51.370
And they have high frequencies
of these click languages.

00:18:51.370 --> 00:18:54.760
That might be the starting
point for human language.

00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:57.750
Interestingly, though, you
also see click languages

00:18:57.750 --> 00:19:01.090
among a lot of aboriginal
groups in Australia.

00:19:01.090 --> 00:19:02.730
What does that tell you?

00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:04.590
Those became separately.

00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:07.990
There was a huge gulf
of time between leaving

00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:11.750
Africa and the first populations
winding up in Australia,

00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:13.580
convergent evolution.

00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:18.200
For some reason, click languages
is a very fundamental way

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:21.510
that people come up with
communication systems.

00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:24.970
So selection issues
often run in with

00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:29.260
our social biological notions
of language advantages,

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:31.760
it's easy to see what
the advantages are

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:33.390
of having a language system.

00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:37.590
It is easier to store,
to archive, knowledge,

00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:38.450
information.

00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:41.240
It is easier to
coordinate hunts.

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:45.490
It is easier to figure out
what we did the last time there

00:19:45.490 --> 00:19:48.860
was a famine, figuring out
things like that, all of those

00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:50.600
facilitated by language.

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:54.070
In the memorable words of
Steve Pinker from Harvard,

00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:56.900
"Language is how we
outsmart plants."

00:19:56.900 --> 00:20:01.820
Language allows us to do all
sorts of organizational stuff.

00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:05.010
Language evolution is
all about sequence.

00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:07.810
We don't say a words
simultaneously.

00:20:07.810 --> 00:20:08.980
It's all sequences.

00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:10.980
And a number of
people have emphasized

00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:14.760
that's what the construction
of tools are about also.

00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:20.170
The whole process of careful
logical sequential transitions

00:20:20.170 --> 00:20:24.130
of steps almost certainly
tool use and language use

00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:28.120
is sequential processes
emerging in parallel.

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:33.130
Finally, obviously, you see all
sorts of room for cooperation

00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:37.270
with kin selection, cooperation
with reciprocal altruism being

00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:38.970
enhanced with communication.

00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:42.380
But very importantly, for
our game theory world,

00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:44.770
what language also
allows you to do

00:20:44.770 --> 00:20:48.590
is lie, that whole
business from two days ago.

00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:51.980
In human language, there's
that arbitrariness.

00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:55.690
There's a dissociation between
the message and the messenger.

00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:57.560
It's not like dogs
that have to put

00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:00.560
the lid on their fear pheromones
by tucking their tale.

00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:03.590
What you have is
the capacity to lie.

00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:06.540
And, of course, running off
from that, a whole world

00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:09.350
of evolutionary strategizing.

00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:13.730
Pertinent to that, there's a
huge, huge disproportionate

00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:17.420
share of neurons in the
motor system devoted

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:20.930
to facial expressions,
and mouth coordination,

00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:22.890
and all that kind of world.

00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:25.630
A really good thing
if you plan to lie

00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:28.020
is to be able to
have good control

00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:30.220
over your facial expressions.

00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:33.070
Finally, formal
game theory models

00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:35.870
showing when you have pairs
of individuals playing

00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:38.470
against each other,
when you introduce,

00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:41.880
when you allow the
emergence of communication

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:44.160
between two of the
players versus not

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:47.900
in the other group, you
immediately, no surprise,

00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:49.640
have been getting
a big advantage.

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:53.150
If you allow them
semanticity, to have words

00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:56.310
that they can communicate,
that is advantageous,

00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:58.000
that improves outcome.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.630
Even better is if you allow
semanticity and structure,

00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:05.380
syntax, grammar, so
that they can have

00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:07.490
more complex communication.

00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:09.230
All of those wind
up being things

00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:13.390
that facilitate winning
in game theory settings.

00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:15.680
Finally, interesting
parallelism,

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:18.460
back to that
biodiversity stuff, which

00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:21.320
is, when you look at all those
different possible grammatical

00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:24.510
structures, the 24
of them, 15 of which

00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:26.690
is the total of what
appears on Earth,

00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:30.370
the rarest of the
grammatical structures

00:22:30.370 --> 00:22:34.940
are the ones that are
closest to extinction.

00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:37.510
The rarest not in terms
of the number of people

00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:40.530
speaking it within a
population, but the structures

00:22:40.530 --> 00:22:44.010
that have occurred the fewest
number of times in cultures

00:22:44.010 --> 00:22:46.290
across the planet
are the ones that

00:22:46.290 --> 00:22:48.450
are in cultures where
the languages are

00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:52.570
most readily to be a lost,
some sort of connection there.

00:22:52.570 --> 00:22:54.736
And thus, you've
got some sort of

00:22:54.736 --> 00:22:57.390
weird grammatical
imperialism that

00:22:57.390 --> 00:22:59.130
has emerged over the years.

00:22:59.130 --> 00:23:02.770
Again, what strikes me as a
totally depressing number,

00:23:02.770 --> 00:23:08.280
90% of Earth's languages will
disappear in the next century.

00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:09.830
So now we jump.

00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:11.810
We jump to our next
topic, which was

00:23:11.810 --> 00:23:14.170
our first psychiatric disease.

00:23:14.170 --> 00:23:16.850
And to remind you
from two days ago,

00:23:16.850 --> 00:23:18.780
we're not going to have
a depression lecture.

00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:21.280
The depression chapter
in the zebra's book

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:26.260
will tell all the same stuff in
much better, more clear terms,

00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:27.800
I say, proving my point.

00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:31.400
And what you should do is
read it with as much attention

00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:33.690
to it as if it has
been a lecture subject.

00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:37.200
It is an important
subject, enough hints.

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:38.240
So check that one out.

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:41.640
What we focus on today
though is schizophrenia.

00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:44.400
And we're going to take
our same old strategy,

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:47.360
starting off with what
is the disease look like.

00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:50.270
And as you will see, all
sorts of surprises in there,

00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:52.520
and then what goes
on in the brain

00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:56.700
just before early development,
prenatal, genes, evolution,

00:23:56.700 --> 00:23:57.762
the whole deal there.

00:23:57.762 --> 00:23:59.935
We know this drill once again.

00:23:59.935 --> 00:24:03.010
So starting off, making
sense of schizophrenia,

00:24:03.010 --> 00:24:04.720
as a bunch of
behaviorists, you've

00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:07.270
got a challenge right
off the bat, which

00:24:07.270 --> 00:24:11.290
is lots of people use the word
schizophrenic in an every day

00:24:11.290 --> 00:24:13.990
sense that has no
resemblance whatsoever

00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:15.760
to its actual technical use.

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:18.940
Schizophrenic, or schizian--
we all know that one.

00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:22.660
We've thought, my God, I am
having such a schizi day.

00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:25.910
I overslept, I missed my
first class, it was terrible.

00:24:25.910 --> 00:24:27.790
I totally screwed up,
but then I found out

00:24:27.790 --> 00:24:29.474
I got this great
grade on a midterm,

00:24:29.474 --> 00:24:31.140
but then I had this
fight with a friend,

00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:33.181
but then in the afternoon,
and then this crashed,

00:24:33.181 --> 00:24:34.000
and, blah, blah.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.190
God, what a schizoid
day I'm having.

00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:40.430
No resemblance to how
the term's actually used.

00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:43.570
That's not any sort of
real term in psychiatry.

00:24:43.570 --> 00:24:46.440
Whatever the schizi
days are that we all

00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:48.630
experience now and
then, schizophrenia

00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:50.030
is something else.

00:24:50.030 --> 00:24:53.020
On the most technical
level, schizophrenia

00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:57.020
is a disease of people where,
when you start talking to them,

00:24:57.020 --> 00:24:58.880
within two or three
sentences, you

00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:02.090
realize there's something
strange with their thinking.

00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:04.360
They're not thinking normally.

00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:06.540
They're not
communicating normally.

00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:10.740
On the most fundamental level,
that's what the disease is.

00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:14.830
Obviously, far more precise
than that, schizophrenia,

00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:17.200
disease of thought
disorder, disease

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:19.730
of inappropriate
emotion, disease

00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:23.170
of inappropriate attribution
of things, and what you'll see

00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:28.020
is this is not just some sort
of generic craziness in the way

00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:30.180
that that word means
nothing whatsoever.

00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:33.950
There are typical structures
to the ways in which things

00:25:33.950 --> 00:25:36.910
are not working right in the
behavior of schizophrenics,

00:25:36.910 --> 00:25:39.200
which we'll hear about in a bit.

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:41.050
Part of what begins
to bring that across

00:25:41.050 --> 00:25:43.900
is the obvious fact
that there's no way

00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:46.640
that schizophrenia
is just one disease,

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:48.980
because there's all
sorts of subtypes.

00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:51.730
It is a bunch of
heterogeneous diseases.

00:25:51.730 --> 00:25:55.030
You have a subtype
paranoid schizophrenia,

00:25:55.030 --> 00:25:58.630
where what it's all about
is thought disorder built

00:25:58.630 --> 00:26:00.572
around a sense of persecution.

00:26:00.572 --> 00:26:03.220
You have catatonic
schizophrenia,

00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:05.550
where the person is
in a frozen state,

00:26:05.550 --> 00:26:07.990
immobile for long
periods of time.

00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:10.630
You have schizoaffective
disorders,

00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:13.620
which is kind of a mixture of
schizophrenia and depression

00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:14.510
disorders.

00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:16.040
It's not just one disease.

00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:19.200
So the whole array of
behavioral symptoms

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:21.500
we're going to look at
now, remember, some of them

00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:23.920
are more common in different
subtypes than others.

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:26.880
This is just the
first broad overpass.

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:29.280
So beginning to make
sense of the disease, what

00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:32.080
it is, above all
else, is a disease

00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:37.400
of cognitive abnormalities, of
abnormal sequential thought.

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:41.890
And the term that's given
for it is loose associations.

00:26:41.890 --> 00:26:45.990
All of us can tell a story where
we have a pretty good ability

00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:49.330
to put it sequentially and
have the facts go in a way

00:26:49.330 --> 00:26:52.080
where it will make sense
to any other listener.

00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:55.900
You do not see this
in schizophrenics.

00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:59.060
Sequential thinking
is greatly impaired.

00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:03.030
And instead of having logical
sequences of information

00:27:03.030 --> 00:27:06.920
that they give, things
tangent all over the place,

00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:10.720
bouncing around all over,
where, in retrospect, you

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:13.040
can kind of see how
they might have gotten

00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:16.050
from A to Z, although most
people would have gone

00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:19.660
from A to B at that point,
the tangential thinking

00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:24.070
being another term for it,
the loose associations.

00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:26.430
So what do you wind
up seeing there?

00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:29.120
You get schizophrenics,
for example,

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:31.690
who get terribly
confused in a sentence,

00:27:31.690 --> 00:27:34.280
whether when they are
hearing about boxers,

00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:37.650
they are unable to keep
straight within one sentence

00:27:37.650 --> 00:27:40.590
to separate out whether
they're talking about a dog

00:27:40.590 --> 00:27:43.150
or they're talking
about an occupation.

00:27:43.150 --> 00:27:46.540
Because they slip back
and forth between the two.

00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:50.200
Confusion between
being a caddy, a caddy,

00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:55.830
someone who a golf whatever,
and a Cadillac, short term

00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:56.780
for that.

00:27:56.780 --> 00:27:59.960
All sorts of ways in
which they can't hold on

00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:01.510
to the sequential logic.

00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:04.190
And, instead, there's
just this tangenting,

00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:07.330
getting caught up in
the loose associations.

00:28:07.330 --> 00:28:10.100
You're talking about a boxer,
if you were a schizophrenic,

00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:11.920
you were talking about
a particular boxer,

00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:14.970
you follow that sport
whatever, and, suddenly,

00:28:14.970 --> 00:28:16.680
you are expressing
an opinion about how

00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:20.600
that person would do in a
ring against a St. Bernard.

00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:22.590
And you're often
talking about dogs

00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:26.500
from there, just getting
caught by a loose association

00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:29.590
between the sound of the word
and its multiple meanings,

00:28:29.590 --> 00:28:33.930
going off the tracks on that,
so the loose associations.

00:28:33.930 --> 00:28:36.730
Next, you have a
trouble, consistent one,

00:28:36.730 --> 00:28:38.720
with abstraction.

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:41.370
All of us have a pretty
good intuitive sense,

00:28:41.370 --> 00:28:43.220
when someone is
telling us a story,

00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:47.290
is this meant to be
literal reporting of events

00:28:47.290 --> 00:28:51.070
in a sequential way, is
this meant to be a parable,

00:28:51.070 --> 00:28:54.420
is this meant to be a
somewhat secondhand,

00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:56.120
through the grapevine story.

00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:59.680
We have a very good
sense of how concrete

00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:03.110
or how abstract the information
that we're getting is.

00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:06.040
Schizophrenics are
terrible at that.

00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:10.830
They have no intuition to get
the right level of abstraction.

00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:14.230
And schizophrenics always
skew in the same direction,

00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:18.200
which is to interpret
things far more concretely

00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:19.800
than is actually the case.

00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:23.100
And that's the term that's used
in the business, concreteness

00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:27.690
of thought, which is having a
lot of trouble doing the more

00:29:27.690 --> 00:29:29.990
abstract process
of seeing things

00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:33.580
on a metaphorical level,
things of that sort.

00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:35.290
So here, here's the
standard sort of test

00:29:35.290 --> 00:29:37.831
you would give to someone if
you think they're schizophrenic.

00:29:37.831 --> 00:29:39.530
You give them an
association task.

00:29:39.530 --> 00:29:41.390
And you say something
like, OK, can you

00:29:41.390 --> 00:29:42.930
tell me what do
these things have

00:29:42.930 --> 00:29:47.050
in common, an apple, an
orange, and a banana.

00:29:47.050 --> 00:29:52.020
And they'll say all of them
are multi-syllabic words.

00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:54.020
You'll say, OK, well,
that's great, that's true.

00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:56.550
But anything else
they have in common?

00:29:56.550 --> 00:30:00.020
All of them have letters that
involved closed loops, just

00:30:00.020 --> 00:30:03.640
getting caught up in the
most concrete possible level

00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:07.900
of interpretations of it,
not able to step back and do

00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:09.920
any sort of abstracting.

00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:12.520
You see this in all
sorts of other ways.

00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:16.580
Therapist role, meet the patient
and say something like so

00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:18.560
what's on your mind
today, and they'll

00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:22.990
say my hair in this very
literal sort of way.

00:30:22.990 --> 00:30:26.400
Or you'll say can I take your
picture, holding a camera,

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:29.230
and they'll say, I don't
have a picture to give you,

00:30:29.230 --> 00:30:31.440
this very literal sense again.

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:34.190
Or things like you would
sit down a schizophrenic

00:30:34.190 --> 00:30:36.660
with a piece of paper
and a pen and say, just

00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:38.270
as part of what
we're doing here,

00:30:38.270 --> 00:30:43.405
can you write a sentence
for me, any sentence.

00:30:43.405 --> 00:30:44.780
And then you look
at what they've

00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:48.564
written which is a sentence
for me, any sentence.

00:30:48.564 --> 00:30:50.480
And then you say, no,
no, no, actually, that's

00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:51.320
not what I mean.

00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:53.620
I mean can you come
up with a sentence.

00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:56.660
And when you've thought of
that sentence, write it.

00:30:56.660 --> 00:30:59.860
And they'll write the word
it because they can't get out

00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:04.320
of the concreteness of saying
could you write a sentence, can

00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:07.360
you write colon a sentence.

00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:10.920
They're caught up in the
concrete level of that.

00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:12.940
A way that that
always pops up, one

00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:15.560
of the classic types
of tests that's done,

00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:17.780
is called proverb tests.

00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:21.290
Proverbs, by definition,
they are metaphorical.

00:31:21.290 --> 00:31:23.470
They are parables,
they are abstract.

00:31:23.470 --> 00:31:26.130
And we all know
intuitively that when

00:31:26.130 --> 00:31:28.850
you're talking about birds
of a feather flock together,

00:31:28.850 --> 00:31:33.210
you're doing something symbolic
about the well-known homogamy

00:31:33.210 --> 00:31:37.760
of lips with people who
they choose to marry

00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:38.796
and the similarities.

00:31:38.796 --> 00:31:40.420
Yes, birds of a
feather flock together,

00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:43.430
it's talking about like
tend to assort with like.

00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:46.310
Give proverbs to
schizophrenics and they

00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:49.170
can't get out of the
most concrete level

00:31:49.170 --> 00:31:50.630
of interpretation of it.

00:31:50.630 --> 00:31:52.700
So you're sitting down
and you say, OK, tell me

00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:53.810
what this means.

00:31:53.810 --> 00:31:56.350
A rolling stone gathers no moss.

00:31:56.350 --> 00:31:59.200
And we all know that that's
people are on the move,

00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:00.870
don't make an
emotional connections,

00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:02.250
there is a detachment.

00:32:02.250 --> 00:32:09.590
And they're often saying stones,
stones rolling down hills,

00:32:09.590 --> 00:32:12.150
it's very hard for
plants to grow on them.

00:32:12.150 --> 00:32:15.420
It's very hard because the
surface tends to be smooth.

00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:17.340
And then on top of
it, if it's rolling,

00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:20.080
you've got like this angular
motion that move to it.

00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:23.210
So it's very hard for
moss to grow on stones.

00:32:23.210 --> 00:32:25.640
In fact, I don't think
I've ever seen that happen.

00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:27.130
And I've seen many stones.

00:32:27.130 --> 00:32:30.390
And on the most
concrete possible level,

00:32:30.390 --> 00:32:34.520
incapable of pulling it back
to the level of abstraction.

00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:37.400
Consistent, consistent
feature of this.

00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:39.450
Here, friend of mine
who's a psychiatrist

00:32:39.450 --> 00:32:43.120
came up with what has to be one
of the all-time great proverb

00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:44.910
tests for figuring
out if someone

00:32:44.910 --> 00:32:47.630
has the remotest tendency
towards schizophrenic

00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:48.810
concreteness.

00:32:48.810 --> 00:32:53.260
There was a abstract
phrase, a proverb,

00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:56.740
that was very popular, that was
very prevalent in the United

00:32:56.740 --> 00:32:58.520
States during World War II.

00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:03.250
It was up on posters and all the
post offices, places like that.

00:33:03.250 --> 00:33:07.840
And it was a way of abstractly
telling people be careful

00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:11.000
the information you put in
letters that you are sending

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.300
off to loved ones
who are off at war

00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:16.420
because it may inadvertently
wind up in the wrong hands

00:33:16.420 --> 00:33:19.830
and could carry information
that could be extremely damaging

00:33:19.830 --> 00:33:21.320
to the war effort.

00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:23.420
Do people know what it is?

00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:26.380
Loose lips sink ships,
loose lips sink ships,

00:33:26.380 --> 00:33:28.240
wonderfully abstract notion.

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:31.080
Try sitting down a
schizophrenic and saying

00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:35.980
what does it mean when you
say loose lips sink ships.

00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:38.010
And, suddenly,
there's this imagery

00:33:38.010 --> 00:33:41.150
of ships being capsized
by big lips coming out

00:33:41.150 --> 00:33:43.110
of the water and
things of that sort

00:33:43.110 --> 00:33:45.780
because it can only be
dealt with on the very

00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:47.860
concrete level.

00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:48.820
What else?

00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:53.510
More symptomatology, delusions,
belief in things that cannot

00:33:53.510 --> 00:33:56.700
be, belief in having
participated in historical

00:33:56.700 --> 00:33:58.560
events that cannot be.

00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:01.330
You're sitting there
interviewing a schizophrenic

00:34:01.330 --> 00:34:03.020
and they suddenly
say have you heard

00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:04.590
of the Great Wall of China.

00:34:04.590 --> 00:34:07.010
And you will say, well,
yes, in fact, I have.

00:34:07.010 --> 00:34:11.239
And they'll say
my idea, my idea.

00:34:11.239 --> 00:34:13.219
The generals came to
me at night with a map

00:34:13.219 --> 00:34:15.550
and I said this
is where it goes.

00:34:15.550 --> 00:34:17.219
This is probably
not what happened.

00:34:17.219 --> 00:34:19.639
Delusional thought,
inserting yourself,

00:34:19.639 --> 00:34:22.630
conversations with people
who no longer exist.

00:34:22.630 --> 00:34:25.659
Related to that is
the paranoia, which,

00:34:25.659 --> 00:34:29.350
of course, is most florid
in paranoid schizophrenia,

00:34:29.350 --> 00:34:30.620
but it is a frequent theme.

00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:34.110
What do apples, oranges,
and bananas have in common?

00:34:34.110 --> 00:34:36.750
They're all wired for sound.

00:34:36.750 --> 00:34:39.040
If the fruit is
listening to you,

00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:41.770
this makes for a rather
disquieting life.

00:34:41.770 --> 00:34:43.440
And almost certainly,
it has something

00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:47.290
to do with if the world is
making so little sense to you,

00:34:47.290 --> 00:34:50.710
it is a world that
is very threatening.

00:34:50.710 --> 00:34:53.770
Along with that, most
famously, perhaps,

00:34:53.770 --> 00:34:58.180
with schizophrenia, is
you get hallucinations.

00:34:58.180 --> 00:35:00.780
Those are the defining features.

00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:03.610
Somebody is trying to figure
out if somebody in an emergency

00:35:03.610 --> 00:35:07.400
room has come in with some sort
of schizophrenic type disorder

00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:10.480
and hear that the
person is hearing voices

00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:14.880
and that pretty much
nails down the diagnosis.

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:18.070
For reasons that are
very poorly understood,

00:35:18.070 --> 00:35:22.780
the vast majority of
hallucinations are auditory.

00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:25.240
However, there's all sorts
of notions with that.

00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:29.060
And one great theory coming from
our own Patrick House, given

00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:32.610
two years ago, which is you get
auditory hallucinations more

00:35:32.610 --> 00:35:34.640
often than visual
ones because we're

00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:37.330
more accustomed to
visual stuff in the world

00:35:37.330 --> 00:35:41.120
having fragmented visions or
seeing it across two mirrors,

00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:42.910
reflections, things
of that sort.

00:35:42.910 --> 00:35:46.820
We are more vulnerable towards
sounds not making sense.

00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:49.610
Vast majority of
hallucinations in schizophrenia

00:35:49.610 --> 00:35:51.880
are auditory hallucinations.

00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:54.780
When we see in a little while
what the neurochemistry is

00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:58.390
of hallucinations, by all
logic, what they should be

00:35:58.390 --> 00:36:03.910
is just random splatters of
noise, and random visual dots,

00:36:03.910 --> 00:36:04.880
and all of that.

00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:07.070
Instead, they're structured.

00:36:07.070 --> 00:36:08.630
They have content.

00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:12.440
People hear voices,
rather than random sound.

00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:15.490
People see very
structured hallucinations,

00:36:15.490 --> 00:36:19.290
sufficiently so that
researchers can even do studies

00:36:19.290 --> 00:36:22.590
as to which are the most common
voices heard by schizophrenics.

00:36:22.590 --> 00:36:25.320
And, no surprise,
in Western cultures,

00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:28.410
forever and ever, the number
one voice on the hit parade

00:36:28.410 --> 00:36:32.660
is that of Jesus, the number two
voice, Satan, the number three,

00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:34.580
typically, whoever
is the head of state

00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:36.210
in the country at that point.

00:36:36.210 --> 00:36:40.260
It's structure to that extent
that you can publish papers

00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:42.800
about what the
hallucinations are like.

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:46.540
There's all sorts of
structure underneath.

00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:49.120
It is not just
disordered thought,

00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:52.620
it's loose associations,
and tangenting,

00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:56.750
and concreteness, and
structured hallucinations.

00:36:56.750 --> 00:36:58.140
What else?

00:36:58.140 --> 00:37:02.020
Another feature of the
schizophrenic symptoms

00:37:02.020 --> 00:37:04.630
is social withdrawal.

00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:06.960
And schizophrenia,
everybody thinks

00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:09.480
of as a disease of
abnormal thought,

00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:13.170
it is a disease of abnormal
social affiliation.

00:37:13.170 --> 00:37:15.770
You look at a-- you
look at a schizophrenic

00:37:15.770 --> 00:37:19.480
in some village in who
knows where in the Amazon,

00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:24.030
or in Bloomington, Indiana, and
this is going to be someone who

00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:27.980
is somewhat ostracized and
socially disconnected, very

00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:28.720
much alone.

00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:32.930
It is not just the disease
of disordered thought.

00:37:32.930 --> 00:37:35.010
More and more
people are realizing

00:37:35.010 --> 00:37:38.970
the core with schizophrenia
is the disordered thought.

00:37:38.970 --> 00:37:40.950
The standard view
has always been

00:37:40.950 --> 00:37:44.170
to hone in on the most florid
feature of the disease.

00:37:44.170 --> 00:37:46.870
Schizophrenia is the disease
where you hallucinate,

00:37:46.870 --> 00:37:48.560
where you hear voices.

00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:53.060
And the vast majority of the
neuropharmacology research

00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:54.880
that's been done out
there on the disease

00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:58.220
is meant to go and cure
the hallucinations.

00:37:58.220 --> 00:38:01.750
But far less responsive
to any of the drugs

00:38:01.750 --> 00:38:04.800
are the tangenting
thought, the concreteness,

00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:06.280
the loose associations.

00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:07.910
More and more
people are thinking

00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:12.680
that that's really at the core
of what the disease is about.

00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:15.260
Couple more features
of it, which

00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:19.610
is the whole world of
the social withdrawal.

00:38:19.610 --> 00:38:21.310
Apathy, what we're
beginning to see

00:38:21.310 --> 00:38:24.720
is a dichotomy in the
business, positive symptoms

00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:28.920
in schizophrenia, paranoia,
loose thoughts hallucination,

00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:29.800
all of that.

00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:32.400
Negative symptoms
of schizophrenia,

00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:35.040
the absence of
social connectedness,

00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:40.460
the absence of affect, a
very flat expressive style.

00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:44.270
Physiologically,
you see some damping

00:38:44.270 --> 00:38:48.010
of autonomic nervous systems in
schizophrenics, so the positive

00:38:48.010 --> 00:38:51.160
and the negative
symptoms of the disease.

00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:55.850
Last a couple of features
of it, one is the notion

00:38:55.850 --> 00:38:57.360
that, of course,
schizophrenia has

00:38:57.360 --> 00:38:59.210
something to do with violence.

00:38:59.210 --> 00:39:03.640
Everybody knows that there is
the scenario lurking out there

00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:05.970
that occurs endless
number of times which

00:39:05.970 --> 00:39:10.350
is you have some psychiatrically
unstable individual turning out

00:39:10.350 --> 00:39:12.680
to have schizophrenia who
winds up doing something

00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:17.140
horribly violent, the danger
of schizophrenics cracking

00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:18.360
and going postal.

00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:21.000
And every now and then,
something like that happens.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.340
20 years ago, there was
a horrifying incident

00:39:23.340 --> 00:39:24.370
at Berkeley.

00:39:24.370 --> 00:39:28.400
A student there who was
schizophrenic and probably

00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:30.850
should not have been there at
the point because he was not

00:39:30.850 --> 00:39:33.570
well-medicated,
something cracked and he

00:39:33.570 --> 00:39:35.660
took a bunch of
Berkeley students,

00:39:35.660 --> 00:39:38.120
women, hostage in
a bar at Berkeley,

00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:42.430
did all sorts of horrific
sexually abusive things there

00:39:42.430 --> 00:39:46.370
before he killed himself
after killing a few of them.

00:39:46.370 --> 00:39:48.860
This is what happens
when something like that

00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:50.590
occurs with a schizophrenic.

00:39:50.590 --> 00:39:52.980
Oh, my God, so we've
got all these people

00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:56.260
running around where that
could be happening any second.

00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:59.760
Schizophrenics are
far less dangerous

00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:02.800
than are normal
individuals in society.

00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:06.830
The rates of violence
are extremely low,

00:40:06.830 --> 00:40:10.310
with one exception,
which is schizophrenics

00:40:10.310 --> 00:40:13.490
being violent and
damaging themselves.

00:40:13.490 --> 00:40:17.020
Self-injury, a huge
feature of schizophrenia,

00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:20.010
part of the delusions, part
of the thought disorder,

00:40:20.010 --> 00:40:23.010
part of the despair, when
every now and then your head

00:40:23.010 --> 00:40:25.600
clears enough to see what
the rest of it is like.

00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:28.500
And there are even
studies as to which

00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:32.050
are the most popular places
in the body that are mutilated

00:40:32.050 --> 00:40:33.210
in schizophrenics.

00:40:33.210 --> 00:40:37.180
Genitals are top on the list,
and going down from there.

00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:40.650
Horrific thing that happened,
also about 20 years ago,

00:40:40.650 --> 00:40:42.900
Columbia Medical
School, and this

00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:44.680
was an individual,
a student there,

00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:47.450
with a history of a lot of
psychiatric instability,

00:40:47.450 --> 00:40:51.080
and schizophrenia, and somewhat
well-controlled with meds.

00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:52.850
And somewhere in
the third year when

00:40:52.850 --> 00:40:56.680
starting the clinical rotations,
the various stressors of it,

00:40:56.680 --> 00:40:58.199
the person kind of unravelled.

00:40:58.199 --> 00:41:00.490
Probably should not have been
there in the first place,

00:41:00.490 --> 00:41:02.770
but, nonetheless, had
a schizophrenic break

00:41:02.770 --> 00:41:06.360
and had withdrawn from med
school and was sitting at home.

00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:08.970
Part of his paranoia,
part of his delusions

00:41:08.970 --> 00:41:11.880
were that he was
satanically possessed.

00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:15.440
And, specifically, the way
Satan was driving him to madness

00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:19.010
was with obsessive
sexual thoughts.

00:41:19.010 --> 00:41:22.400
So being a relatively
well-trained endocrinologist,

00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:25.050
because we know better than
him at this point how it works,

00:41:25.050 --> 00:41:27.890
he decides how do I make
those thoughts go away,

00:41:27.890 --> 00:41:30.190
let me get rid of
my testosterone.

00:41:30.190 --> 00:41:32.800
So he castrated himself.

00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:36.150
But at least being well-trained
in one domain of endocrinology,

00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:37.750
he knew that other
fact we've had

00:41:37.750 --> 00:41:40.860
in here which is that
the adrenal glands also

00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:43.230
make a certain degree
of testosterone.

00:41:43.230 --> 00:41:46.680
And he proceeded to try to
adrenalectomize himself.

00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:49.410
He sterilized with some alcohol.

00:41:49.410 --> 00:41:52.420
He made an incision
with anesthetic.

00:41:52.420 --> 00:41:54.350
He had a mirror
there, angled to be

00:41:54.350 --> 00:41:55.730
able to see what he was doing.

00:41:55.730 --> 00:41:58.820
And at one point, he hit a blood
vessel, which started bleeding.

00:41:58.820 --> 00:42:02.030
And he went to the ER at
Columbia Presbyterian,

00:42:02.030 --> 00:42:06.450
going in there, not saying
to his former classmates,

00:42:06.450 --> 00:42:10.070
oh, my God, guys, can you
help me, look what I've done.

00:42:10.070 --> 00:42:13.557
Saying instead, hi, guys, I'm
trying to take out my adrenals

00:42:13.557 --> 00:42:15.140
and I'm having a
problem here with it,

00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:16.840
can you give me a hand.

00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:19.420
This is very disordered thought.

00:42:19.420 --> 00:42:21.750
This is a very
elegant version of it

00:42:21.750 --> 00:42:26.230
schizophrenic self-injury,
schizophrenic suicide,

00:42:26.230 --> 00:42:28.490
is anything but clean.

00:42:28.490 --> 00:42:30.930
Number one on the list,
genitals, number two

00:42:30.930 --> 00:42:33.680
for women, female
schizophrenics, breasts, number

00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:36.320
three, thighs, on it goes.

00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:39.630
This brings up another
feature of the disease, which

00:42:39.630 --> 00:42:43.620
is, back in the 1960s, when
all sorts of laudable things

00:42:43.620 --> 00:42:46.130
happened along certain
cultural lines,

00:42:46.130 --> 00:42:49.210
there amid that was
one horrifically

00:42:49.210 --> 00:42:51.810
damaging idiotic
thing that emerged

00:42:51.810 --> 00:42:58.070
in psychiatry at the
time, which was a minority

00:42:58.070 --> 00:43:01.320
view in psychiatry, a
lunatic fringe view,

00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:06.970
that, basically,
schizophrenia is not so bad.

00:43:06.970 --> 00:43:11.260
Schizophrenia has all
sorts of hidden blessings.

00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:13.990
And soon, it had
frameworks of things

00:43:13.990 --> 00:43:16.890
like schizophrenia is
the disease of being

00:43:16.890 --> 00:43:18.980
healthy in a crazy world.

00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:22.600
Schizophrenia is the disease of
having insights into life that

00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:23.924
other people can't.

00:43:23.924 --> 00:43:25.715
And psychiatrists at
the time, one of them,

00:43:25.715 --> 00:43:28.310
a man named Ronald
Laing, who became famous

00:43:28.310 --> 00:43:31.160
for this, for arguing
it's not a disease,

00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:34.440
we shouldn't be medicating,
we shouldn't be hospitalizing,

00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:36.780
it's a bunch of blessings.

00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:38.850
And it is even
continued to this day.

00:43:38.850 --> 00:43:41.900
The quote that I put on the
top of the handout, Andrew

00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:45.430
Wild, who is one of the gurus of
sort of complementary medicine,

00:43:45.430 --> 00:43:49.880
and you'll see an absolutely
ridiculous statement

00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:53.040
there along the lines
of the hidden blessings

00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:54.360
of schizophrenia.

00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:56.940
There were movies at
that time, King of Hearts

00:43:56.940 --> 00:44:01.410
was one, very popular
one about somebody having

00:44:01.410 --> 00:44:05.840
to hide from the police or who
knows what, and the asylum,

00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:08.130
and eventually releasing
the schizophrenics who

00:44:08.130 --> 00:44:10.850
were so much saner than
the other people around,

00:44:10.850 --> 00:44:11.660
and heartwarming.

00:44:11.660 --> 00:44:16.440
And all you need to do is be
schizophrenic or know someone

00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:19.650
who is or have a family
member and you will see

00:44:19.650 --> 00:44:21.710
there are no hidden blessings.

00:44:21.710 --> 00:44:24.870
This is not a disease
of hidden compensations

00:44:24.870 --> 00:44:26.790
and more insight into the world.

00:44:26.790 --> 00:44:31.320
This is one of the most horrific
ways that biology can go wrong.

00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:33.350
And one of the best
demonstrations of it

00:44:33.350 --> 00:44:37.020
is half of schizophrenics
attempt suicide.

00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:40.990
And the more often you
have periods of remission,

00:44:40.990 --> 00:44:44.090
the more likely you
are to commit suicide.

00:44:44.090 --> 00:44:46.140
What's the significance of that?

00:44:46.140 --> 00:44:48.650
The more often you
have periods where

00:44:48.650 --> 00:44:51.420
you're clear-headed enough
to see what your life is

00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:53.780
like the rest of the
time, the more likely

00:44:53.780 --> 00:44:55.990
you are to try to kill yourself.

00:44:55.990 --> 00:45:00.530
A disease with no hidden
blessings whatsoever.

00:45:00.530 --> 00:45:03.800
Other features of it,
there's an aging component,

00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:05.230
two different forms.

00:45:05.230 --> 00:45:08.820
First one is as schizophrenics
become older, elderly,

00:45:08.820 --> 00:45:12.830
what you see is the positive
symptoms tend to disappear.

00:45:12.830 --> 00:45:15.540
The hallucinations get
damp, the delusions,

00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:18.970
the loose associations, and
the negative symptomatology

00:45:18.970 --> 00:45:22.990
is what comes to the forefront,
this world of just flat affect

00:45:22.990 --> 00:45:24.650
and withdrawal.

00:45:24.650 --> 00:45:27.370
The other age feature of
it we will hear about it

00:45:27.370 --> 00:45:30.380
in a bit, which is
real defining, which

00:45:30.380 --> 00:45:32.590
is schizophrenia
is a disease where,

00:45:32.590 --> 00:45:34.800
in the vast majority
of the sufferers,

00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:38.720
it has late adolescence,
early adulthood onset.

00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:41.790
It is a disease of
18 year olds who

00:45:41.790 --> 00:45:44.260
come down with a diagnosis
for the first time.

00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:47.180
If you make it to age 30
without schizophrenia,

00:45:47.180 --> 00:45:49.950
you have virtually no
chance of ever having it.

00:45:49.950 --> 00:45:52.966
It is a disease of
adolescent onset.

00:45:52.966 --> 00:45:54.340
And this is going
to fit with two

00:45:54.340 --> 00:45:56.030
things we'll be talking about.

00:45:56.030 --> 00:45:58.940
One is the
epidemiological evidence

00:45:58.940 --> 00:46:01.930
showing that what
schizophrenic attacks-- what

00:46:01.930 --> 00:46:04.930
schizophrenic breaks typically
are at the very beginning

00:46:04.930 --> 00:46:07.750
are in response to
major stressors.

00:46:07.750 --> 00:46:10.410
These are individuals
who have always

00:46:10.410 --> 00:46:13.770
been a little bit odd,
who, in elementary school,

00:46:13.770 --> 00:46:17.900
had imaginary playmates far
later than most other kids did,

00:46:17.900 --> 00:46:20.600
who had all sorts of
periods where they seemed

00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:23.930
not to be paying attention and
lost in their own thoughts, who

00:46:23.930 --> 00:46:27.360
had trouble making
friends, but they were OK.

00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:29.260
They were sort of hanging on.

00:46:29.260 --> 00:46:32.150
And then it was
late in high school

00:46:32.150 --> 00:46:36.720
when they had the car accident,
or the first boyfriend was

00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:39.100
so horrible to them,
or the parent died,

00:46:39.100 --> 00:46:43.710
or whatever the crisis was,
and this person who was just

00:46:43.710 --> 00:46:47.020
sort of holding on, that's
where the dip occurs,

00:46:47.020 --> 00:46:48.750
and that's where it crashes.

00:46:48.750 --> 00:46:51.980
Schizophrenia as an
adolescent onset disease

00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:56.440
where stress plays a
major precipitating role.

00:46:56.440 --> 00:46:59.100
The other piece that
we'll see is the fact

00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:02.070
that schizophrenia almost
certainly is heavily

00:47:02.070 --> 00:47:04.360
anchored in the frontal cortex.

00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:07.870
Frontal cortex, you
remember the frontal cortex.

00:47:07.870 --> 00:47:10.080
Frontal cortex, which
is not fully mature

00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:16.080
until age 25 or so, the last
big burst of frontal maturation,

00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:18.360
late adolescence
or early adulthood,

00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:20.050
we'll see there's
lots of reasons

00:47:20.050 --> 00:47:22.810
to think that schizophrenia
is a disease where,

00:47:22.810 --> 00:47:27.310
around late adolescence,
a fragile, vulnerable

00:47:27.310 --> 00:47:30.700
frontal cortex gets kicked
once too hard with something

00:47:30.700 --> 00:47:31.210
or other.

00:47:31.210 --> 00:47:33.900
And that's one where
the problems emerge.

00:47:33.900 --> 00:47:35.710
A couple of other
features, demography

00:47:35.710 --> 00:47:38.810
in every culture ever
looked at on Earth, 1% to 2%

00:47:38.810 --> 00:47:40.990
of the population
comes down with it,

00:47:40.990 --> 00:47:44.130
no gender differences,
no social economic status

00:47:44.130 --> 00:47:46.720
differences in terms of
who becomes a friend.

00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:50.540
But once you are, there
is the not very surprising

00:47:50.540 --> 00:47:53.410
downward socioeconomic
spiral, which

00:47:53.410 --> 00:47:56.250
is, no surprise, people
who are schizophrenic

00:47:56.250 --> 00:47:59.840
do not make very good CEOs
of large corporations.

00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:01.470
These are the street people.

00:48:01.470 --> 00:48:02.780
These are the homeless.

00:48:02.780 --> 00:48:06.160
The majority of people living
on streets in this country

00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:09.940
are individuals who are
schizophrenic, not alcoholic.

00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:12.780
That is the far more
common thing that you see.

00:48:12.780 --> 00:48:16.510
So a disease of complete
collapse into some of the least

00:48:16.510 --> 00:48:20.260
cared for sort of strata
of society, that is part

00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:22.640
of the demographics as well.

00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:24.686
So that's what the
disease looks like.

00:48:24.686 --> 00:48:26.810
And if you're really thinking
about these symptoms,

00:48:26.810 --> 00:48:29.010
at this point, you
should be jumping out

00:48:29.010 --> 00:48:30.910
of your chair
because of something

00:48:30.910 --> 00:48:35.750
really disturbing about
this collection of symptoms.

00:48:35.750 --> 00:48:37.540
So what is schizophrenia?

00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:41.310
It's a disease of
thinking abnormally.

00:48:41.310 --> 00:48:45.730
This is a disease of thinking
differently from everyone else.

00:48:45.730 --> 00:48:49.160
This is a disease of thinking,
in a way, that everyone

00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:51.240
else thinks isn't right.

00:48:51.240 --> 00:48:55.140
And, suddenly, we are skating on
thin ice of this transitioning

00:48:55.140 --> 00:48:59.550
from a world of neuropsychiatric
disorders and medicine

00:48:59.550 --> 00:49:03.630
into a world of all sorts
of hidden agendas of abuse.

00:49:03.630 --> 00:49:06.400
And psychiatry has
been hand in hand

00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:10.330
in bed with all sorts of
ideologues over the decades,

00:49:10.330 --> 00:49:14.260
over the years, and willing
to hand out diagnoses

00:49:14.260 --> 00:49:17.170
of schizophrenia to
political dissidents,

00:49:17.170 --> 00:49:19.180
to people you want
to get rid of.

00:49:19.180 --> 00:49:23.070
And this is a totally
loaded, loaded diagnosis,

00:49:23.070 --> 00:49:25.620
when, most
fundamentally, this is

00:49:25.620 --> 00:49:27.990
a disease of
everybody else thinks

00:49:27.990 --> 00:49:29.470
you're not thinking normally.

00:49:29.470 --> 00:49:31.270
Because, some of the
time, that describes

00:49:31.270 --> 00:49:34.620
a florid psychiatric disease
that destroys your life.

00:49:34.620 --> 00:49:36.740
And some of the time,
it describes people

00:49:36.740 --> 00:49:38.420
who are just a pain in the ass.

00:49:38.420 --> 00:49:40.050
And some of the
time, it describes

00:49:40.050 --> 00:49:42.630
people who are going to
transform the world by thinking

00:49:42.630 --> 00:49:43.720
differently.

00:49:43.720 --> 00:49:47.000
How can you possibly
approach this disease

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:49.980
in an objective way
rather than it having just

00:49:49.980 --> 00:49:52.460
shot through with ideology?

00:49:52.460 --> 00:49:54.747
And one of the ways in
which this can happen,

00:49:54.747 --> 00:49:56.830
one of the ways where you
get some grounding in it

00:49:56.830 --> 00:50:01.240
is to look at what the disease
appears like in other cultures,

00:50:01.240 --> 00:50:03.910
because you begin to
see the commonalities.

00:50:03.910 --> 00:50:06.260
And this begins to impress
you with the notion

00:50:06.260 --> 00:50:09.500
that there is, in fact, a
core set of dysfunctions

00:50:09.500 --> 00:50:10.740
to the disease.

00:50:10.740 --> 00:50:13.000
So let me tell you
about the one case

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:16.712
of cross-cultural schizophrenia
I have ever been exposed to.

00:50:16.712 --> 00:50:18.920
And I was going to bring
slides, but I couldn't quite

00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:20.440
figure out how to scan them.

00:50:20.440 --> 00:50:22.380
So maybe eight
years from now, I'll

00:50:22.380 --> 00:50:24.260
get together for
that technology.

00:50:24.260 --> 00:50:28.550
But it has to do with the time
I spent in Africa and my nearest

00:50:28.550 --> 00:50:29.330
neighbors.

00:50:29.330 --> 00:50:33.100
Nearest neighbors there are
from a tribe called the Maasai.

00:50:33.100 --> 00:50:35.240
These are nomadic pastoralists.

00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:38.660
And these are not
the folks next door.

00:50:38.660 --> 00:50:40.980
This is as different
of a culture

00:50:40.980 --> 00:50:43.180
as you could find
on this planet.

00:50:43.180 --> 00:50:47.320
Men, around puberty,
boys around puberty

00:50:47.320 --> 00:50:50.220
become warriors, spend the
next 10 years in their warrior

00:50:50.220 --> 00:50:53.260
clans, as we've heard about,
pillaging the neighbors,

00:50:53.260 --> 00:50:56.150
getting killed in
return around age 25.

00:50:56.150 --> 00:50:59.240
As elders, they settle down
and marry their first wife,

00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:00.880
typically a 13 year old.

00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:03.990
And, well, as soon as
they can, add on more.

00:51:03.990 --> 00:51:06.660
This is a culture with,
up until recently,

00:51:06.660 --> 00:51:08.900
a life expectancy in the 30s.

00:51:08.900 --> 00:51:13.520
This is a culture where people
believe in all sorts of things

00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:15.530
that we would view
as being paranormal.

00:51:15.530 --> 00:51:19.260
This is a culture in which
people celebrate events

00:51:19.260 --> 00:51:22.050
by drinking tureens
of cow blood.

00:51:22.050 --> 00:51:25.510
This is a very different
bunch of folks.

00:51:25.510 --> 00:51:27.770
Let me tell you about
the one schizophrenic

00:51:27.770 --> 00:51:29.830
Maasai who I've ever seen.

00:51:29.830 --> 00:51:32.340
And this was about 25 years ago.

00:51:32.340 --> 00:51:37.320
And I was in my camp, which was
a few miles away from this one

00:51:37.320 --> 00:51:38.820
village where I
knew a lot of folks,

00:51:38.820 --> 00:51:40.540
and just sitting there
minding my own business.

00:51:40.540 --> 00:51:41.914
And I had this
one woman in there

00:51:41.914 --> 00:51:46.420
who was my-- closest friend
or whatever in the village.

00:51:46.420 --> 00:51:49.590
And I suddenly see
she is running up

00:51:49.590 --> 00:51:51.500
the mountain with a
bunch of the other women

00:51:51.500 --> 00:51:55.070
from the village in this
completely agitated state.

00:51:55.070 --> 00:51:59.720
They come roaring into my camp,
totally flummoxed and just

00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:02.040
like completely agitated.

00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:05.670
These are people who do not
get agitated over things very

00:52:05.670 --> 00:52:06.430
readily.

00:52:06.430 --> 00:52:08.370
These are people who,
as a puberty right,

00:52:08.370 --> 00:52:11.430
have to go out and kill a
lion or don't come back.

00:52:11.430 --> 00:52:14.430
So when Maasai are getting
all crazed about something,

00:52:14.430 --> 00:52:16.530
this is something worth
paying attention to.

00:52:16.530 --> 00:52:19.300
They're totally crazed and
they're saying somebody

00:52:19.300 --> 00:52:21.870
in the village has done
something very wrong

00:52:21.870 --> 00:52:23.800
and I need to come
and help them.

00:52:23.800 --> 00:52:26.427
It turns out what they wanted
me to do was bring my car.

00:52:26.427 --> 00:52:28.510
That's the way in which I
was going to be helpful.

00:52:28.510 --> 00:52:30.570
So they impressed
me into doing this.

00:52:30.570 --> 00:52:32.540
And we all pile into
the car and started

00:52:32.540 --> 00:52:35.180
driving down and heading
towards the village.

00:52:35.180 --> 00:52:37.220
And as we're getting
there, I'm beginning

00:52:37.220 --> 00:52:39.400
to get some information.

00:52:39.400 --> 00:52:42.680
And what I see is
them telling me

00:52:42.680 --> 00:52:44.980
about a woman in
the village who's

00:52:44.980 --> 00:52:47.790
done something
wildly inappropriate

00:52:47.790 --> 00:52:49.930
and they've had it with her.

00:52:49.930 --> 00:52:52.640
Now, I had been around that
area for about four years,

00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:55.590
at that point, knew most of
the people in that village.

00:52:55.590 --> 00:52:58.810
And this was someone who
I had never encountered.

00:52:58.810 --> 00:53:03.260
A-ha, socially isolated,
living in the back of some hut

00:53:03.260 --> 00:53:07.450
at the far corner of the
village, a first sort of hint.

00:53:07.450 --> 00:53:09.790
So they're describing
to me that she has

00:53:09.790 --> 00:53:11.530
done something inappropriate.

00:53:11.530 --> 00:53:14.310
She has killed a goat.

00:53:14.310 --> 00:53:15.500
You don't do that.

00:53:15.500 --> 00:53:17.790
You don't do that
if you are a woman.

00:53:17.790 --> 00:53:20.030
You don't do that if
it is not a ceremony.

00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:21.950
You don't do it the
way she has done it.

00:53:21.950 --> 00:53:24.800
She has grabbed
somebody's goat and ripped

00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:28.480
its throat open with her teeth
and was now there with a goat.

00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:31.000
And everybody had
had it with her.

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:33.090
So we're driving there
and I'm listening to this,

00:53:33.090 --> 00:53:36.960
and I'm saying, whoa, this
sounds like a psychotic break.

00:53:36.960 --> 00:53:38.720
This is going to be cool.

00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:40.470
This is going to be
really interesting.

00:53:40.470 --> 00:53:43.510
I wonder what it'll be
like to talk to the family

00:53:43.510 --> 00:53:45.660
and find out what the
symptoms have been.

00:53:45.660 --> 00:53:47.920
Or I wonder if she's
going to have any insight.

00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:50.450
It's going to be fascinating
to talk to her about this.

00:53:50.450 --> 00:53:52.200
So I get into the
village, and this person

00:53:52.200 --> 00:53:54.960
I was now planning to have some
good heart to hearts with about

00:53:54.960 --> 00:54:00.950
their tangential thinking, out
comes this huge naked woman

00:54:00.950 --> 00:54:05.400
with a goat in her mouth by the
throat, covered in goat blood,

00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:07.410
and goat urine, and goat shit.

00:54:07.410 --> 00:54:10.730
And this woman gives this
howling yell, charges

00:54:10.730 --> 00:54:12.950
across the village, knocks
me over, and attempts

00:54:12.950 --> 00:54:13.670
to strangle me.

00:54:16.950 --> 00:54:24.550
I'm a normal kind of
guy, normal fantasy life.

00:54:24.550 --> 00:54:28.095
Never once in the darkest
recesses of my mind

00:54:28.095 --> 00:54:31.079
did this strike me as
something that was appealing.

00:54:31.079 --> 00:54:32.620
I'm lying there,
she's throttling me.

00:54:32.620 --> 00:54:35.570
I'm thinking this is how
I'm going to wind up dying.

00:54:35.570 --> 00:54:37.290
My poor parents
are going to have

00:54:37.290 --> 00:54:40.020
to deal with the stigma of this
for the rest of their lives,

00:54:40.020 --> 00:54:42.070
that this is-- he's
done in by someone

00:54:42.070 --> 00:54:44.194
with a goat in her
mouth, and thinking that.

00:54:44.194 --> 00:54:46.610
So, fortunately, everybody
else was much more clear-headed

00:54:46.610 --> 00:54:47.900
and they pull her off me.

00:54:47.900 --> 00:54:50.570
And what they proceed to do
is push her into my Jeep.

00:54:50.570 --> 00:54:54.040
And they pile on top of
her and they say let's go.

00:54:54.040 --> 00:54:58.200
So I collect myself and leap in
and we head off driving there.

00:54:58.200 --> 00:55:02.100
And this woman was floridly
out of control of there.

00:55:02.100 --> 00:55:05.440
But we're driving somewhere.

00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:06.510
Where are we driving?

00:55:06.510 --> 00:55:09.330
We're driving to the nearest
government clinic, which

00:55:09.330 --> 00:55:12.050
was about 25 miles
away and consisted

00:55:12.050 --> 00:55:14.180
of a wood shack
and a nurse there,

00:55:14.180 --> 00:55:16.460
a government nurse, who
as a result of this three

00:55:16.460 --> 00:55:19.200
weeks of training, gave
out malarial medication

00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:21.460
for anything you came
to complain about.

00:55:21.460 --> 00:55:23.400
And what they were
going to do was

00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:26.320
they wanted to get rid of her.

00:55:26.320 --> 00:55:28.875
So we go driving and we
eventually get to this clinic.

00:55:28.875 --> 00:55:32.190
Well, what they proceed to
do is push her into the hut

00:55:32.190 --> 00:55:34.680
and hammer the door closed.

00:55:34.680 --> 00:55:36.180
So I'm sitting
there, at this point,

00:55:36.180 --> 00:55:39.680
saying, OK, well,
we've containment.

00:55:39.680 --> 00:55:41.540
So what do we now?

00:55:41.540 --> 00:55:43.500
Do we-- do we talk to her?

00:55:43.500 --> 00:55:45.864
Does the nurse talk to-- do
we go and get the family?

00:55:45.864 --> 00:55:47.530
What are you-- so I
turned to my friends

00:55:47.530 --> 00:55:48.988
there and say so
what do we do now.

00:55:48.988 --> 00:55:51.460
And they say let's get
the hell out of here,

00:55:51.460 --> 00:55:53.170
showing an important thing.

00:55:53.170 --> 00:55:55.950
Even in a culture as
different from ours,

00:55:55.950 --> 00:55:59.320
nobody has a whole lot of
tolerance for the mentally ill.

00:55:59.320 --> 00:56:01.210
Let's get out of here.

00:56:01.210 --> 00:56:03.690
So they persuade me to go.

00:56:03.690 --> 00:56:06.960
We get into the vehicle and
start the long drive back.

00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:09.710
After a while, the
car's aired out a bit

00:56:09.710 --> 00:56:11.600
and everybody's
calming down a bit.

00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:14.220
And I decide this was wonderful.

00:56:14.220 --> 00:56:16.500
What a marvelous
opportunity to learn

00:56:16.500 --> 00:56:19.710
about some cross-cultural
psychiatry or whatever.

00:56:19.710 --> 00:56:22.230
So I turned to my friend
who's sitting next to me there

00:56:22.230 --> 00:56:26.000
and I say so what do you think
was wrong with that woman.

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:27.550
And she looks at
me as I'm an idiot.

00:56:27.550 --> 00:56:29.410
She says she's crazy.

00:56:29.410 --> 00:56:31.072
And I said, well,
how do you know.

00:56:31.072 --> 00:56:31.770
How do you know?

00:56:31.770 --> 00:56:34.170
And she said she hears voices.

00:56:34.170 --> 00:56:37.060
And I say, ha, you
guys hear voices.

00:56:37.060 --> 00:56:39.510
Maasai hear voices,
they do trance dancing

00:56:39.510 --> 00:56:42.550
before they do sort of these
around the clock cattle runs.

00:56:42.550 --> 00:56:45.190
They hear voices of
ghosts, that sort of thing.

00:56:45.190 --> 00:56:48.670
I say to her what's the
big deal, you hear voices.

00:56:48.670 --> 00:56:50.810
And she says, no, no,
no, it's different.

00:56:50.810 --> 00:56:54.060
Then I say, well, what
else was she doing wrong.

00:56:54.060 --> 00:56:56.300
And she says she killed a goat.

00:56:56.300 --> 00:56:58.620
And I say you guys kill goats.

00:56:58.620 --> 00:57:01.640
But, again, this
wasn't how it's done.

00:57:01.640 --> 00:57:04.600
There is an old longstanding
belief among Maasai men

00:57:04.600 --> 00:57:08.520
that it is very bad luck to
have women observe eating meat,

00:57:08.520 --> 00:57:11.770
so they get to go off on their
own and eat all the goat meat.

00:57:11.770 --> 00:57:13.690
And it's done in a
certain ritualized way.

00:57:13.690 --> 00:57:16.360
You do not kill a goat
if you are a woman,

00:57:16.360 --> 00:57:18.520
if you are a naked,
yelling banshee

00:57:18.520 --> 00:57:21.960
of a woman in the middle of the
village with your bare hands

00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:22.770
and teeth.

00:57:22.770 --> 00:57:24.230
You don't do this.

00:57:24.230 --> 00:57:26.560
So I'm sitting there
and I'm saying, well,

00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:29.390
do you know this-- it's
kind of hard for me

00:57:29.390 --> 00:57:31.190
to tell the difference here.

00:57:31.190 --> 00:57:33.860
And she says, in
the sense, idiot,

00:57:33.860 --> 00:57:38.250
she hears voices
at the wrong time.

00:57:38.250 --> 00:57:41.500
And that's the core,
ultimately, of the objectivity

00:57:41.500 --> 00:57:43.220
that's needed in this disease.

00:57:43.220 --> 00:57:47.030
In order to understand what
counts as abnormal thought,

00:57:47.030 --> 00:57:49.640
you first have
the huge challenge

00:57:49.640 --> 00:57:51.840
of understanding all
the different ways

00:57:51.840 --> 00:57:54.350
that normal thought
can manifest itself.

00:57:54.350 --> 00:57:58.860
And that is a classic problem in
training psychiatrists sitting

00:57:58.860 --> 00:58:01.480
in some inner city
clinic recognizing

00:58:01.480 --> 00:58:03.820
that the amount of
cultural variety there,

00:58:03.820 --> 00:58:06.670
or the different ways in
which you can be normal,

00:58:06.670 --> 00:58:09.780
is extraordinary and
extraordinarily challenging

00:58:09.780 --> 00:58:10.660
at times.

00:58:10.660 --> 00:58:12.875
You are on very
thin ice deciding

00:58:12.875 --> 00:58:15.910
you know what counts
as abnormal thinking

00:58:15.910 --> 00:58:18.030
before you have
a very wide sense

00:58:18.030 --> 00:58:21.760
of what can count as normal.

00:58:21.760 --> 00:58:24.380
So now let's take a
five minute break.

00:58:24.380 --> 00:58:28.340
And all sorts of very
accomplished artists

00:58:28.340 --> 00:58:31.190
over the years who've turned
out to be schizophrenic.

00:58:31.190 --> 00:58:34.440
And schizophrenia is not what
made their creativity possible,

00:58:34.440 --> 00:58:37.180
schizophrenia is what
destroyed their careers.

00:58:37.180 --> 00:58:40.670
Other question is so what
happened to that woman.

00:58:40.670 --> 00:58:44.820
And this was shortly before I
was coming back to the states.

00:58:44.820 --> 00:58:47.447
And it was about nine months
later that I went back there.

00:58:47.447 --> 00:58:49.030
And some point, when
seeing my friend,

00:58:49.030 --> 00:58:51.470
saying whatever
happened to that woman.

00:58:51.470 --> 00:58:55.110
And her response
was, oh, she died.

00:58:55.110 --> 00:58:58.870
Maasai do not like to
stay indoors, she died.

00:58:58.870 --> 00:59:01.710
That's all I ever
found out, once again,

00:59:01.710 --> 00:59:04.490
as different to the culture
on Earth as you can imagine.

00:59:04.490 --> 00:59:09.510
And they are no more tolerant
of the mentally ill than we are.

00:59:09.510 --> 00:59:11.940
So now, beginning the
neurochemistry of it,

00:59:11.940 --> 00:59:13.950
what's going on in
the brain, what's

00:59:13.950 --> 00:59:15.600
going on with brain chemistry?

00:59:15.600 --> 00:59:17.240
And for decades
and decades, there

00:59:17.240 --> 00:59:20.790
has been one dominant model
for schizophrenia, which

00:59:20.790 --> 00:59:25.610
is the dopamine hypothesis,
the notion that somewhere

00:59:25.610 --> 00:59:27.660
in the brain, stay
tuned, there is

00:59:27.660 --> 00:59:32.020
an excess of dopamine
winding up in the synapses.

00:59:32.020 --> 00:59:34.070
What's the evidence for it?

00:59:34.070 --> 00:59:36.420
First off, you do
things like look

00:59:36.420 --> 00:59:41.030
at levels of dopamine breakdown
products in the bloodstream,

00:59:41.030 --> 00:59:43.270
in the urine, in the
cerebral spinal fluid,

00:59:43.270 --> 00:59:47.220
tending to be elevated
in schizophrenics.

00:59:47.220 --> 00:59:50.970
Next, what you see is
the most important fact

00:59:50.970 --> 00:59:53.940
which is all of the
classic drugs that

00:59:53.940 --> 00:59:58.630
work with schizophrenia
block dopamine receptors.

00:59:58.630 --> 01:00:00.940
Anti-psychotic
drugs, neuroleptics,

01:00:00.940 --> 01:00:04.590
Haldol, Thorazine, when,
at some exciting moment

01:00:04.590 --> 01:00:09.000
in the made for TV movie,
where the person has gone mad

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.530
in the ER and someone
yells for a syringe,

01:00:11.530 --> 01:00:13.920
they're yelling for a syringe
of something that will

01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:16.610
block the dopamine receptors.

01:00:16.610 --> 01:00:21.530
If you give schizophrenics
dopamine or some drug that

01:00:21.530 --> 01:00:24.550
activates dopamine
receptors, their symptoms

01:00:24.550 --> 01:00:27.080
get worse, which kind
of makes you wonder who

01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:28.560
approved that kind of study.

01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:30.510
That doesn't sound very logical.

01:00:30.510 --> 01:00:33.720
You look post-mortem at the
brains of schizophrenics

01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:37.470
and there's elevated levels
of dopamine receptors

01:00:37.470 --> 01:00:40.100
in the frontal cortex.

01:00:40.100 --> 01:00:43.650
So we have a whole bunch of
ways that things can go wrong.

01:00:43.650 --> 01:00:46.670
We can have too much
dopamine coming out,

01:00:46.670 --> 01:00:48.010
for some reason or other.

01:00:48.010 --> 01:00:50.700
We can have too many
dopamine receptors,

01:00:50.700 --> 01:00:52.320
enhanced sensitivity.

01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:55.550
We know another possible
way, which is dopamine

01:00:55.550 --> 01:00:58.630
is then broken down
by this is enzyme.

01:00:58.630 --> 01:01:01.580
And if this enzyme
isn't working very well,

01:01:01.580 --> 01:01:03.580
levels are going to accumulate.

01:01:03.580 --> 01:01:06.200
And there's a bit of
evidence of abnormalities

01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:09.810
of this enzyme in
some individuals.

01:01:09.810 --> 01:01:11.630
So one additional
interesting piece

01:01:11.630 --> 01:01:13.960
of evidence for this
dopamine hypothesis,

01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:15.777
which seemed absolutely
clear by now,

01:01:15.777 --> 01:01:17.360
you have somebody
who's schizophrenic,

01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:20.160
you give them a drug that
blocks dopamine receptors

01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:23.190
and thus decreases the
dopaminergic signaling,

01:01:23.190 --> 01:01:25.030
and they start getting better.

01:01:25.030 --> 01:01:27.260
What's your
hypothesis have to be?

01:01:27.260 --> 01:01:29.810
I bet you they had
too much dopamine.

01:01:29.810 --> 01:01:32.580
This is shown in
another interesting way.

01:01:32.580 --> 01:01:35.000
18 counties over in
the brain from where

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:36.853
dopamine's got something
to do with this,

01:01:36.853 --> 01:01:39.100
dopamine serves another role.

01:01:39.100 --> 01:01:42.790
In a motor system related
to the basal ganglia, all

01:01:42.790 --> 01:01:46.810
of that, involved in fine motor
control, a part of the brain

01:01:46.810 --> 01:01:48.820
called the substantia nigra.

01:01:48.820 --> 01:01:51.020
And if you get a little
bit of damage there,

01:01:51.020 --> 01:01:53.340
I think I mentioned
a couple extras ago,

01:01:53.340 --> 01:01:55.610
you get the tremor of old age.

01:01:55.610 --> 01:01:57.740
If you get a lot
of damage there,

01:01:57.740 --> 01:02:00.300
you got yourself
Parkinson's disease.

01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:02.210
And what occurs
in Parkinson's is

01:02:02.210 --> 01:02:06.760
90% of the neurons in
the substantia nigra die.

01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:09.420
And people are even
beginning to understand why.

01:02:09.420 --> 01:02:11.860
These are dopaminergic neurons.

01:02:11.860 --> 01:02:15.620
Parkinson's is a disease
of losing all the dopamine

01:02:15.620 --> 01:02:18.330
signaling in this
part of the brain.

01:02:18.330 --> 01:02:20.570
People began to figure
this out in the early '60s.

01:02:20.570 --> 01:02:23.790
And out of that came one of
the first drug treatments

01:02:23.790 --> 01:02:25.610
for any neurological disease.

01:02:25.610 --> 01:02:26.930
What's the strategy?

01:02:26.930 --> 01:02:28.800
These are people
who have too little

01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:31.230
dopamine in this
part of the brain.

01:02:31.230 --> 01:02:33.559
Give them replacement dopamine.

01:02:33.559 --> 01:02:35.600
Turns out it's hard to
get dopamine in the brain,

01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:38.330
so you would give
people one step earlier

01:02:38.330 --> 01:02:42.125
in the biosynthesis
a drug called L-DOPA.

01:02:42.125 --> 01:02:44.940
L-DOPA, which then gets
converted into dopamine,

01:02:44.940 --> 01:02:47.800
and this was miraculous.

01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:50.200
All sorts of people
who were just

01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:53.240
paralysed with their
Parkinson's, L-DOPE

01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:55.070
suddenly liberated them.

01:02:55.070 --> 01:02:58.675
There's a movie 15
years ago or so,

01:02:58.675 --> 01:03:01.390
called Awakenings
with Robin Williams,

01:03:01.390 --> 01:03:03.470
which was based on a
book by Oliver Sacks,

01:03:03.470 --> 01:03:05.590
based on his own
work, which had to do

01:03:05.590 --> 01:03:09.380
with this rare disease that
emerged after World War I,

01:03:09.380 --> 01:03:12.840
having something to do with
the influenza pandemic, then

01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:16.440
a post-encephalitic
paralysis, which became

01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:19.260
known as stiff man syndrome.

01:03:19.260 --> 01:03:22.010
And people who were
essentially frozen in place,

01:03:22.010 --> 01:03:25.320
and what we now know is it's
an autoimmune disorder that

01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:27.660
targets something with
the dopamine system.

01:03:27.660 --> 01:03:31.240
Sacks was a medical resident at
the time, was-- at that point,

01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:34.260
the L-DOPA stuff was just
coming out with Parkinson's.

01:03:34.260 --> 01:03:36.850
And Sacks was the one
who had the insight

01:03:36.850 --> 01:03:39.860
to say I bet the
stiff man syndrome is

01:03:39.860 --> 01:03:43.970
a case of the most extreme
severe Parkinson's that you

01:03:43.970 --> 01:03:45.010
could possibly get.

01:03:45.010 --> 01:03:47.600
And, thus, he was the first
one to try L-DOPA on people

01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:51.690
with the syndrome, and thus
you had miraculous awakenings,

01:03:51.690 --> 01:03:55.060
people moving voluntarily for
the first time in decades,

01:03:55.060 --> 01:03:57.490
totally amazing.

01:03:57.490 --> 01:03:59.320
But then, you have a downside.

01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:01.360
And the downside
that we know sort

01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:03.000
of the structure
of by now, you've

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:06.970
got a problem with dopamine
in the substantia nigra,

01:04:06.970 --> 01:04:09.210
lower than normal levels.

01:04:09.210 --> 01:04:12.330
Everywhere else in the brain,
you've got normal levels.

01:04:12.330 --> 01:04:14.510
So you're trying to
fix up this depletion,

01:04:14.510 --> 01:04:16.780
you give the person L-DOPA.

01:04:16.780 --> 01:04:20.120
But you're not spritzing it
into their substantia nigra,

01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:22.900
you're putting it in their
stomach or their bloodstream.

01:04:22.900 --> 01:04:27.070
You are raising dopamine
levels in the substantia nigra

01:04:27.070 --> 01:04:29.580
and things get better,
but you're also raising it

01:04:29.580 --> 01:04:31.880
everywhere else in the brain.

01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:36.140
And what you wind up seeing
is if you give a Parkinsonian

01:04:36.140 --> 01:04:40.420
patient too much L-DOPA,
they become psychotic.

01:04:40.420 --> 01:04:43.960
They are indistinguishable
from a schizophrenic.

01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:46.670
And what was shown in the
movie was this character

01:04:46.670 --> 01:04:48.580
played by Robert
De Niro wound up

01:04:48.580 --> 01:04:53.110
having this florid paranoid
psychosis from the L-DOPA,

01:04:53.110 --> 01:04:55.170
so, oh, that being
more evidence,

01:04:55.170 --> 01:04:58.070
you give a drug that
raises dopamine levels

01:04:58.070 --> 01:04:59.970
throughout the
brain and somebody

01:04:59.970 --> 01:05:02.170
starts acting schizophrenic.

01:05:02.170 --> 01:05:06.020
You give somebody a drug that
causes very rapid dumping

01:05:06.020 --> 01:05:08.790
of dopamine, and
they will transiently

01:05:08.790 --> 01:05:10.110
appear schizophrenic.

01:05:10.110 --> 01:05:11.090
What's the drug?

01:05:11.090 --> 01:05:13.110
That's what amphetamines do.

01:05:13.110 --> 01:05:17.060
And you get somebody coming to
an ER who is loose associations

01:05:17.060 --> 01:05:19.350
and hallucinating
delusions and all of that,

01:05:19.350 --> 01:05:22.900
and most clinicians cannot tell
whether this was somebody with

01:05:22.900 --> 01:05:25.270
an amphetamine psychosis
or schizophrenia.

01:05:25.270 --> 01:05:26.620
Pump their stomach out.

01:05:26.620 --> 01:05:28.950
If they suddenly start
making more sense,

01:05:28.950 --> 01:05:31.060
it was probably
the amphetamines.

01:05:31.060 --> 01:05:33.000
So this being more evidence.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:36.260
Now, you should be thinking
what about the flip side.

01:05:36.260 --> 01:05:39.030
So you have schizophrenics,
where you give them

01:05:39.030 --> 01:05:43.070
these neuroleptic drugs to
block dopamine receptors

01:05:43.070 --> 01:05:44.794
in the frontal cortex,
as it turns out.

01:05:44.794 --> 01:05:46.710
But you're not injecting
it straight in there,

01:05:46.710 --> 01:05:47.835
you're putting in the guts.

01:05:47.835 --> 01:05:50.120
And, now, you've got
too much dopamine here.

01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:53.000
You lower its levels,
but everywhere else it

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.410
gets a little lower than
normal-- not dopamine levels,

01:05:55.410 --> 01:05:56.910
but dopamine signaling.

01:05:56.910 --> 01:05:59.840
And, suddenly, you should
generate this prediction

01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:02.430
that if you over
medicate schizophrenics,

01:06:02.430 --> 01:06:05.370
they should start looking as if
they have Parkinson's disease.

01:06:05.370 --> 01:06:07.930
And that's exactly
what you see as well,

01:06:07.930 --> 01:06:12.010
a disorder called tardive
dyskinesia, kinetics,

01:06:12.010 --> 01:06:14.240
body movement
dyskinesia, abnormal one.

01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:17.810
And these are individuals
who look Parkinsonian.

01:06:17.810 --> 01:06:20.920
Go into a state hospital,
go into the back ward,

01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:22.500
and find somebody
sitting there who

01:06:22.500 --> 01:06:25.625
is tremoring like this all over
their body the entire time.

01:06:25.625 --> 01:06:27.000
And that's somebody
who was going

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:30.830
to have been taking these
drugs for 20, 25 years or so.

01:06:30.830 --> 01:06:33.840
So, collectively, this
winds up telling you

01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:36.460
all these different ways
of suggesting the problem

01:06:36.460 --> 01:06:41.760
is that there is too much
dopamine in this disease.

01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:43.990
However, just to
make life miserable,

01:06:43.990 --> 01:06:46.850
there is at least one
anti-schizophrenic drug

01:06:46.850 --> 01:06:51.820
out there which what it does is
it increases dopamine signaling

01:06:51.820 --> 01:06:53.560
and people get better.

01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:57.260
Bummer, nobody knows what to
make of this at this point.

01:06:57.260 --> 01:06:59.850
So what's the excess
dopamine doing in there?

01:06:59.850 --> 01:07:02.220
It's not having anything
to do with movement stuff.

01:07:02.220 --> 01:07:03.570
That's substantia nigra.

01:07:03.570 --> 01:07:05.950
It's not having anything
to do with pleasure.

01:07:05.950 --> 01:07:08.370
That's dopamine in different
parts of the brain.

01:07:08.370 --> 01:07:11.040
The best evidence
is this is dopamine

01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:13.240
functioning in the
frontal cortex,

01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:16.760
stimulating normal
executive function.

01:07:16.760 --> 01:07:19.060
And what you've got
is a frontal cortex

01:07:19.060 --> 01:07:21.240
that is not making a
whole lot of sense.

01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:23.650
Loose associations,
that seems to be

01:07:23.650 --> 01:07:27.070
where the dopamine
problem is played out.

01:07:27.070 --> 01:07:29.530
Next neurotransmitter
that's been implicated,

01:07:29.530 --> 01:07:33.590
serotonin, look at the chemical
structure of serotonin,

01:07:33.590 --> 01:07:36.030
and then look at the
chemical structure of all

01:07:36.030 --> 01:07:40.770
of the major hallucinogens,
LSD, mescaline, psilocybin,

01:07:40.770 --> 01:07:43.860
they are all structurally
almost identical.

01:07:43.860 --> 01:07:48.570
And all of those hallucinogens
fit into serotonin receptors

01:07:48.570 --> 01:07:50.650
and activate them.

01:07:50.650 --> 01:07:53.550
What is a hallucination
induced by a drug?

01:07:53.550 --> 01:07:55.340
You've got some
serotonin synapse

01:07:55.340 --> 01:07:57.220
where nothing's happening.

01:07:57.220 --> 01:07:58.930
The pre-synaptic
neuron hasn't had

01:07:58.930 --> 01:08:00.640
anything interesting
to say in weeks,

01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:02.420
it hasn't released
any serotonin.

01:08:02.420 --> 01:08:05.780
But, now, there's something that
kind of looks like serotonin

01:08:05.780 --> 01:08:09.530
percolating its way into the
synapse, where it could then

01:08:09.530 --> 01:08:12.200
bind to the serotonin receptors.

01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:14.200
And as far as this
neuron thinks,

01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:16.340
it just got a
message from there.

01:08:16.340 --> 01:08:18.200
And it didn't come from there.

01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:20.880
This neuron is hearing voices.

01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:24.149
And the fact that that's how the
hallucinogens work immediately

01:08:24.149 --> 01:08:26.380
generated all
sorts of hypotheses

01:08:26.380 --> 01:08:29.970
that there are abnormalities
in serotonin in schizophrenia

01:08:29.970 --> 01:08:33.930
as well having something to
do with the hallucinations.

01:08:33.930 --> 01:08:36.680
Next, the
neurotransmitter glutamate

01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:38.260
has also been implicated.

01:08:38.260 --> 01:08:40.140
What's the evidence there?

01:08:40.140 --> 01:08:43.060
When you take a drug
that wildly stimulates

01:08:43.060 --> 01:08:45.830
one subtype of
glutamate receptor,

01:08:45.830 --> 01:08:49.470
you begin to look a bit
like a schizophrenic.

01:08:49.470 --> 01:08:50.630
What's the drug?

01:08:50.630 --> 01:08:53.880
PCP, angel dust, phencyclidine.

01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:57.029
That stimulates a subtype
of glutamate receptors.

01:08:57.029 --> 01:08:59.580
And a lot of people
have argued this

01:08:59.580 --> 01:09:02.700
has enough resemblance to
what schizophrenia looks like

01:09:02.700 --> 01:09:05.439
that there has to be a
glutamate problem going on

01:09:05.439 --> 01:09:06.430
in the disease.

01:09:06.430 --> 01:09:08.740
Very, very little
bits of evidence

01:09:08.740 --> 01:09:11.930
for that, the one thing
that has been shown in rats

01:09:11.930 --> 01:09:16.029
is when you stimulate
the brain with PCP,

01:09:16.029 --> 01:09:19.220
what you get is an increased
levels of receptors

01:09:19.220 --> 01:09:22.680
for serotonin in some
interesting parts of the brain,

01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:25.720
some kind of connection
running around there.

01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:30.060
So very, very solid implication
of dopamine, some serotonin

01:09:30.060 --> 01:09:32.529
thrown in there,
glutamate, eleventy other

01:09:32.529 --> 01:09:34.830
neurotransmitters that
people are thinking about,

01:09:34.830 --> 01:09:36.439
but these are the main ones.

01:09:36.439 --> 01:09:39.180
And, overwhelmingly,
the dominant hypothesis

01:09:39.180 --> 01:09:41.670
remains the dopamine hypothesis.

01:09:41.670 --> 01:09:43.800
What about brain metabolism?

01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:45.910
What's going on in the
brain, for example,

01:09:45.910 --> 01:09:48.250
during a hallucination?

01:09:48.250 --> 01:09:51.529
And what you essentially
get is wild activation

01:09:51.529 --> 01:09:55.340
of everywhere in the brain
and you are hallucinating.

01:09:55.340 --> 01:09:59.420
You get wild activation, people
who are in imaging studies

01:09:59.420 --> 01:10:01.910
have taken these
drugs voluntarily,

01:10:01.910 --> 01:10:04.630
you get wild activation
in the cortex,

01:10:04.630 --> 01:10:06.700
except for, say,
the first couple

01:10:06.700 --> 01:10:09.950
layers of the visual cortex,
or the first couple of layers

01:10:09.950 --> 01:10:11.420
of the auditory cortex.

01:10:11.420 --> 01:10:12.860
What's that about?

01:10:12.860 --> 01:10:16.380
The cortex is seeing
things and hearing things

01:10:16.380 --> 01:10:18.930
that did not come in from
the outside world, that

01:10:18.930 --> 01:10:22.190
never stimulated the
primary sensory cortex.

01:10:22.190 --> 01:10:24.840
Otherwise, during
hallucinations,

01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:28.340
you see extremely high
levels of metabolism

01:10:28.340 --> 01:10:30.390
throughout the brain.

01:10:30.390 --> 01:10:32.320
The next interesting
thing in that realm,

01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:34.910
you give schizophrenics
some standard declarative

01:10:34.910 --> 01:10:38.570
memory tasks and metabolism
in the hippocampus

01:10:38.570 --> 01:10:42.410
does not increase as much
as in other individuals.

01:10:42.410 --> 01:10:45.170
So that brings us to structural
features of the disease.

01:10:45.170 --> 01:10:46.116
Yeah?

01:10:46.116 --> 01:10:48.954
Does the brain--
while hallucinating,

01:10:48.954 --> 01:10:52.280
does the brain work
somewhat like when dreaming?

01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:52.970
Good question.

01:10:52.970 --> 01:10:55.490
Does the brain, in terms
of patterns of activation,

01:10:55.490 --> 01:10:57.500
look somewhat like
during dreaming?

01:10:57.500 --> 01:10:58.320
Yeah.

01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:02.040
It's not the primary sensory
cortex regions that activate.

01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:04.660
Frontal cortex is
relatively quiet.

01:11:04.660 --> 01:11:07.700
And the rest of the
brain is going like mad,

01:11:07.700 --> 01:11:10.050
and certainly makes sense.

01:11:10.050 --> 01:11:12.660
So structural stuff,
there's all sorts

01:11:12.660 --> 01:11:16.650
of structural abnormalities in
the brains of schizophrenics.

01:11:16.650 --> 01:11:18.360
How do you learn this though?

01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:21.970
Very difficult, because, for
the first couple of decades

01:11:21.970 --> 01:11:26.130
in the field, it was all
post-mortem analysis, which

01:11:26.130 --> 01:11:28.224
is you take out the
brain of a schizophrenic

01:11:28.224 --> 01:11:29.640
and you go and
look at it, and you

01:11:29.640 --> 01:11:31.370
see if there's anything weird.

01:11:31.370 --> 01:11:33.250
So what's the
problems with that?

01:11:33.250 --> 01:11:35.640
All sorts of things,
which is to try

01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:39.290
to do post-mortem studies on
human brains, different brain

01:11:39.290 --> 01:11:40.970
sit for different
lengths of time

01:11:40.970 --> 01:11:43.340
before they're
autopsied and removed.

01:11:43.340 --> 01:11:45.660
So that's a huge
piece of variability.

01:11:45.660 --> 01:11:50.020
Moreover, you can get
post-mortem artifacts,

01:11:50.020 --> 01:11:51.670
which is to say
you're pulling out

01:11:51.670 --> 01:11:54.390
the brain and somebody
squeezes it too hard

01:11:54.390 --> 01:11:56.710
and squishes something
in here and it's not

01:11:56.710 --> 01:12:00.580
going to look normal afterward,
reflecting the handling of it.

01:12:00.580 --> 01:12:03.550
And out of that has
come this whole world

01:12:03.550 --> 01:12:05.930
of neuropsychiatry
types were what they

01:12:05.930 --> 01:12:08.800
live for are rapid autopsies.

01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:10.750
And a whole bunch
of medical centers

01:12:10.750 --> 01:12:12.920
have rapid autopsy
teams connected

01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:15.460
with their Alzheimer's
folk, connected

01:12:15.460 --> 01:12:17.230
with some of the
psychiatric diseases,

01:12:17.230 --> 01:12:20.130
where their idea is to
get in there as fast

01:12:20.130 --> 01:12:22.940
as possible with
patients who have

01:12:22.940 --> 01:12:25.730
or whose family have
given permission for that

01:12:25.730 --> 01:12:28.254
and get the brain out
as fast as you can.

01:12:28.254 --> 01:12:29.670
And I remember, a
few years ago, I

01:12:29.670 --> 01:12:31.830
was down to Duke
Medical Center, and they

01:12:31.830 --> 01:12:34.940
had one of these rapid
autopsy SWAT teams.

01:12:34.940 --> 01:12:37.600
And they were bragging about
how they were getting brains out

01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:40.190
in under 30 minutes from death.

01:12:40.190 --> 01:12:44.880
So that solves a whole lot
of the post-mortem rotting

01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:46.900
away lag time.

01:12:46.900 --> 01:12:48.950
So all of those wind
up being problems.

01:12:48.950 --> 01:12:51.160
More confounds,
very often you're

01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:54.430
trying to understand the brains
of schizophrenics who have died

01:12:54.430 --> 01:12:56.690
who are older, who are elderly.

01:12:56.690 --> 01:12:58.850
And the confound there
is schizophrenics

01:12:58.850 --> 01:13:00.920
have horrible diets.

01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:04.040
You are seeing perhaps
the brain consequences

01:13:04.040 --> 01:13:07.120
of malnutrition all those
years, rather than seeing

01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:11.540
the consequences of
the disease itself.

01:13:11.540 --> 01:13:14.390
Another problem that you've
got is you get someone

01:13:14.390 --> 01:13:16.790
who's schizophrenic,
and, almost certainly,

01:13:16.790 --> 01:13:19.910
what they have been doing
for a long time is taking

01:13:19.910 --> 01:13:21.850
drugs for their schizophrenia.

01:13:21.850 --> 01:13:24.790
And if you see something
different in the brain,

01:13:24.790 --> 01:13:26.470
maybe it's due to
the schizophrenia

01:13:26.470 --> 01:13:28.750
or maybe it's due to
the effect of the drugs.

01:13:28.750 --> 01:13:31.060
And what that has generated
is the other thing

01:13:31.060 --> 01:13:33.860
that people in this
business kill for, which

01:13:33.860 --> 01:13:36.510
is unmedicated schizophrenics.

01:13:36.510 --> 01:13:39.520
And researchers
love these people,

01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:41.360
they can't get enough of them.

01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:43.500
This is the teenager
who is brought

01:13:43.500 --> 01:13:46.060
in for the first diagnosis.

01:13:46.060 --> 01:13:49.970
And the family is no doubt
thinking finally we're

01:13:49.970 --> 01:13:50.930
going to get some help.

01:13:50.930 --> 01:13:53.050
And all the researcher
physician there is thinking

01:13:53.050 --> 01:13:55.050
is they want to
centrifuge this kid

01:13:55.050 --> 01:13:57.550
and do research
and find that out,

01:13:57.550 --> 01:14:00.280
getting unmedicated
schizophrenics.

01:14:00.280 --> 01:14:04.270
Finally, a big boon in the
field has been brain imaging.

01:14:04.270 --> 01:14:06.980
So instead of trying to figure
out the normal size of things

01:14:06.980 --> 01:14:08.710
after you've taken
the brain out,

01:14:08.710 --> 01:14:11.390
you could image
the brain in situ,

01:14:11.390 --> 01:14:13.520
while the person is still alive.

01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:16.890
So given all of those
methodological constraints,

01:14:16.890 --> 01:14:19.830
there's a number of
things that have come up.

01:14:19.830 --> 01:14:21.450
Here's a cross-section
of the brain,

01:14:21.450 --> 01:14:24.340
although I'm realizing this is
a cross-section of a rat brain.

01:14:24.340 --> 01:14:27.220
And it also is a amusing face.

01:14:27.220 --> 01:14:29.750
And what you have
are these things

01:14:29.750 --> 01:14:32.590
that run through the brain
called the ventricles.

01:14:32.590 --> 01:14:35.600
They are these caverns
running through, filled

01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:37.540
with cerebral spinal fluid.

01:14:37.540 --> 01:14:42.890
What you see in schizophrenia is
enlargement of the ventricles.

01:14:42.890 --> 01:14:44.210
So the ventricles enlarge.

01:14:44.210 --> 01:14:46.320
The skull isn't going
anywhere, and, thus,

01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:47.990
if the ventricles
are getting bigger,

01:14:47.990 --> 01:14:50.130
something else has to
be getting smaller.

01:14:50.130 --> 01:14:54.070
There is contraction
compression of the cortex.

01:14:54.070 --> 01:14:58.040
So you get cortical
compression in schizophrenics.

01:14:58.040 --> 01:15:01.630
You get it particularly
so in the frontal cortex.

01:15:01.630 --> 01:15:04.340
A-ha, that's kind
of interesting.

01:15:04.340 --> 01:15:08.240
Meanwhile, over in the
hippocampus, what you have,

01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:12.110
normally, are these very
characteristic cell fields,

01:15:12.110 --> 01:15:14.380
where-- I just drew
them wrong, where

01:15:14.380 --> 01:15:17.160
neurons that are called
pyramidal neurons that,

01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:19.355
shockingly, are
pyramidally shaped.

01:15:20.010 --> 01:15:22.360
And what they have is
they're organized in layers.

01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:24.560
And they send all
of their projections

01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:28.670
off to the next cell layer that
happens to be diamond shaped.

01:15:28.670 --> 01:15:30.180
And that's how it works.

01:15:30.180 --> 01:15:32.910
You look in the brains of
schizophrenics post-mortem

01:15:32.910 --> 01:15:35.830
and there's fewer
hippocampal neurons.

01:15:35.830 --> 01:15:41.580
And there's some of them
are facing the wrong way.

01:15:41.580 --> 01:15:42.790
They've been flipped over.

01:15:42.790 --> 01:15:45.600
They're sending projections
where they're not supposed to.

01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:49.060
This is not going to make for
a whole lot of solid sequential

01:15:49.060 --> 01:15:51.030
thought if you've
got neurons pointing

01:15:51.030 --> 01:15:52.320
in the wrong direction.

01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:54.940
So that's popped up
in the literature.

01:15:54.940 --> 01:15:57.910
Then, of course,
frontal cortex, where

01:15:57.910 --> 01:16:02.410
what's been seen as, in
some studies, fewer neurons,

01:16:02.410 --> 01:16:05.930
in some studies, fewer
glia, in some studies,

01:16:05.930 --> 01:16:12.410
fewer of both, what you see is,
also, lower levels of a protein

01:16:12.410 --> 01:16:13.240
called reelin.

01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:18.490
And what reelin has to do
is with cortical maturation.

01:16:18.490 --> 01:16:21.120
There's lower levels of
it in the frontal cortex

01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:22.170
of schizophrenics.

01:16:22.170 --> 01:16:25.460
All of this begins to fit
in this picture of you're

01:16:25.460 --> 01:16:30.190
not getting a normal final
burst of frontal maturation

01:16:30.190 --> 01:16:32.350
late adolescence,
early adulthood.

01:16:32.350 --> 01:16:35.430
You're seeing a lot
of problems there.

01:16:35.430 --> 01:16:36.820
What else?

01:16:36.820 --> 01:16:39.430
You also see a couple
of other minor things.

01:16:39.430 --> 01:16:41.710
The thalamus tends
to be atrophied.

01:16:41.710 --> 01:16:43.640
Nobody really knows
what's going on.

01:16:43.640 --> 01:16:45.970
The sense is
hippocampus pointing

01:16:45.970 --> 01:16:48.450
in the wrong direction,
frontal cortex, that's

01:16:48.450 --> 01:16:51.800
getting compressed, because
it's got fewer neurons perhaps.

01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:55.500
This is not going to
make for a normal brain.

01:16:55.500 --> 01:17:00.110
So now switching one box
back, what about the genetics?

01:17:00.110 --> 01:17:02.212
And you'll notice this is
one of our first topics

01:17:02.212 --> 01:17:03.920
where there's nothing
been happening here

01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:07.790
in terms of endocrine effects,
acute releasers not terribly

01:17:07.790 --> 01:17:09.570
pertinent to this field.

01:17:09.570 --> 01:17:11.010
So what about genetics?

01:17:11.010 --> 01:17:14.890
Going back to all of our classic
behavior genetics approaches,

01:17:14.890 --> 01:17:17.130
this has been the
psychiatric disease

01:17:17.130 --> 01:17:18.900
where there was
the first evidence

01:17:18.900 --> 01:17:21.520
for a genetic component to it.

01:17:21.520 --> 01:17:24.990
The twin studies, the
Kety adoption studies

01:17:24.990 --> 01:17:27.850
that we've heard all about,
and what they have suggested

01:17:27.850 --> 01:17:32.090
was about 50% heritability
for schizophrenia.

01:17:32.090 --> 01:17:35.340
And you are all over now
what heritability means

01:17:35.340 --> 01:17:36.410
and what it doesn't mean.

01:17:36.410 --> 01:17:40.630
What you see within families is
if you have an individual who

01:17:40.630 --> 01:17:43.720
has schizophrenia and they
have an identical twin,

01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:47.140
the twin has a 50%
chance of the disease.

01:17:47.140 --> 01:17:50.110
If they have a full
sibling, about 25%

01:17:50.110 --> 01:17:53.710
chance of a disease,
half sibling, about 12%.

01:17:53.710 --> 01:17:57.630
Take a random person off
the street, 1% to 2%,

01:17:57.630 --> 01:18:00.970
so there is a
large genetic load.

01:18:00.970 --> 01:18:05.870
What you also see is in a
higher than expected number

01:18:05.870 --> 01:18:08.520
of close relatives
of schizophrenics

01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:11.380
are mild versions
of thought disorder.

01:18:11.380 --> 01:18:13.050
And that's going to
come in on Friday

01:18:13.050 --> 01:18:14.890
in a very interesting way.

01:18:14.890 --> 01:18:16.650
What this is saying
right off the bat,

01:18:16.650 --> 01:18:20.490
it is not saying that all
relatives of schizophrenics

01:18:20.490 --> 01:18:23.300
have these abnormalities,
but they are occurring

01:18:23.300 --> 01:18:26.000
at a higher than expected rate.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:30.030
So that's old classical
behavior genetics.

01:18:30.030 --> 01:18:33.560
Now, jumping forward a
decade's worth of technology,

01:18:33.560 --> 01:18:36.960
how about molecular approaches
the version of just getting

01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:38.530
genetic markers?

01:18:38.530 --> 01:18:41.650
Not identifying the gene itself,
but you remember this approach

01:18:41.650 --> 01:18:45.210
by now where you are
finding a stretch of DNA.

01:18:45.210 --> 01:18:47.250
And inside that
stretch is a gene

01:18:47.250 --> 01:18:49.400
that is very pertinent
to whatever it is,

01:18:49.400 --> 01:18:52.930
and the folks with the disease
have a different version

01:18:52.930 --> 01:18:53.990
than the other folks.

01:18:53.990 --> 01:18:56.760
But you don't know what
the gene is or where it is.

01:18:56.760 --> 01:19:00.950
So using this marker technique,
some of the first disease gene

01:19:00.950 --> 01:19:03.910
markers came out in the
mid '80s, late '80s,

01:19:03.910 --> 01:19:05.160
for schizophrenia.

01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:07.190
And these were landmark studies.

01:19:07.190 --> 01:19:10.340
And everybody was incredibly
excited about them.

01:19:10.340 --> 01:19:12.700
And these were really,
really important.

01:19:12.700 --> 01:19:16.200
And there was a problem,
which is somebody

01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:19.910
would isolate a marker
for schizophrenia

01:19:19.910 --> 01:19:22.320
in an Amish population.

01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:25.190
People love studying the
Amish for things like this

01:19:25.190 --> 01:19:27.380
because they've
got big families,

01:19:27.380 --> 01:19:30.080
because they don't have a
whole lot of substance abuse,

01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:32.220
because they have very
healthy lifestyles,

01:19:32.220 --> 01:19:35.800
and, most importantly,
because men, Amish men who

01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:37.990
say they are the father
of somebody or other

01:19:37.990 --> 01:19:40.360
are probably the father
of the somebody or other.

01:19:40.360 --> 01:19:43.306
There's not a lot of
messing around going on.

01:19:43.306 --> 01:19:44.430
And that's kind of helpful.

01:19:44.430 --> 01:19:46.297
You're trying to
understand genetics.

01:19:46.297 --> 01:19:48.380
And if you don't even have
the right person pegged

01:19:48.380 --> 01:19:51.010
as the father, that's going
to make for some messy data.

01:19:51.010 --> 01:19:55.840
People love the Amish, people
love inbred Icelandic fishing

01:19:55.840 --> 01:19:56.900
villages.

01:19:56.900 --> 01:19:58.670
These are all the
folks who get studied.

01:19:58.670 --> 01:20:00.460
And in those years,
out came some

01:20:00.460 --> 01:20:02.550
of the first genetic markers.

01:20:02.550 --> 01:20:05.260
And the problem was
each of the studies

01:20:05.260 --> 01:20:07.470
was getting a different marker.

01:20:07.470 --> 01:20:10.600
And nobody was coming
up with any replication,

01:20:10.600 --> 01:20:13.200
a complete
uninformative mess that

01:20:13.200 --> 01:20:16.400
was a major disappointment
in the field.

01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:20.240
So very little happened in terms
of the genetic marker approach.

01:20:20.240 --> 01:20:23.250
So we had to wait another
decade or two, and, now,

01:20:23.250 --> 01:20:25.350
our current more
modern version, which

01:20:25.350 --> 01:20:29.390
is forget a genetic marker,
what about actual genes?

01:20:29.390 --> 01:20:31.860
Are there are genes that
have been implicated

01:20:31.860 --> 01:20:35.530
in schizophrenia where
there are abnormalities,

01:20:35.530 --> 01:20:37.340
where there are variances?

01:20:37.340 --> 01:20:39.430
And then it comes from
two different flavors,

01:20:39.430 --> 01:20:41.670
eight different
flavors, our usual deal.

01:20:41.670 --> 01:20:43.450
We've already heard
about one of these,

01:20:43.450 --> 01:20:48.420
which is variance in
versions of this gene

01:20:48.420 --> 01:20:52.130
coding for this enzyme that
degrades dopamine carries

01:20:52.130 --> 01:20:55.080
an association
with schizophrenia.

01:20:55.080 --> 01:20:58.380
Nonetheless, very small effects.

01:20:58.380 --> 01:21:01.270
Interesting finding, and
this was the last year,

01:21:01.270 --> 01:21:04.620
these were three papers
back-to-back in science,

01:21:04.620 --> 01:21:07.160
from three different
groups, all of whom

01:21:07.160 --> 01:21:09.940
used a very
contemporary technique

01:21:09.940 --> 01:21:13.270
for looking for genes,
which is a snip analysis.

01:21:13.270 --> 01:21:16.330
And it's really interesting,
and not in a million years

01:21:16.330 --> 01:21:17.840
could I describe it clearly.

01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:19.830
But using this very
state of the art thing,

01:21:19.830 --> 01:21:23.160
they all had huge populations
of schizophrenics,

01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:26.300
thousands of people in
the study, great studies.

01:21:26.300 --> 01:21:28.560
And the amazing
thing is they all

01:21:28.560 --> 01:21:33.190
found genetic abnormalities,
and they all found one in common

01:21:33.190 --> 01:21:37.010
with a huge effect, which
was very, very reassuring,

01:21:37.010 --> 01:21:39.410
until you looked at
that the gene, which

01:21:39.410 --> 01:21:41.782
made no sense at all.

01:21:41.782 --> 01:21:44.940
All three of these
groups, superb scientists,

01:21:44.940 --> 01:21:47.180
reported that, in
schizophrenia, you

01:21:47.180 --> 01:21:51.300
have a higher than expected
rate of abnormalities

01:21:51.300 --> 01:21:57.700
in genes of the major
histocompatibility complex.

01:21:57.700 --> 01:21:59.210
What is that about?

01:21:59.210 --> 01:22:01.050
The human equivalent,
wait, we're

01:22:01.050 --> 01:22:03.970
back at pheromones, and
individual signatures,

01:22:03.970 --> 01:22:05.350
and the immune system.

01:22:05.350 --> 01:22:06.840
What is this about?

01:22:06.840 --> 01:22:08.570
Nobody has a clue.

01:22:08.570 --> 01:22:11.970
But a remarkable consistency
in these three studies,

01:22:11.970 --> 01:22:15.910
they all found abnormalities in
these major histocompatibility

01:22:15.910 --> 01:22:20.690
genes that have to do with cell
signatures and immune defenses,

01:22:20.690 --> 01:22:21.470
all of that.

01:22:21.470 --> 01:22:24.330
And these were big effects
in all three studies.

01:22:24.330 --> 01:22:26.490
All the studies
were done superbly.

01:22:26.490 --> 01:22:29.370
People are just beginning
to digest that one.

01:22:29.370 --> 01:22:32.350
Nobody really has
a very clear idea.

01:22:32.350 --> 01:22:35.990
Some other genes have popped
up as having mutations

01:22:35.990 --> 01:22:39.420
or a lot of variants, where
one particular variant is more

01:22:39.420 --> 01:22:40.930
associated with schizophrenia.

01:22:40.930 --> 01:22:44.490
And there's this one gene
that's been found and replicated

01:22:44.490 --> 01:22:47.110
called DISC1.

01:22:47.110 --> 01:22:49.460
So does DISC1 do?

01:22:49.460 --> 01:22:50.640
Nobody has a clue.

01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:52.900
And just showing how pathetic
this whole finding is,

01:22:52.900 --> 01:22:55.710
what does DISC,
D-I-S-C, stand for?

01:22:55.710 --> 01:22:58.820
Disrupted in schizophrenia 1.

01:22:58.820 --> 01:23:02.320
That sure tells you a lot
about what's going on.

01:23:02.320 --> 01:23:04.220
Well, what happens
in schizophrenia?

01:23:04.220 --> 01:23:06.660
You have abnormalities
in genes that

01:23:06.660 --> 01:23:08.810
are abnormal in schizophrenia.

01:23:08.810 --> 01:23:10.000
Let's party.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.680
So you got DISC1, and people
trying to figure out it's

01:23:12.680 --> 01:23:14.580
got something to do
with second messengers.

01:23:14.580 --> 01:23:15.760
Nobody really knows.

01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:17.720
There's not a whole
lot that has been

01:23:17.720 --> 01:23:20.610
happening in this field
that counts as progress,

01:23:20.610 --> 01:23:22.680
really frustrating.

01:23:22.680 --> 01:23:26.070
People still need to make
sense of this finding.

01:23:26.070 --> 01:23:29.220
One area, though, that's
getting a lot of traction

01:23:29.220 --> 01:23:33.390
in the last few years goes back
to one of our weird mutations

01:23:33.390 --> 01:23:36.090
from our macroevolution
type lectures,

01:23:36.090 --> 01:23:39.860
that business of different
numbers of copies

01:23:39.860 --> 01:23:43.490
of a gene, macro
mutations on that level,

01:23:43.490 --> 01:23:47.870
transposable events, gene
duplications, a term we

01:23:47.870 --> 01:23:52.150
got back then is
copy number variants.

01:23:52.150 --> 01:23:54.950
How many copies of
particular genes?

01:23:54.950 --> 01:23:56.510
And the one thing
that seems to be

01:23:56.510 --> 01:24:00.310
consistent is all sorts
of genes in schizophrenia

01:24:00.310 --> 01:24:04.810
are popping up with abnormal
numbers of copies of the gene

01:24:04.810 --> 01:24:07.800
rather than abnormalities
in the gene itself.

01:24:07.800 --> 01:24:09.680
So that's really exciting.

01:24:09.680 --> 01:24:12.380
What's unexciting is
nobody's replicating

01:24:12.380 --> 01:24:13.970
which the duplications are.

01:24:13.970 --> 01:24:16.810
And most of the genes, nobody
has a clue what they do.

01:24:16.810 --> 01:24:19.360
People are flailing
other than seeing

01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:22.330
there's all sorts of different
genetic abnormalities

01:24:22.330 --> 01:24:23.410
that are popping up.

01:24:23.410 --> 01:24:24.620
How can that be?

01:24:24.620 --> 01:24:27.340
How could they all be
relevant to this disease?

01:24:27.340 --> 01:24:30.180
Back one hour,
it's not a disease.

01:24:30.180 --> 01:24:32.600
It's a whole bunch of
heterogeneous ones,

01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:34.010
and there's going
to be all sorts

01:24:34.010 --> 01:24:38.000
of different genetic
components to it.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.960
Now our next box,
early experience,

01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:44.190
and what early experience
immediately translates into

01:24:44.190 --> 01:24:46.710
is parenting style.

01:24:46.710 --> 01:24:50.310
What does schizophrenia have
to do with parenting style?

01:24:50.310 --> 01:24:52.890
We will see shortly,
which is my smooth way

01:24:52.890 --> 01:24:55.830
of trying to say that I just
jumped a paragraph by accident.

01:24:55.830 --> 01:24:57.840
So, of course, of
course, where we

01:24:57.840 --> 01:25:00.320
begin is looking at the
role of early stress

01:25:00.320 --> 01:25:01.820
in life, because
that's obviously

01:25:01.820 --> 01:25:04.700
where you have to begin
discussing early experience

01:25:04.700 --> 01:25:05.610
in schizophrenia.

01:25:05.610 --> 01:25:07.760
It's that whole
stress model thing.

01:25:07.760 --> 01:25:11.130
We already heard one version
of it, the adolescent stressor,

01:25:11.130 --> 01:25:15.010
takes the kid who's just
barely holding on and dips him

01:25:15.010 --> 01:25:15.880
way down.

01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:18.400
Another version of it
that should seem plenty

01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:22.280
logical to us by
now, prenatal stress.

01:25:22.280 --> 01:25:25.630
People who were fetuses
during the Dutch Hunger Winter

01:25:25.630 --> 01:25:28.660
have a higher than expected
rate of schizophrenia.

01:25:28.660 --> 01:25:31.480
People who were fetuses
during a huge famine

01:25:31.480 --> 01:25:37.770
in China, 1959 to 1961, higher
incidence of schizophrenia.

01:25:37.770 --> 01:25:42.430
Rats, expose them prenatally
to lots of glucocorticoids,

01:25:42.430 --> 01:25:45.090
and they wind up having
elevated dopamine levels

01:25:45.090 --> 01:25:47.420
in their frontal cortex.

01:25:47.420 --> 01:25:52.540
Have mechanical trauma at birth,
birth trauma, brief hypoxia,

01:25:52.540 --> 01:25:57.660
any of those things, increased
incidence of schizophrenia.

01:25:57.660 --> 01:25:59.220
This is very interesting.

01:25:59.220 --> 01:26:02.250
Back to our business,
remember, identical twins,

01:26:02.250 --> 01:26:04.560
they can either share
one single placenta

01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:08.780
or have two of them,
monochorionic or bichorionic.

01:26:08.780 --> 01:26:12.190
Monochorionic twins are
more likely to share

01:26:12.190 --> 01:26:17.090
the trait of schizophrenia than
bichorionic identical twins.

01:26:17.090 --> 01:26:21.040
Fetal environment,
stuff's going on there.

01:26:21.040 --> 01:26:22.890
What else with that?

01:26:22.890 --> 01:26:27.310
You wind up seeing a lot of
suggestions of interactions

01:26:27.310 --> 01:26:30.020
between the
neurochemistry of stress,

01:26:30.020 --> 01:26:31.760
and some of the
abnormalities here.

01:26:31.760 --> 01:26:33.230
You know how this works.

01:26:33.230 --> 01:26:36.750
Somewhere lurking out
there is a data set

01:26:36.750 --> 01:26:38.910
that's going to wind
up looking like this,

01:26:38.910 --> 01:26:41.720
bad version of the gene,
good version of the gene,

01:26:41.720 --> 01:26:44.850
more and more stressful of
the developmental environment.

01:26:44.850 --> 01:26:47.020
It hasn't been
identified yet, but it's

01:26:47.020 --> 01:26:50.320
got to be something like that
because everything's like that.

01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:54.680
So leading us now obviously
to discussing parenting style

01:26:54.680 --> 01:26:56.310
and schizophrenia.

01:26:56.310 --> 01:26:58.490
So where does that come in?

01:26:58.490 --> 01:27:03.170
Take the best psychiatrists
in the field, the titans,

01:27:03.170 --> 01:27:06.540
the grand poobahs
in 1950, and they

01:27:06.540 --> 01:27:08.340
would know the
exact answer, which

01:27:08.340 --> 01:27:12.020
is parenting style is the
cause of schizophrenia.

01:27:12.020 --> 01:27:16.240
Abnormal parenting is the
cause of schizophrenia.

01:27:16.240 --> 01:27:19.240
And out of this, of course,
since in those days,

01:27:19.240 --> 01:27:23.440
fathers did no parenting, what
you were saying is abnormal

01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:25.970
mothering is the cause
of schizophrenia.

01:27:25.970 --> 01:27:28.980
And the great term
that was used there

01:27:28.980 --> 01:27:32.360
was schizophrenogenic
mothering, mothering style

01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:35.390
that generates schizophrenia.

01:27:35.390 --> 01:27:38.120
What was schizophrenogenic
mothering about?

01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:41.930
Well, it depends on whose
paper you're reading.

01:27:41.930 --> 01:27:44.010
But, in general,
what they tended

01:27:44.010 --> 01:27:48.790
to have were elements of
conflicting emotional messages,

01:27:48.790 --> 01:27:51.380
conflicting, a double
bind is the phrase

01:27:51.380 --> 01:27:52.830
that always ran through it.

01:27:52.830 --> 01:27:55.540
The mother gets their son
two ties for his birthday,

01:27:55.540 --> 01:27:56.720
he puts one of them on.

01:27:56.720 --> 01:27:59.053
She says what's the matter,
you don't like the other tie

01:27:59.053 --> 01:28:01.670
I got you, or, at the
more fundamental level,

01:28:01.670 --> 01:28:04.380
saying you never say you love
me, you never say you love me,

01:28:04.380 --> 01:28:05.770
you never say-- I love you.

01:28:05.770 --> 01:28:07.750
How can that mean
anything to me when I just

01:28:07.750 --> 01:28:08.970
forced you to say that?

01:28:08.970 --> 01:28:10.500
There's no winning.

01:28:10.500 --> 01:28:12.630
And, in that view,
what schizophrenia

01:28:12.630 --> 01:28:17.380
was about was raising a kid
with distorted, contradictory,

01:28:17.380 --> 01:28:21.140
fragmented emotional demands
from the schizophrenogenic

01:28:21.140 --> 01:28:25.610
mother and out
comes schizophrenia.

01:28:25.610 --> 01:28:28.880
Now, actually, by the early
'50s, people in the field

01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:32.020
were feeling far more
broad in their thinking,

01:28:32.020 --> 01:28:34.360
recognizing this
might be damaging,

01:28:34.360 --> 01:28:37.300
in fact, to women who were
the mothers of schizophrenics.

01:28:37.300 --> 01:28:39.870
And a much more
humane model came in,

01:28:39.870 --> 01:28:42.380
which was recognizing the
possibility that fathers could

01:28:42.380 --> 01:28:44.390
screw kids up in the same way.

01:28:44.390 --> 01:28:47.030
What was more broadly
called this double bind

01:28:47.030 --> 01:28:50.450
theory of schizophrenia,
it is caused by parenting.

01:28:50.450 --> 01:28:53.930
It is caused by particular
parenting style.

01:28:53.930 --> 01:28:59.350
And then, in the early '50s,
along came the very first drug

01:28:59.350 --> 01:29:01.950
for schizophrenia,
the neuroleptics,

01:29:01.950 --> 01:29:04.160
the dopamine receptor blockers.

01:29:04.160 --> 01:29:06.510
And over the course
of the next few years,

01:29:06.510 --> 01:29:09.500
90% of the hospital
beds in this country

01:29:09.500 --> 01:29:12.350
for psychiatric patients
were emptied out,

01:29:12.350 --> 01:29:14.540
the first medication
that effectively

01:29:14.540 --> 01:29:16.060
treated schizophrenia.

01:29:16.060 --> 01:29:20.080
And at that point, if one
had any sort of capacity

01:29:20.080 --> 01:29:22.660
to face reality, all
of the proponents

01:29:22.660 --> 01:29:24.930
of schizophrenogenic
mothering should

01:29:24.930 --> 01:29:27.300
have been shocked and
stopped in their feet

01:29:27.300 --> 01:29:31.630
at that point, saying, my
God, what have we done.

01:29:31.630 --> 01:29:34.250
It's a biochemical disorder.

01:29:34.250 --> 01:29:38.030
It is not a disorder of mothers
who are not competent mothers.

01:29:38.030 --> 01:29:41.930
And it is fascinating to read
in the leading psychiatry

01:29:41.930 --> 01:29:45.260
journals from that time, you
would get these editorials

01:29:45.260 --> 01:29:48.460
from grand old men
in the field, where

01:29:48.460 --> 01:29:51.660
they would be saying I have
spent my whole life researching

01:29:51.660 --> 01:29:53.420
this disease, I
have spent my life

01:29:53.420 --> 01:29:56.930
trying to fight this disease,
which is hell, which tragically

01:29:56.930 --> 01:29:58.210
destroys lives.

01:29:58.210 --> 01:30:00.690
I've been trying to
do the right thing.

01:30:00.690 --> 01:30:02.850
I have been trying
to help people.

01:30:02.850 --> 01:30:05.240
Look, what I have done instead.

01:30:05.240 --> 01:30:07.880
This realization that
ran through the community

01:30:07.880 --> 01:30:11.190
that parenting style has
nothing to do with it.

01:30:11.190 --> 01:30:14.510
And it's half a century's
worth of mothers

01:30:14.510 --> 01:30:16.180
bringing in their
late adolescents

01:30:16.180 --> 01:30:19.380
for the first diagnosis and
being told, unfortunately,

01:30:19.380 --> 01:30:21.210
it's this nightmare
of a disease.

01:30:21.210 --> 01:30:22.640
How could this have happened?

01:30:22.640 --> 01:30:23.970
Where does it come from?

01:30:23.970 --> 01:30:25.350
You caused it.

01:30:25.350 --> 01:30:27.960
You caused it with
your mothering style.

01:30:27.960 --> 01:30:31.040
Endlessly, during the period
where modern biochemistry

01:30:31.040 --> 01:30:33.720
sweeps into psychiatry,
over and over,

01:30:33.720 --> 01:30:36.510
there are cases like this,
where the whole field has

01:30:36.510 --> 01:30:39.420
to stop and say,
my God, what have

01:30:39.420 --> 01:30:42.560
we done telling
people they caused it

01:30:42.560 --> 01:30:46.590
through some parenting style,
something of that sort.

01:30:46.590 --> 01:30:48.930
It's a biochemical disorder.

01:30:48.930 --> 01:30:52.050
So this was a shocking
finding at the time

01:30:52.050 --> 01:30:54.310
and transformed
the field in terms

01:30:54.310 --> 01:30:57.440
of schizophrenogenic
mothering going down

01:30:57.440 --> 01:30:59.350
the sink at that point.

01:30:59.350 --> 01:31:01.930
Nonetheless, there is an
interesting literature

01:31:01.930 --> 01:31:05.650
showing abnormalities
or oddities

01:31:05.650 --> 01:31:08.500
in the way communication
works in the families

01:31:08.500 --> 01:31:10.350
of schizophrenics.

01:31:10.350 --> 01:31:13.980
And this is a field now that's
called communication deviance.

01:31:13.980 --> 01:31:18.410
What you see is, on the average,
among first order relatives

01:31:18.410 --> 01:31:22.330
of schizophrenics, parents,
siblings, immediate family,

01:31:22.330 --> 01:31:27.200
what you see is, on the average,
an odd communicative style.

01:31:27.200 --> 01:31:30.610
You see a very
fragmented communicating,

01:31:30.610 --> 01:31:35.810
a very telescoped terse,
broken phrase sort of style.

01:31:35.810 --> 01:31:37.910
This has been noted very often.

01:31:37.910 --> 01:31:41.310
Again, this is not what is
seen in every close relative

01:31:41.310 --> 01:31:44.780
of a schizophrenic, but
higher than an expected rate.

01:31:44.780 --> 01:31:49.220
What you also see is all sorts
of realms of, in a sense,

01:31:49.220 --> 01:31:52.120
private communication
between schizophrenics

01:31:52.120 --> 01:31:53.560
and their close families.

01:31:53.560 --> 01:31:55.980
And the way this is
shown is with things

01:31:55.980 --> 01:31:58.300
like-- this was a
classic version.

01:31:58.300 --> 01:32:01.570
You take schizophrenics
and you show them

01:32:01.570 --> 01:32:04.620
a bunch of-- no,
that's not what you do.

01:32:04.620 --> 01:32:06.590
You give them a
Rorschach print, one

01:32:06.590 --> 01:32:08.950
of those ink symmetrical
things that's just

01:32:08.950 --> 01:32:10.650
completely chaotic looking.

01:32:10.650 --> 01:32:12.860
And they look at it
for a while, and then

01:32:12.860 --> 01:32:15.410
you put it into a stack
of a dozen other ones,

01:32:15.410 --> 01:32:16.700
and you mix them up.

01:32:16.700 --> 01:32:19.910
And you give them to the
parents of the individual.

01:32:19.910 --> 01:32:23.700
And the schizophrenic
or the healthy control

01:32:23.700 --> 01:32:26.880
is now trying to describe to
the parents which one they

01:32:26.880 --> 01:32:29.610
saw, how to find the
correct one in there.

01:32:29.610 --> 01:32:32.160
Control healthy
individuals sitting

01:32:32.160 --> 01:32:35.880
there trying to explain which
Rorschach block they saw,

01:32:35.880 --> 01:32:38.250
like no accuracy whatsoever.

01:32:38.250 --> 01:32:40.200
The schizophrenic
starts saying it

01:32:40.200 --> 01:32:43.210
looks like a butterfly
with a Van Dyke beard

01:32:43.210 --> 01:32:46.180
and ears on fire, and
the parents pull out

01:32:46.180 --> 01:32:47.640
the right one instantly.

01:32:47.640 --> 01:32:49.354
It works in the
opposite direction

01:32:49.354 --> 01:32:51.270
as well, where the parents
are the ones trying

01:32:51.270 --> 01:32:52.860
to describe the Rorschach test.

01:32:52.860 --> 01:32:55.040
It only works within families.

01:32:55.040 --> 01:32:58.850
The parents of the schizophrenic
are no better at chance

01:32:58.850 --> 01:33:00.610
when doing it with
someone else's

01:33:00.610 --> 01:33:02.140
child of a schizophrenic.

01:33:02.140 --> 01:33:05.020
There seems to be this going on.

01:33:05.020 --> 01:33:07.550
Logical interpretation,
this has nothing

01:33:07.550 --> 01:33:10.060
to do with the emergence
of schizophrenia.

01:33:10.060 --> 01:33:12.150
This is an obvious compensation.

01:33:12.150 --> 01:33:14.510
You have a child, you
have a sibling who

01:33:14.510 --> 01:33:16.630
is this thought
disordered, and there's

01:33:16.630 --> 01:33:19.120
going to be a whole lot more
adventurous communication

01:33:19.120 --> 01:33:22.770
in the family to try
to compensate for it.

01:33:22.770 --> 01:33:26.040
Few other things in terms of
early experience, and this

01:33:26.040 --> 01:33:28.930
is a whole other
domain of the disease,

01:33:28.930 --> 01:33:33.620
which is being exposed to all
sorts of infectious thingies.

01:33:33.620 --> 01:33:37.250
And this is a really interesting
provocative literature

01:33:37.250 --> 01:33:38.550
floating around.

01:33:38.550 --> 01:33:41.090
There's a far higher
than expected chance

01:33:41.090 --> 01:33:44.710
rate of schizophrenics
whose mothers were exposed

01:33:44.710 --> 01:33:47.540
to a number of different
viruses in third trimester

01:33:47.540 --> 01:33:48.866
of pregnancy.

01:33:48.866 --> 01:33:52.450
Ah, some sort
perinatal stressor,

01:33:52.450 --> 01:33:55.080
pathogenic challenge
to the system.

01:33:55.080 --> 01:33:58.360
And when you look at the
genomes of schizophrenics,

01:33:58.360 --> 01:34:03.160
they have much higher than
expected rate of viral DNA

01:34:03.160 --> 01:34:06.910
that has been inserted in there,
things called retroviruses.

01:34:06.910 --> 01:34:09.930
Technical matters don't matter.

01:34:09.930 --> 01:34:13.130
The main thing is more
evidence of higher exposure

01:34:13.130 --> 01:34:17.290
to viral pathogens,
an elevated history

01:34:17.290 --> 01:34:20.660
of neonatal viral infections.

01:34:20.660 --> 01:34:23.790
And then, the
cruelest one of all,

01:34:23.790 --> 01:34:26.920
which has to do with
a protozoan parasite,

01:34:26.920 --> 01:34:30.010
not a virus or bacteria,
but this protozoa

01:34:30.010 --> 01:34:32.720
called Toxoplasma gondii.

01:34:32.720 --> 01:34:37.660
And not Gandhi in the
Gandhian sense, but probably

01:34:37.660 --> 01:34:39.870
because it's even
pronounced differently.

01:34:39.870 --> 01:34:41.462
How are you pronouncing
it these days?

01:34:41.462 --> 01:34:42.670
Gondii.

01:34:42.670 --> 01:34:43.424
Gondii.

01:34:43.424 --> 01:34:45.710
Gondii, because there's
two Is at the end,

01:34:45.710 --> 01:34:47.880
which the old Mahatma
never quite came up with.

01:34:47.880 --> 01:34:51.970
But this parasite manages to get
more Is in there than he did.

01:34:51.970 --> 01:34:56.600
So it's Toxoplasma gondii,
as everybody knows.

01:34:56.600 --> 01:35:00.140
Toxoplasma is interesting.

01:35:00.140 --> 01:35:02.490
It has this
interesting life cycle.

01:35:02.490 --> 01:35:04.730
It reproduces in
the gut of cats.

01:35:04.730 --> 01:35:08.010
It comes out in cat feces,
feces are eaten by rodents.

01:35:08.010 --> 01:35:10.886
Now in rodents, and toxo's
evolutionary challenge

01:35:10.886 --> 01:35:12.260
has been to figure
out how to get

01:35:12.260 --> 01:35:14.280
rodents inside cats stomachs.

01:35:14.280 --> 01:35:17.340
And toxo does this
amazing thing, which

01:35:17.340 --> 01:35:20.770
my lab is doing some work
on, including Patrick,

01:35:20.770 --> 01:35:24.130
and looking at the
thing that toxo does

01:35:24.130 --> 01:35:29.570
is it makes rats begin to like
the smell of cats, and to go up

01:35:29.570 --> 01:35:30.550
and check it out.

01:35:30.550 --> 01:35:33.520
And soon, you are inside
the stomach of the cat

01:35:33.520 --> 01:35:36.190
and completing
toxo's life cycle.

01:35:36.190 --> 01:35:39.320
How it does it is
incredibly interesting

01:35:39.320 --> 01:35:40.390
and slowly emerging.

01:35:40.390 --> 01:35:42.760
So what's going on
with toxo in humans,

01:35:42.760 --> 01:35:44.880
people who are
infected with toxo

01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:49.300
have a higher than expected
rate of mild neuropsychological

01:35:49.300 --> 01:35:52.690
disinhibition, a
little bit of problems

01:35:52.690 --> 01:35:55.000
with frontal
regulation of behavior,

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:59.010
higher than expected rates
of serious car accidents,

01:35:59.010 --> 01:36:02.840
higher than expected rates for
the same degree of depression,

01:36:02.840 --> 01:36:06.130
of attempting suicide, a
picture of a certain degree

01:36:06.130 --> 01:36:07.510
of impulsivity.

01:36:07.510 --> 01:36:10.980
Not big effects, but,
nonetheless, it pops up there.

01:36:10.980 --> 01:36:13.730
But parallel with
that, from day one,

01:36:13.730 --> 01:36:17.500
there's also been a literature
showing that Toxoplasma

01:36:17.500 --> 01:36:21.700
exposure increases the
risk of schizophrenia.

01:36:21.700 --> 01:36:24.800
Individuals whose mothers
were exposed to toxo

01:36:24.800 --> 01:36:27.900
during pregnancy or
looking at schizophrenics

01:36:27.900 --> 01:36:30.360
and looking in their
blood and seeing higher

01:36:30.360 --> 01:36:34.970
than anticipated levels of
antibodies against Toxoplasma,

01:36:34.970 --> 01:36:39.210
evidence of this whole world
of a connection between cats

01:36:39.210 --> 01:36:42.510
and schizophrenia,
and all sorts of hints

01:36:42.510 --> 01:36:45.370
there, very, very
slowly emerging field.

01:36:45.370 --> 01:36:48.920
It is a real finding and it
is a well-replicated one.

01:36:48.920 --> 01:36:50.560
There's some connection there.

01:36:50.560 --> 01:36:54.330
So where does these genes having
to do with immune function

01:36:54.330 --> 01:36:55.140
come in?

01:36:55.140 --> 01:36:57.530
Maybe this is
pertinent to this world

01:36:57.530 --> 01:37:02.690
of viral correlates of
schizophrenia, parasitic ones.

01:37:02.690 --> 01:37:04.520
Nobody knows.

01:37:04.520 --> 01:37:06.830
Finally, what have we got?

01:37:06.830 --> 01:37:09.380
This challenge that we're going
to have with-- when you read

01:37:09.380 --> 01:37:11.110
the depression
chapter, all of that,

01:37:11.110 --> 01:37:13.270
is how do you put
these pieces together.

01:37:13.270 --> 01:37:16.300
How do you put together
adolescent stress

01:37:16.300 --> 01:37:20.780
with prenatal viruses
with enlarged ventricles,

01:37:20.780 --> 01:37:23.910
with funny genetic
abnormalities here?

01:37:23.910 --> 01:37:26.400
There isn't a very
good integrated model

01:37:26.400 --> 01:37:29.470
at this point to how to
put the pieces together.

01:37:29.470 --> 01:37:32.550
The field has not
gotten that far.

01:37:32.550 --> 01:37:36.300
So we're talking about genetic
abnormalities, blah, blah,

01:37:36.300 --> 01:37:36.820
all of that.

01:37:36.820 --> 01:37:38.570
And thus, you
know, our final box

01:37:38.570 --> 01:37:41.490
has to be the evolution
of schizophrenia.

01:37:41.490 --> 01:37:45.180
Where did schizophrenia
evolve from?

01:37:45.180 --> 01:37:48.990
First question you would ask
is, well, do you see something

01:37:48.990 --> 01:37:51.470
like schizophrenia
in other species.

01:37:51.470 --> 01:37:53.140
And you don't.

01:37:53.140 --> 01:37:56.800
You look at complex
primates and you

01:37:56.800 --> 01:37:59.100
see things that look
like depression,

01:37:59.100 --> 01:38:02.580
you see reactive depression,
you see melancholia,

01:38:02.580 --> 01:38:05.120
you see, in some cases,
depression so severe

01:38:05.120 --> 01:38:06.530
as to prove fatal.

01:38:06.530 --> 01:38:09.720
You don't see animals
having to loose associations

01:38:09.720 --> 01:38:12.910
with proverbs, and concrete
thought, and delusions,

01:38:12.910 --> 01:38:14.200
and hallucinations.

01:38:14.200 --> 01:38:16.280
Animals that start
acting schizophrenic

01:38:16.280 --> 01:38:17.940
get eaten that evening.

01:38:17.940 --> 01:38:19.830
So there's not a
whole lot of insight

01:38:19.830 --> 01:38:21.510
from the zoological world.

01:38:21.510 --> 01:38:25.860
There's not any animal
precedents for schizophrenia.

01:38:25.860 --> 01:38:27.180
So how about in humans?

01:38:27.180 --> 01:38:29.000
How did schizophrenia evolve?

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.600
We are now back to one
of our first lectures.

01:38:31.600 --> 01:38:33.430
Why did giraffes
have long necks?

01:38:33.430 --> 01:38:35.770
Because it's a good
thing that allows

01:38:35.770 --> 01:38:37.800
them to pass on more
copies of their genes,

01:38:37.800 --> 01:38:40.010
because it's an adaptive trait.

01:38:40.010 --> 01:38:43.780
By the rules of Darwin,
schizophrenia is maladaptive.

01:38:43.780 --> 01:38:46.420
Schizophrenics have a
lower reproductive rate

01:38:46.420 --> 01:38:48.160
than their unaffected siblings.

01:38:48.160 --> 01:38:50.760
By the math, that
is thus a trait

01:38:50.760 --> 01:38:53.360
that should be being
selected against.

01:38:53.360 --> 01:38:57.905
Yet, schizophrenia persists at
this 1% to 2% in every culture

01:38:57.905 --> 01:38:58.870
out there.

01:38:58.870 --> 01:39:00.900
Historical records
indicate things

01:39:00.900 --> 01:39:03.300
that convincingly sound
like schizophrenia

01:39:03.300 --> 01:39:04.640
have been there forever.

01:39:04.640 --> 01:39:08.160
And, thus, one has to bring up
the question that always lurks

01:39:08.160 --> 01:39:11.980
in a scenario like this, which
is are there circumstances

01:39:11.980 --> 01:39:15.330
where schizophrenia is
in fact adaptive, where

01:39:15.330 --> 01:39:18.000
it is advantageous,
where it increases

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.260
one's reproductive success.

01:39:20.260 --> 01:39:23.200
The only domain where
that has had any evidence

01:39:23.200 --> 01:39:25.710
at all in the literature
is schizophrenics

01:39:25.710 --> 01:39:29.580
appear to have a lower incidence
of certain types of cancers,

01:39:29.580 --> 01:39:35.390
in particular, lung and
throat, esophageal cancers.

01:39:35.390 --> 01:39:38.400
And that's after controlling
for smoking rates, all of that.

01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:40.870
Not a big effect, but
that causes people

01:39:40.870 --> 01:39:43.250
to mumble something
about maybe schizophrenia

01:39:43.250 --> 01:39:47.260
was selected for its anti-cancer
properties in the disease,

01:39:47.260 --> 01:39:49.730
and balanced
selection, all of that.

01:39:49.730 --> 01:39:53.300
However, there is another
possible adaptive thing

01:39:53.300 --> 01:39:55.750
that's lurking around
in there, something

01:39:55.750 --> 01:39:58.180
which causes some
of these traits

01:39:58.180 --> 01:40:01.080
to not only no longer
be maladaptive,

01:40:01.080 --> 01:40:04.560
but to be wildly useful
in certain contexts

01:40:04.560 --> 01:40:05.930
of human society.

01:40:05.930 --> 01:40:09.850
And what you'll see is it's
not full-blown schizophrenia,

01:40:09.850 --> 01:40:12.020
it's the milder
versions that you

01:40:12.020 --> 01:40:13.630
see in some of the relatives.

01:40:13.630 --> 01:40:16.790
And thus, just to give you
a sense of where things

01:40:16.790 --> 01:40:20.672
are heading, we'll talk about
that on Friday in the lecture

01:40:20.672 --> 01:40:21.616
on--

01:40:21.616 --> 01:40:25.300

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:05.891
Stanford University.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:09.810
OK.

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:10.310
Good.

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:13.050
Thank you for
notching me once more.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:14.560
OK.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.920
So various organizational
things, now that

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.840
we are here in the last gasp.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.060
One thing is, make
sure you go online,

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.850
fill out the online evaluations.

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:28.440
The other various review stuff.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:33.150
The TA's are giving a review
tomorrow from dawn until 3:30.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:34.740
What time are you guys starting?

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:35.240
1:30.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.500
1:30 to 3:30.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.476
Where?

00:00:37.476 --> 00:00:38.940
321.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:39.800
321.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.020
OK.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.510
Read it on the board, unlike me.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.110
I will pick up on office
hours, then, from 3:30 to 6:00.

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.350
And operators will be
standing by overnight.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.801
But I think that's
the preparative stuff.

00:00:53.801 --> 00:00:54.300
Let's see.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.780
Before starting
this last lecture,

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.970
something that
absolutely has to be done

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.920
is to once again emphasize what
an amazing bunch of TA's you

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.315
guys lucked out in having.

00:01:05.315 --> 00:01:08.660
I've been doing this class
for hundreds of years,

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.590
and these guys are peerless.

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.100
So thank them.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.293
They have been amazing
in every regard.

00:01:15.293 --> 00:01:26.632
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:26.632 --> 00:01:34.540
[SHOUTS]

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:35.130
OK.

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.110
I guess this needs
to be notched down.

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.170
So we start off.

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:43.190
Thank you guys.

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:44.960
You really were amazing.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.600
So starting off.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.250
What's a lot of what we have
been doing for the last 30

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.210
lectures or whatever it is here?

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.880
We've often been wrestling
with a behavior occurs,

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.850
an interesting behavior,
a social behavior,

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.800
an abnormal behavior,
destructive one.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.540
A behavior occurs, and
obviously our centerpiece

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.419
throughout has been,
why did it happen?

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:11.450
And all of our buckets,
and our buckets

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.640
that we have
magically evaporated.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.670
And at the core, over and over
with the why did this happen,

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.190
is another question that
lurks through there, simply

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.910
because very often,
we are not asking

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.520
why did this behavior occur,
some human social behavior that

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.810
is completely benign, but often
some fairly disastrous ones.

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.880
Why did this behavior occur?

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.600
Very often what is
between the lines

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.280
there is, whose fault is it?

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.020
Whose fault is it that this
abnormal behavior occurred?

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.010
And where that immediately
barrels us into

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.840
is back to the frontal cortical
sections of earlier lectures,

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.340
that whole business of volition
and culpability and-- God

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.260
help me for saying
the phrase again

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.080
the first time since the first
lecture-- free will, things

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.890
of that sort.

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:02.680
Quick survey.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.200
How many of you are
finishing the class

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.230
less wedded to the
notion of free will

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.360
than when you started?

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.958
OK.

00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.380
More so?

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:14.380
No change whatsoever?

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:17.590
What did I say?

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.370
Can you repeat that?

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.870
Hands up.

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:20.530
OK.

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:21.710
So a number of you.

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:25.770
And ultimately, this
material-- no single factoid,

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:30.030
but I think all of it together--
is a hugely complicating issue

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.960
for notions of free will,
for notions of vulnerability,

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.970
for notions of
culpability, all of that

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.590
built around this question
often lurking between the lines,

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.030
which is, why did
that behavior occur?

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.760
Whose fault is it?

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.870
As a boring subset
of that one is,

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.530
why did this behavior occur?

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.990
Who is worthy of praise for it?

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:54.410
That one is ultimately equally
interesting, but probably less

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:55.700
pressing in society.

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.050
But where are these
behaviors coming from?

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:02.500
And we've gotten
really good at doing

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.160
some moderately
sophisticated things

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.880
in dealing with the answer
to a question like these.

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.960
And a great example of
that is with epilepsy.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:15.490
500 years ago, if you
had an epileptic seizure,

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:19.540
where is this behavior coming
from was absolutely clear,

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.520
which was demonic possession
of some sort or other,

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.770
a staggering,
heartbreaking literature

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.080
of the history of
treatments of epileptics

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.910
and the response to epilepsy.

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:34.980
If in the process of somebody
having a seizure 500 years ago,

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.230
they flung their arms
around and struck

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:39.380
somebody else in the
process, it would

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.010
be considered some version
of assault and battery,

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.190
in most of Western
European countries,

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.160
again, explained with
a demonic underpinning.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.520
And we're in a
different position now.

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.790
If today somebody has a
seizure and in the process,

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:56.280
they strike and break
something, they're

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.080
not to be held legally
responsible for if they

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.500
strike somebody.

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.080
That is not assault and battery.

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:08.040
It is a ludicrous idea, because
somewhere around 1900 or so,

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.740
most people in this
country got trained

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.130
with a thought,
an explanation, a

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:15.470
where did this
behavior come from that

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:19.790
is as defining of everything
that is good about our culture

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:20.490
world.

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.780
Most people got to think
the following thing.

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.840
It's not him, it's his disease.

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:32.490
And that is a huge landmark
transition from 500 years ago,

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:35.630
people being burnt at the
stake with some really

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:40.000
bad attribution given to us
having the capacity to draw

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.700
an absolute line between the
essence of who that person is

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:49.020
and the action potential storms
that happen every now and then.

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.940
It's not him, it's his disease.

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.490
We're spectacular
at doing something

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:56.370
like that with epilepsy.

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:00.700
We are lousy at doing it in
all sorts of other domains.

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:03.020
One example, schizophrenia.

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:07.600
Back to schizophrenia again, and
the abnormal behaviors of it,

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.900
and the occasional violence
associated with it, lower than

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:13.790
in non-schizophrenia people,
but the occasional violence

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:16.780
and, of course, the
classic case again,

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:20.790
that guy John Hinckley trying
to kill Reagan in the 1980s.

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:26.060
Paranoid schizophrenic,
floridly so, and that very wise

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:29.840
jury of, in retrospect, some
remarkably unsophisticated

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:33.920
people deciding, it's not
him, it's his disease,

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:36.030
and put him in a
psychiatric hospital.

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:39.600
And the apoplexy that
went through this country

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.080
in response to with
the editorials,

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.990
the senatorial
bloviating crap about,

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:49.170
he's getting away with
this, he's getting away,

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:53.520
he is responsible, showing
an utterly limited ability

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.740
for people in this country, and
some extremely powerful ones,

00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:00.410
to draw a line between the
essence of who this John

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:05.690
Hinckley is and the dopamine
abnormalities in his brain.

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:09.570
And we have trouble drawing
that line as well, doe example,

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:12.720
in the realm of
parents and teachers

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.160
and guidance
counselors making sense

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.530
of the biology of
learning disabilities,

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:22.600
the biology of dyslexias, and a
whole world of people not very

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:25.780
good yet at drawing a line
between that and the person.

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:30.700
And instead, out come concepts
like lazy and stupid and things

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:36.850
of that sort that have a
long, long well-maintained

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:39.230
in the history of
education in this country.

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:44.550
And a lot of people in positions
of power, parents et al, still

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:46.590
have not gotten
very good at drawing

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:50.100
the line between the essence
of who that person is

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:52.400
and the biological
constraints that

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:54.790
are superimposed on top of it.

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:57.540
What you begin to see after
a while is something very

00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:59.090
interesting, which
is going to be one

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:01.430
of the main points of
this last structure, which

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:04.700
is, as more and more
information in this world

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:07.960
of behavioral social
biology, whatever it is we're

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:10.910
calling this, as more and
more of this has occurred,

00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:14.440
as we get more and more domains
where we have to at least begin

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:18.200
to consider there's a line
in between the essence of

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:21.280
and the abnormalities
of-- at some point,

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:24.210
this is going to stop
being the biology of them

00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:28.280
and their disorders and is
going to be the biology of us.

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:30.910
And when things get
really close to home

00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:33.360
at that point, that's
where a lot of people

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:37.360
get very, very anxious
and very skittish about,

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.330
essentially, the
punchline from a class

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:42.490
like this, the
transition from them

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:45.850
and their existing in
a different category

00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:49.410
with a boundary, with a
bucket, versus the rest of.

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:51.690
Us as it gets closer
and closer to home,

00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:55.920
the transition from
them and disease to us

00:08:55.920 --> 00:09:00.410
and individual differences
and quirks and idiosyncrasies,

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:05.360
and a biology that is just
as much of a biology as them

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:09.150
and their diseases, where
the subtleties come in.

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:12.050
And where there has to have been
that case, sort of that sense

00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:16.230
challenging, is looking at some
of the subtle neuropsychiatric

00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:18.910
disorders that we have in
the class, a few of which

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:21.570
I'll go over again here,
but a few new ones,

00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:24.010
where over and over
it's the theme of,

00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:28.320
there's not that much
difference between me and them.

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:31.320
I imagine exactly
what the continuum is.

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:35.120
It is not clear whatsoever
where the line should be drawn,

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:38.980
the new category of
normal versus abnormal.

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:41.300
Case after case of this.

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:44.100
One obvious one most
recently emphasized,

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:47.850
schizotypalism, schizotypal
personality disorder.

00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:50.690
And when you look at
the range of symptoms,

00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:53.100
this is not a
psychiatric disorder.

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:56.110
This really is not, and
justifies the transition

00:09:56.110 --> 00:10:00.200
to schizotypal personality,
rather than a disorder.

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:04.310
It isn't a psychiatric disease
to consult astrologers.

00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:08.260
It isn't a psychiatric disease
to go to Star Trek conventions.

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:09.770
It isn't any of these things.

00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:14.820
It is one extreme in one
axis of human behavior,

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:18.100
and it is one where,
by definition, we're

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:21.850
beginning to sense the biology
of it lurking around out there.

00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:25.590
We know it's got something
to do with the same genetics

00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:29.130
that you find in the fuller
loaded version in schizophrenia

00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:29.940
itself.

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:34.650
We could begin to imagine
that this is the biology of us

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:36.870
and some of our
quirky obsessions,

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:39.960
versus them and
their schizophrenia.

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:40.990
More examples.

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:44.440
We endlessly heard about the
frontal lobe in this class,

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:47.880
and we heard about the
boring, easy examples, when

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:50.200
it is blown out
of the water, when

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:53.490
you have Phineas Gage,
when you have frontally

00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:55.770
damaged disinhibited murderers.

00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:58.930
We've heard all about those,
and those are the easy ones.

00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:02.280
Those are not so easy if the
vast majority of states in this

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:05.920
country cannot deal with the
notion at a criminal trial that

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:10.170
somebody with no frontal cortex
is not a biologically normal

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:10.800
human.

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:13.400
But nonetheless,
that's relatively easy

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:15.910
compared to the
issue that we really

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:19.280
have to think about, which is,
the person sitting next to you

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:22.080
has a different frontal
cortex than you do.

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:24.570
And you, by now,
can come up-- yes,

00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:26.210
it's the person on
the left, seeing

00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:28.180
sort of where the
eyes are shifting--

00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:31.610
and coming up with
this obvious fact

00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:33.940
that this makes a difference.

00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:37.080
This makes a difference not in
explaining why one person here

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:41.590
might be a serial murderer and
the next person not, but just,

00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:44.160
who's got it together
with the studying?

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.770
Who's going to do an
all-nighter Thursday night?

00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:49.020
Who has what sort
of personality?

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:51.580
Who is too shy to say
something or other?

00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:55.000
Who's the one who is
always the first to say--

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.760
and this world of
individual differences.

00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:01.490
And you have no shortage by
now of ways in which that

00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:03.860
may manifest itself.

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:06.260
How many neurons and
how many synapses

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.490
and what sort of
receptors and all of that?

00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:11.810
You could go on all week long
as to the possible underpinnings

00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:13.870
of that, and you
could go on all week

00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:18.490
long as to what events--
genetic, prenatal, et cetera--

00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:19.880
might have brought that about.

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:21.590
But the whole
critical thing there

00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:24.890
is the transition from
them and their brains

00:12:24.890 --> 00:12:28.690
with no frontal cortex left
to making sense of the fact

00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:32.220
that all of us with perfectly
normal frontal cortices

00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:34.780
nonetheless all
have different ones.

00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:36.800
And at some point,
this transition

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:40.450
brings the term frontal,
frontal disinhibition, out

00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:42.380
of the realm of pathology.

00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:43.910
I mean, a great
example of this--

00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:46.350
in terms of how
commonplace this now

00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:49.070
is among of biological
psychiatry types-- you'll

00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:53.660
be at some conference, and some
poor, quivering grad student

00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:55.630
gets up to give a short talk.

00:12:55.630 --> 00:12:58.330
And this is the first
talk the person ever gave,

00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:01.140
and they're obviously like
a total nervous wreck,

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:03.620
and they manage to sort
of limp through the end,

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:07.850
and they're a sopping rag at the
end there, but they've done OK.

00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:11.740
And then some total jerk
big shot in the field

00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:14.960
gets up from the back
row and savages the guy,

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:18.380
and gets him on stupid
statistics, minutiae,

00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:20.610
and chest thumps and
attacks his enemies

00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:23.790
and yells at him for not
citing, and going on and on.

00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:25.520
And somebody is
going to lean over

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:27.140
to somebody else
in the audience,

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:30.090
and referring to the
guy back, saying, jesus,

00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:32.940
he is getting more
frontal every day.

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:36.080
And that may not
just be a metaphor.

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:40.563
That may be a way of hinting at
the biology that is absolutely

00:13:40.563 --> 00:13:41.063
there.

00:13:41.063 --> 00:13:41.830
Why?

00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:44.600
Some of us do some things
like that, and some of us

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:48.640
would die rather than be that
forward or that disinhibited,

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:51.090
those individual differences.

00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:53.270
And we surely know
they are there,

00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:55.960
and we're beginning
to understand the baby

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:59.610
steps of different versions
of dopamine receptors

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:03.820
in the frontal cortex, that
whole world of transitioning

00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:06.740
from them and the front of their
head blown out of the water

00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:10.310
to us and our
individual differences.

00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:13.560
Another domain of this, another
realm of insight, and that's

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:16.020
this disease
Huntington's Disease.

00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:19.260
And you will perhaps recall
back to the very first class,

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:22.660
making reference to what turned
out to be Huntington's, what is

00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:26.160
very often the profile of
somebody with Huntington's.

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:29.030
Middle aged guy
suddenly starts behaving

00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:32.470
in some outrageous way,
disinhibited, all of that,

00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:35.850
that whole business of,
there's behavioral features

00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:36.920
to this disease.

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:39.890
Huntington's Disease is
a neurological disorder.

00:14:39.890 --> 00:14:43.510
Huntington's Chorea-- the
term chorea, choreography,

00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:46.770
body movement, Huntington's
uncontrolled writhing

00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:50.680
that eventually consumes
the entire body 24/7.

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:53.180
The person eventually,
not so long,

00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:56.750
soon, dies from choking
to death on their saliva

00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:59.170
because their muscles
aren't coordinated any more.

00:14:59.170 --> 00:15:02.750
Totally horrile
neurological disease.

00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:05.010
But what has taken
people years is

00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:08.310
to realize that that's not
what Huntington's looks like

00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:09.610
at the beginning.

00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:13.250
And instead it's the profile,
the scenario that I gave

00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:15.640
in the very first class, again.

00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:18.580
Middle aged guy, happy
marriage, in the suburbs,

00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:22.840
jobs, 2.73 kids and dogs,
all of that sort of thing.

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:26.090
And the one day he suddenly
punches somebody at work.

00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:29.920
Then the wife discovers he's
having an affair with whoever.

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:33.070
Then he gets arrested for
brawling drunkenly in a bar

00:15:33.070 --> 00:15:34.410
and he never used to drink.

00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:37.620
And then he embezzles
all the funds from work

00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:42.510
and disappears forever, until
a year or two later, when

00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:45.900
he shows up in a neurology ward
at the other end of the country

00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:47.840
because he's getting tremors.

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:49.620
And what people
have now figured out

00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:52.620
is, two or three years
before Huntington's is

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:55.200
a neurological
disorder of movement,

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:58.530
it's a psychiatric
disorder of disinhibition,

00:15:58.530 --> 00:16:00.800
and is one where
you begin to see

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:03.300
a behavioral profile like this.

00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:05.560
And what you see is,
by the time you've

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:07.400
got early stage
Huntington's patients

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:09.180
when they're
hospitalized, they are

00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:12.190
famous for coming
on to the staffers

00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:15.690
or showing up in the day room
without their pajama bottoms,

00:16:15.690 --> 00:16:18.330
or just famous for
doing stuff like that,

00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:22.040
the disinhibited behavior
of Huntington's patients.

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:24.680
And what's remarkable
there is, people have known

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:28.210
for a long time what
the neuropathology is

00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:30.980
of Huntington's, Huntington's,
the movement disorder.

00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:32.860
And it's the disintegration
of some motor

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:34.400
pathways in the brain.

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:38.060
Now that people have genetic
markers for the disease,

00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:41.690
know with some likelihood who's
going to get it when, what's

00:16:41.690 --> 00:16:45.230
become apparent now is, two or
three years before you start

00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:47.510
getting damage in
the part of the brain

00:16:47.510 --> 00:16:50.330
having to do with motor
control, you get damage

00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:52.200
in the frontal cortex.

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:55.090
Huntington's is
initially a disease

00:16:55.090 --> 00:16:58.590
of frontal cortical degradation.

00:16:58.590 --> 00:17:02.130
And what is remarkable
about that is,

00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:05.660
this is a genetic disorder
which immediately barrels us

00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:08.800
into the, this a
maladaptive trait.

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:11.210
You are dead by the
time you're 50 or so.

00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:14.020
Our usual question,
why is it evolving,

00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:16.740
why is it being maintained
in the population,

00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:21.790
seeing a theme of a hidden
benefit of Huntington's, which

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:24.970
is that disinhibited
behavior a couple

00:17:24.970 --> 00:17:28.440
of years before the
neurological symptoms do you in.

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:31.170
During that time
window, individuals

00:17:31.170 --> 00:17:35.340
with Huntington's out-reproduce
their unaffected siblings.

00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:38.940
They become, among other
things, sexually promiscuous,

00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:41.670
and they pass on more
copies of their genes.

00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:43.470
And what you suddenly
see at that point

00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:46.650
is framed from the
standpoint of arms

00:17:46.650 --> 00:17:50.020
that won't stop moving-- we're
talking neurology-- framed

00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:53.330
from the standpoint of
number of copies of genes.

00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:55.510
This is an evolutionary advance.

00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:57.540
This is something
which behaviorally

00:17:57.540 --> 00:17:59.750
increases reproductive success.

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:02.270
Onset is typically
around age 40,

00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:04.770
so catching it around that
time, which is typically

00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:07.790
around the point where
reproductive activity--

00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:09.940
reproduction goes
down in humans.

00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:12.320
So getting an extra
little blip out there

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:14.730
from the standpoint of an
evolutionary biologist,

00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:16.280
this isn't a disease.

00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:19.900
This is a great invention
where the bill happens

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:23.130
to come a while later, but
there is no free lunch.

00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:25.810
And framed that way, this
was a very different way

00:18:25.810 --> 00:18:27.220
of thinking about this disease.

00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:31.090
But what was most striking is,
when you first hear about it

00:18:31.090 --> 00:18:33.450
and somebody says,
OK, what do you

00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:36.690
think the causes of
this behavior are?

00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:38.290
What causes this?

00:18:38.290 --> 00:18:40.830
And the ones that most
readily come to mind

00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:42.840
is, the guy's a jerk.

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:44.370
The guy's having
a midlife crisis.

00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:46.750
The guy's what,
like, oh, no, it's

00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:49.095
actually a single
gene defect where

00:18:49.095 --> 00:18:51.270
there's too many glutamines.

00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:56.660
That, and it's a disease of
a single gene goes wrong,

00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:58.170
and out comes this.

00:18:58.170 --> 00:19:01.350
And we need to
consider is, there's

00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:04.570
individual variation in
aspects of that system

00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:09.410
long, far outside the range of
what would get a disease label.

00:19:09.410 --> 00:19:12.130
And it doesn't take too
much imagination, again,

00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:15.610
to translate that into why
the person sitting next to you

00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:18.910
is a little more this way
and a little less that way.

00:19:18.910 --> 00:19:22.770
Just the same challenge
for us going from them

00:19:22.770 --> 00:19:25.000
to what makes us, us.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.360
Next example.

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:29.810
Disease I've only briefly
mentioned, I think, previously.

00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:31.270
Tourette's disease.

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:32.710
Tourette's disease.

00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:34.970
Everybody knows about
Tourette's disease,

00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:36.730
which is, it's
this disease where

00:19:36.730 --> 00:19:39.226
people curse uncontrollably.

00:19:39.226 --> 00:19:40.930
Scatology.

00:19:40.930 --> 00:19:43.840
Tourette's disease,
that doesn't begin to

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:46.610
scratch the surface of
what Tourette's is about.

00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:49.640
With Tourette's, yes,
you get that scatology.

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:54.630
You also get inappropriate
gesturing, tics, facial tics,

00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:57.510
gestures of all sorts,
aggressive ones,

00:19:57.510 --> 00:20:01.720
sexually inappropriate ones,
all sorts of vocalizations,

00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:04.050
barking sounds, animal sounds.

00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:08.500
It is just a torrent of
behaviors coming out.

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:10.990
Now the critical thing when
looking at Tourette's is,

00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:13.670
this is different from
the inappropriate behavior

00:20:13.670 --> 00:20:15.530
of somebody with frontal damage.

00:20:15.530 --> 00:20:18.370
Frontal damage is
closer to home.

00:20:18.370 --> 00:20:20.910
Every single day, I
would bet all of us

00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:24.380
have thoughts that are boastful
or lustfall or petulant

00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:27.350
or whatever, where we
would die if anybody

00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:28.750
knew we were thinking that.

00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:32.350
And damage the frontal
cortex, and when you think it,

00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:33.720
you say it.

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:37.350
It is not the secret desire
of every Tourette's patient

00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:40.460
to bark like a dog and
make quacking sounds once

00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:41.890
every seven seconds.

00:20:41.890 --> 00:20:44.220
And finally, thanks to the
damage of that disease,

00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:46.150
they are disinhibited to do so.

00:20:46.150 --> 00:20:50.290
This is an astonishingly clear
example of a line between

00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:54.420
the essence of who that person
is and these weird hiccups

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:58.200
of the id that occur in the
limbic system with Tourette's.

00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:03.150
And again, in its milder
form, it's not a disease.

00:21:03.150 --> 00:21:05.650
It's individual variation.

00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:08.406
Now remarkably with
Tourette's, of course,

00:21:08.406 --> 00:21:10.030
people are beginning
to learn something

00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:11.650
about the biology of it.

00:21:11.650 --> 00:21:12.950
There's a genetic component.

00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:14.700
It's probably not that strong.

00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:17.240
Beginning to see brain
imaging correlates of it.

00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:21.880
One totally weird possible way
to wind up with Tourette's, and

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:25.150
this is a brand new class
of pediatric diseases called

00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:28.340
PANDAS, PANDAS
diseases, which stands

00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:31.900
for-- do not write this down--
which stands for Pediatric

00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:34.750
Autoimmune Neuropsychological
Disorders Associated

00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:36.600
with Streptococcus.

00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:37.710
Here's what happens.

00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:41.060
You have a three-year-old,
four-year-old kid who gets

00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:45.350
a strep infection and runs a
high fever and winds up being

00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:49.400
the one in 10,000 kids in this
situation where something goes

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:52.390
wrong, recovers from the
fever, everything is fine,

00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:56.640
and then two weeks
later explodes into tics

00:21:56.640 --> 00:22:00.860
and obsessive patterns and
Tourette's-like disinhibitions.

00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:03.490
And where did this come from?

00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:05.180
Totally paralyzing.

00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:08.200
And none of the
normal drugs work.

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:11.500
And suddenly someone
stumbles on what does work.

00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:16.100
You give the child a drug that
suppresses their immune system.

00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:17.580
Things go back to normal.

00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:20.370
Then a couple years later,
they have some other fever

00:22:20.370 --> 00:22:23.590
and they spike a high
fever, and two weeks later

00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:26.660
they explode back
into these tics,

00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:29.990
these disinhibited behaviors,
these obsessions, all of that.

00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:31.530
What's going on?

00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:34.320
What appears to be the case
is in the subset of people

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:37.810
with a high fever, these
kids, the blood brain barrier

00:22:37.810 --> 00:22:41.252
opens up in a way that
allows the immune system

00:22:41.252 --> 00:22:43.710
to get to places in the brain
where the immune system isn't

00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:44.720
supposed to be.

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:47.280
And you form
antibodies that attack

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:51.550
elements of your own brain,
of your own central nervous

00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:52.360
system.

00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:55.300
And this is what turns
out to be the case.

00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:59.110
It appears to be, in some
cases, an autoimmunie disorder,

00:22:59.110 --> 00:23:02.820
the treatment being, give the
person immune suppressants.

00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:06.910
And when you look at adults with
Tourette's disease or adults

00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:08.950
with obsessive
compulsive disorder,

00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:11.260
they have far
higher than expected

00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:15.970
at chance levels appearance of
antibodies in their bloodstream

00:23:15.970 --> 00:23:18.750
against constituents of
their nervous system.

00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:21.470
And they have a higher
than expected rate

00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:23.361
of these childhood fevers.

00:23:23.361 --> 00:23:25.360
The sort of stuff we've
been getting throughout,

00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:29.950
groping at these strange
little pieces of making sense

00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:30.880
of this stuff.

00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:34.510
And have something like that,
and you wind up with a disease

00:23:34.510 --> 00:23:37.110
that has this bizarre array
of symptoms that you see

00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:38.500
in Tourette's.

00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:42.090
And some years ago, I actually
had somebody in this class who

00:23:42.090 --> 00:23:43.046
had Tourette's.

00:23:43.046 --> 00:23:44.090
And it wasn't bad.

00:23:44.090 --> 00:23:46.410
He had like a few facial
tic sorts of things.

00:23:46.410 --> 00:23:48.110
And after the first
couple of classes,

00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:50.400
he came to office hours
and was kind of describing

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:52.460
that he had Tourette's
and he was very glad

00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:54.105
that I was familiar
with his disease,

00:23:54.105 --> 00:23:56.230
and explaining that this
was sort of something that

00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:58.610
occasionally became
disruptive in classes.

00:23:58.610 --> 00:24:00.850
And if it would be possible,
it might make sense

00:24:00.850 --> 00:24:04.500
to have an exam in a sep--
and he spent the entire time

00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:06.150
doing this.

00:24:06.150 --> 00:24:07.500
This was the disease.

00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:10.300
This was the essence
of who he was.

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:13.560
And you could not ask
for a clearer line.

00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:14.710
Look at this.

00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:17.320
500 years ago you have
Tourette's disease.

00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:20.350
It tends to have an adolescent
onset of the symptoms.

00:24:20.350 --> 00:24:23.730
It's got somewhat of a
bias female to male ratio.

00:24:23.730 --> 00:24:27.680
And certainly you've got a
13-year-old girl who suddenly

00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:32.280
starts cursing uncontrollably
with bizarre sexual references

00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:32.980
or whatever.

00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:35.790
And what's the only
possible conclusion?

00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:38.090
You've got someone
possessed by the devil

00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:40.420
who should be treated
appropriately.

00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:43.740
Look at where we've
gotten to in 500 years.

00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:45.610
We've gone from taking
people like that

00:24:45.610 --> 00:24:48.100
and burning them at the
stake to letting them take

00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:50.120
the MCATs in a different
room from everyone

00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:52.930
else so they don't disturb
them with the barking.

00:24:52.930 --> 00:24:55.520
We've gotten real good, with
a disease like Tourette's,

00:24:55.520 --> 00:25:01.640
of drawing the line over the
disease and who the person is.

00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:04.840
That's a realm where we've
gotten a lot of progress.

00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:08.010
More of these subtleties,
again, what in some ways

00:25:08.010 --> 00:25:11.270
was one of the most challenging
pieces of the religion lecture,

00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:13.650
making sense of
have a brain that

00:25:13.650 --> 00:25:17.690
has uncontrolled epileptic
firing for a couple of minutes

00:25:17.690 --> 00:25:20.710
once every six months, and
you're much more interested

00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:24.730
in the philosophy of religion,
the temporal personality

00:25:24.730 --> 00:25:25.490
business.

00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:28.460
And again, that
challenge of, most of us

00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:30.410
have gotten to our
religious stances

00:25:30.410 --> 00:25:34.010
through a great deal of
hard work and introspection.

00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:37.590
And, even if only once in
the history of the universe,

00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:39.660
somebody instead
has gotten there

00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:42.780
because their neurons
have synchronized firing

00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:45.380
in their limbic systems
once every six months,

00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:49.270
that is very challenging to
the sense of no longer talking

00:25:49.270 --> 00:25:51.730
about them, and very
challenging to the sense

00:25:51.730 --> 00:25:56.370
of making sense of us as
autonomous individuals

00:25:56.370 --> 00:25:59.040
within our own control.

00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:00.590
Other realms of this.

00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:01.870
OCD.

00:26:01.870 --> 00:26:04.660
Again, we've got some sense,
after the last lecture,

00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:06.590
of what it looks
like and just how

00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:12.330
incredibly, incredibly crippling
it is in its extreme forms.

00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:14.970
These people cannot
leave their homes.

00:26:14.970 --> 00:26:16.740
These people cannot function.

00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:19.270
They most certainly
cannot hold down jobs.

00:26:19.270 --> 00:26:23.410
It is just as destructive of
a disease, in its worst forms,

00:26:23.410 --> 00:26:25.450
as is schizophrenia.

00:26:25.450 --> 00:26:27.900
And people are beginning
to learn something

00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:30.480
about the biology
of it, that link

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:33.660
to childhood high fevers
and strep infection.

00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:36.480
Some evidence of
genetic component to it.

00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:38.960
There is first
neuroimaging being done.

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:42.880
And you might remember that area
of the brain, basal ganglia.

00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:43.550
Or maybe not.

00:26:43.550 --> 00:26:45.630
Have I actually
mentioned basal ganglia,

00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:47.050
or have I just wished to?

00:26:47.050 --> 00:26:47.550
OK.

00:26:47.550 --> 00:26:48.460
Basal ganglia.

00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:49.300
Motor area.

00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:52.530
What people are beginning
to see is, in OCD,

00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:54.370
put someone in a
scanner, and there

00:26:54.370 --> 00:26:57.810
is increased metabolic
rate in the basal ganglia,

00:26:57.810 --> 00:27:01.060
this part of the brain
involved in movement,

00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:04.690
involved in making sense
of the compulsions,

00:27:04.690 --> 00:27:08.010
the need to tap a certain
number of times, the need

00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:11.810
to arrange the utensils so that
they are perfectly parallel.

00:27:11.810 --> 00:27:15.840
The need to-- it's like there's
an itch in the motoric systems

00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:16.670
there.

00:27:16.670 --> 00:27:19.740
And people are beginning
to understand that one.

00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:22.890
Take somebody with OCD and
treat them successfully.

00:27:22.890 --> 00:27:26.850
It's typically with SSRI's,
serotonin uptake inhibitors,

00:27:26.850 --> 00:27:29.380
which also work for
aspects of depression.

00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:32.300
Treat someone effectively,
and the metabolic rate

00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:35.720
in the basal ganglia
goes back down to normal.

00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:38.890
The pieces begin to fit there.

00:27:38.890 --> 00:27:41.210
Getting into even
stranger realms--

00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:44.290
because these diseases, by
now, have mostly even passed

00:27:44.290 --> 00:27:46.720
the disease of the
month TV special,

00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:48.680
they are becoming to
be understood so well.

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:50.710
Then there's a whole
world out there

00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:54.920
of the most bizarre possible
diseases you can imagine.

00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:57.070
Here's one of my favorite ones.

00:27:57.070 --> 00:27:59.590
It's called Jerusalem Syndrome.

00:27:59.590 --> 00:28:01.020
This one is great.

00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:03.440
This is such a bizarre disease.

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:05.280
Jerusalem Syndrome.

00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:08.370
Shockingly, you can only get
through Jerusalem Syndrome

00:28:08.370 --> 00:28:10.030
in Jerusalem.

00:28:10.030 --> 00:28:10.880
Here's what you get.

00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:12.088
It's gotten to be a rule-out.

00:28:12.088 --> 00:28:15.630
The person who gets it cannot
have problems with depression

00:28:15.630 --> 00:28:16.770
or anxiety.

00:28:16.770 --> 00:28:19.390
Rule out all the other
psychiatric disorders.

00:28:19.390 --> 00:28:21.530
It's a standalone diagnosis.

00:28:21.530 --> 00:28:26.200
Here's the sort of person
who gets Jerusalem Syndrome.

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:29.480
An American, highly
religious Southern Baptist

00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:33.100
on their first trip
ever to the Holy Land.

00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:35.140
Two other requirements
that virtually

00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:36.660
are in every single case.

00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:40.150
The person has to be
relatively on their own.

00:28:40.150 --> 00:28:42.680
At the end of the day, they
are in a room by themselves,

00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:46.240
and they have to be having
huge problems with the jet lag.

00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:48.190
In other words,
they're up at all sorts

00:28:48.190 --> 00:28:50.650
of weird times of
day, and really

00:28:50.650 --> 00:28:52.570
in soggy shape because of that.

00:28:52.570 --> 00:28:54.020
Here's what happens.

00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:57.010
This is the person who's been
waiting their entire life

00:28:57.010 --> 00:28:59.710
to finally come to the
Holy Land, has been saving,

00:28:59.710 --> 00:29:00.610
has been whatever.

00:29:00.610 --> 00:29:01.760
They scrape together.

00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:02.840
They go there.

00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:05.300
This will be the land
where Christ walked.

00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:07.870
And they get there and
they see that Jerusalem

00:29:07.870 --> 00:29:09.660
is like a normal city.

00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:12.760
There's traffic jams,
there's smog, there's noise,

00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:14.850
there's pickpockets,
there's McDonald's.

00:29:14.850 --> 00:29:18.390
There's all of that, and
they're disappointed.

00:29:18.390 --> 00:29:21.130
They are shattered by this.

00:29:21.130 --> 00:29:24.730
And something comes
unhinged, and something

00:29:24.730 --> 00:29:27.045
comes unhinged in the
middle of the night there.

00:29:27.045 --> 00:29:29.170
They're not being able to
sleep alone in that room,

00:29:29.170 --> 00:29:32.110
dealing with this
shocking realization

00:29:32.110 --> 00:29:34.390
that the place they had
dreamt of their entire life

00:29:34.390 --> 00:29:35.630
doesn't exist anymore.

00:29:35.630 --> 00:29:37.640
And something cracks.

00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:38.980
Here's the detail that I love.

00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:40.710
In every single
one of these cases,

00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:44.560
the person rips apart
the hotel room bed,

00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:49.890
shreds the-- not the mattress,
the sheet-- shreds the sheet,

00:29:49.890 --> 00:29:52.160
takes their clothes off,
and before you know it,

00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:54.070
they're on a street
corner in Jerusalem

00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:56.500
dressed in a toga
preaching to everyone,

00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:59.300
telling them to go
back to simpler ways.

00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:02.120
The psychiatry SWAT
team from the hospital

00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:04.014
there shows up,
takes the person,

00:30:04.014 --> 00:30:06.430
puts him in the hospital there
for a couple of days or so.

00:30:06.430 --> 00:30:07.460
Their head clears.

00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:09.676
Ships them back to
Biloxi or wherever,

00:30:09.676 --> 00:30:11.300
and they never have
a problem with this

00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:12.690
again for the rest
of their life.

00:30:12.690 --> 00:30:16.980
They get 50 cases of
this a year in Jerusalem.

00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:18.880
This is a recognized syndrome.

00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:22.760
People publish papers
about Jerusalem Syndrome.

00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:24.670
It struck me, though,
that there is actually

00:30:24.670 --> 00:30:27.030
a very easy cure for it,
which is, in Jerusalem, in all

00:30:27.030 --> 00:30:30.250
the hotel rooms, if the sheets
always were plaid or something.

00:30:30.250 --> 00:30:33.420
Something about the white just
begs to be pulled into a toga,

00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:35.440
and that sort of pushes
them over the edge.

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:37.770
But this is a real disease.

00:30:37.770 --> 00:30:39.170
More of these.

00:30:39.170 --> 00:30:40.620
Stendhal's disease.

00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:43.580
Stendhal disease you can
only get in its official

00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:45.530
form in the city of Florence.

00:30:45.530 --> 00:30:47.840
And Stendhal, the
well-known-- what

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:52.100
was he, a philosopher or
writer or hockey player?

00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:53.260
Writer.

00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:55.290
Yes, the well-known writer,
thank you, Stendhal,

00:30:55.290 --> 00:30:59.740
who, describing the first
time he came to Florence,

00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:03.080
and this sense of
vertigo and nausea

00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:05.200
and complete loss
of control that

00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:10.170
came from seeing one too many
amazing, priceless, unmatchable

00:31:10.170 --> 00:31:13.680
frescoes, where you get
into a manic state from it

00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:15.070
and you can't take it anymore.

00:31:15.070 --> 00:31:18.020
And you come out
running like a wild boar

00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:19.770
through the streets of Florence.

00:31:19.770 --> 00:31:22.360
This occurs with some
regularity there,

00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:24.920
and this is termed
Stendhal Syndrome.

00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:28.130
There are papers written
about the subject.

00:31:28.130 --> 00:31:28.970
More of these.

00:31:28.970 --> 00:31:34.500
Then there is a disease
which, trichotillomania--

00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:36.630
these
impossible-to-pronounce ones,

00:31:36.630 --> 00:31:42.400
people who eat hair, people
who eat hair obsessively.

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:44.397
Not just the anxious
version, sometimes,

00:31:44.397 --> 00:31:46.980
of somebody who's kind of like
chewing their hair when they're

00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:48.190
sort of anxious.

00:31:48.190 --> 00:31:52.850
But instead this is where a
person is pulling hair off

00:31:52.850 --> 00:31:55.070
of their brush in
order to eat it.

00:31:55.070 --> 00:31:58.320
They go over to someone's house
and they go to the bathroom

00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:01.270
and open up and find the
brushes and the combs

00:32:01.270 --> 00:32:03.240
there to pull the hair off.

00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:08.490
This is an incredibly disturbed
disease, where at an extreme,

00:32:08.490 --> 00:32:12.150
you get somebody who has
consumed so much hair that it

00:32:12.150 --> 00:32:13.910
forms a hairball.

00:32:13.910 --> 00:32:17.650
It blocks their stomach, and
this is life-threatening.

00:32:17.650 --> 00:32:20.610
It forms a plug of
hair with a long strand

00:32:20.610 --> 00:32:23.380
of it coming up the esophagus.

00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:25.600
And this is life-threatening.

00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:28.752
And you have to take
it out surgically.

00:32:28.752 --> 00:32:31.750
And it's this whole clot of
hair with this thing that

00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:33.390
was going up in the esophagus.

00:32:33.390 --> 00:32:35.650
And what is this disease called?

00:32:35.650 --> 00:32:39.050
It's called Rapunzel's
Syndrome because

00:32:39.050 --> 00:32:40.790
of the long stretch of hair.

00:32:40.790 --> 00:32:43.260
How weird is that?

00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:44.640
What is that about?

00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:47.070
Just imagine we start with
one of our charts here,

00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:50.960
and we say, steals hair from
friends' bathroom brushes,

00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:54.310
and sort of say, try to do
that one of working our way

00:32:54.310 --> 00:32:56.770
backwards of what happened
the second before,

00:32:56.770 --> 00:32:58.620
to evolution of whatever.

00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:00.500
How bizarre is that?

00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:04.700
That's like nothing compared
to the next two diseases,

00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:07.380
that are so hard to
pronounce I'm not even

00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:09.950
going to attempt to.

00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:12.290
Actually the first disease
is pretty run of the mill

00:33:12.290 --> 00:33:13.530
and pretty straightforward.

00:33:13.530 --> 00:33:15.980
The first of these
is merely the disease

00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:21.944
of people who can only become
sexually aroused by amputees.

00:33:21.944 --> 00:33:22.810
Whoah.

00:33:22.810 --> 00:33:23.710
OK.

00:33:23.710 --> 00:33:25.380
That's a little bit peculiar.

00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:28.200
That makes like the person
with it seem like the kid

00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:30.590
next door compared to this one.

00:33:30.590 --> 00:33:32.710
This is the disease
of someone who

00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:35.610
has a body dimorphism image.

00:33:35.610 --> 00:33:38.800
It's a body
integrative disorder.

00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:41.170
This is someone who,
their entire life,

00:33:41.170 --> 00:33:45.260
has believed they are meant
to have a limb missing.

00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:49.410
Their sense of themselves
involve them being an amputee.

00:33:49.410 --> 00:33:51.320
This is a real disease.

00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:54.840
This is a real disease
where people have websites

00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:57.410
where they communicate
with each other about how

00:33:57.410 --> 00:34:00.200
to have industrial
accidents, accidents

00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:03.780
that will remove a limb, where
it will look like an accident.

00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:06.720
There are secret physicians
who will do this.

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:09.480
There was a paper in
a neuroethics journal

00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:12.270
a couple of years ago
by a physician arguing

00:34:12.270 --> 00:34:14.400
that one should be
willing to carry out

00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:16.929
the surgery on a person
who wants this done,

00:34:16.929 --> 00:34:20.159
because they will find a way to
do it disastrously otherwise.

00:34:20.159 --> 00:34:22.880
As termed by the person
who first described it,

00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:25.980
this is a new way of being mad.

00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:30.190
And this is terrain
like you cannot imagine.

00:34:30.190 --> 00:34:32.710
Finally, most
shocking of all, this

00:34:32.710 --> 00:34:35.480
was a case report a couple
years ago of somebody

00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:37.850
who had stroke damage
to the cortical area

00:34:37.850 --> 00:34:40.560
towards the frontal cortex,
but also a little bit in one

00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:41.350
other area.

00:34:41.350 --> 00:34:43.469
And as the case
report described,

00:34:43.469 --> 00:34:45.960
this person, in the
aftermath, became

00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:49.409
obsessed with polka music.

00:34:49.409 --> 00:34:50.219
Polka music.

00:34:50.219 --> 00:34:53.510
This was like some gang
member Hell's Angel guy

00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:56.670
who had, like, brain damage
after one brawl too many.

00:34:56.670 --> 00:34:58.710
And out the other
end, this is someone

00:34:58.710 --> 00:35:02.170
who's willing to slash you to
bits if you disagree with which

00:35:02.170 --> 00:35:05.440
is the best polka group coming
out of Krakow these days,

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:06.290
or some such thing.

00:35:06.290 --> 00:35:11.420
The person spent a dozen hours
a day listening to polka music.

00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:13.500
What the hell is with that?

00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:14.000
what?

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:15.000
Damage there?

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.440
We're just seeing these
totally bizarre ways

00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:20.720
in which things can go wrong.

00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:23.790
Things can go wrong in
merely peculiar ways.

00:35:23.790 --> 00:35:28.310
Things can go wrong in ways
that destroy people's lives.

00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:30.480
So what are we to make
of things like this?

00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:33.990
This whole world of these subtle
neuropsychiatric disorders

00:35:33.990 --> 00:35:36.390
where, with each one of
them, it's easier and easier

00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:39.400
to imagine how it
translates into not them

00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:43.240
and their disease, but our
individual differences.

00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:45.950
One thing to appreciate
is that the majority

00:35:45.950 --> 00:35:48.600
of these that fall in
this category, they

00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:51.660
didn't even have
names 50 years ago.

00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:55.510
There wasn't a way of
describing, or even imagining,

00:35:55.510 --> 00:35:59.160
that biology could go wrong
in this particular way.

00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:01.220
And there weren't
even names for those.

00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:03.750
Most of these didn't
have names 10 years ago.

00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:05.730
And what's obvious
then is, there's

00:36:05.730 --> 00:36:08.180
no way the science
is going to stop.

00:36:08.180 --> 00:36:10.010
Just more and more
of these names

00:36:10.010 --> 00:36:13.060
are going to appear, more
and more of these syndromes

00:36:13.060 --> 00:36:14.050
and disorders.

00:36:14.050 --> 00:36:16.540
And at some point,
every single one of us

00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:19.250
is going to have two or
three of those labels.

00:36:19.250 --> 00:36:22.100
And what happens at
that point, because this

00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:25.090
is describing a
very close array of

00:36:25.090 --> 00:36:27.800
human individual variability.

00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:29.510
I do not have OCD.

00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:31.730
But I will count
stairs on occasion.

00:36:31.730 --> 00:36:35.360
I, during periods of
anxiety, will do that.

00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:38.610
Obviously I have only
one clothing style

00:36:38.610 --> 00:36:40.640
for the last 10 weeks.

00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:43.390
Every day, coming here, I
go through the same sort

00:36:43.390 --> 00:36:45.630
of rehearsal saying,
I am not going

00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:49.100
to start off the lecture today
by saying, OK, let's get going.

00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:51.270
And then I've done it again.

00:36:51.270 --> 00:36:53.500
And I don't have OCD.

00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:56.575
I have that weird, weird
compulsive behavior,

00:36:56.575 --> 00:36:58.250
or ritualistic ones.

00:36:58.250 --> 00:36:58.990
Obsessional.

00:36:58.990 --> 00:36:59.490
OK.

00:36:59.490 --> 00:37:02.470
Here's what I've been wasting
most of today thinking about.

00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:04.259
I have a grant due
next week, and I'm

00:37:04.259 --> 00:37:05.800
getting so little
done on it that I'm

00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:06.841
beginning to get anxious.

00:37:06.841 --> 00:37:09.430
So I've been having
this whole repeated

00:37:09.430 --> 00:37:16.190
pattern of this intrusive force
thinking about, Charlie Bit Me.

00:37:16.190 --> 00:37:18.970
So I think about Charlie Bit Me.

00:37:18.970 --> 00:37:21.550
Then I think, this
can't be for real.

00:37:21.550 --> 00:37:23.650
They had to have had
professional actors.

00:37:23.650 --> 00:37:25.666
Then I think,
that's not possible.

00:37:25.666 --> 00:37:27.040
There's no way
you can get a baby

00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:29.030
to bite the finger that way.

00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:31.420
Then I think, if this
was actually staged,

00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:34.320
I am deeply hurt by
the YouTube people.

00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:36.550
Then I think about
how his accent

00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:38.510
sounds when he says Charlie.

00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:40.500
Then I realize I'm
moving my lips.

00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:42.750
Then I say, OK, you
got a grant due.

00:37:42.750 --> 00:37:44.520
Stop screwing around already.

00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:46.760
Whoah, Charlie Bit Me.

00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:48.070
What a cool video.

00:37:48.070 --> 00:37:50.040
I wonder if they staged it.

00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:52.570
This has been going
on for all of today.

00:37:52.570 --> 00:37:57.060
This is not OCD, but
it's elements of.

00:37:57.060 --> 00:37:59.180
And just as every one
of us has elements

00:37:59.180 --> 00:38:02.200
of some of these, where all of
these individual differences

00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:02.950
come in.

00:38:02.950 --> 00:38:05.850
And at some point we will
have to deal with the fact

00:38:05.850 --> 00:38:09.280
that the same exact
biology, writ large, that

00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:13.090
may make somebody a
schizophrenic in a milder form,

00:38:13.090 --> 00:38:14.890
will have them being
very interested

00:38:14.890 --> 00:38:18.560
in metamagical issues, and
in the mildest form allows

00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:21.080
you to have a fantasy
while standing on line

00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:22.400
in the supermarket.

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:25.880
It's the same biology
on the same continuum.

00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:30.130
And somewhere in there it stops
being them and their diseases

00:38:30.130 --> 00:38:33.100
and becomes us and who we are.

00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:34.930
So one of the
challenges with that

00:38:34.930 --> 00:38:37.260
is, what's going
to happen as we get

00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:40.100
more and more of these
names that describes us more

00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:42.940
and more, and we understand
the neurotransmitters

00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:45.830
and the early experience and
the genes and all the last 10

00:38:45.830 --> 00:38:46.330
weeks.

00:38:46.330 --> 00:38:48.440
And as we understand
more and more of that,

00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:51.380
something often
happens at that point,

00:38:51.380 --> 00:38:56.850
which is, people begin to get
real uncomfortable, real sense

00:38:56.850 --> 00:38:58.410
of being threatened.

00:38:58.410 --> 00:39:01.260
For this tremendous
fear that what

00:39:01.260 --> 00:39:05.770
if those scientists accidentally
go and explain everything

00:39:05.770 --> 00:39:09.790
when we're beginning to
see biologies of tastes

00:39:09.790 --> 00:39:12.720
and religion and who
likes risk and who

00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:15.560
is capable of being
faithful and who is not,

00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:18.610
and who has-- and this realm
with individual differences,

00:39:18.610 --> 00:39:21.680
and begin to see the
machinery underneath.

00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:24.970
Lots of people get
uncomfortable at that point,

00:39:24.970 --> 00:39:29.910
because it challenges one of
the pretenses that we all,

00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:32.210
virtually all,
desperately cherish,

00:39:32.210 --> 00:39:35.870
which is the notion that we
are utterly, utterly unique,

00:39:35.870 --> 00:39:40.480
that each one of us is this
flame of individuality that

00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:44.290
cannot be captured, that
cannot be constrained,

00:39:44.290 --> 00:39:48.260
that defines us, this
individuality that is just

00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:49.350
bubbling away there.

00:39:49.350 --> 00:39:52.110
And there go those scientists
learning more and more

00:39:52.110 --> 00:39:53.516
about less and less.

00:39:53.516 --> 00:39:55.850
And they may mess that up.

00:39:55.850 --> 00:40:00.230
They may wipe out that
sense of our uniqueness.

00:40:00.230 --> 00:40:02.860
And that worry was
perfectly encapsulated.

00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:05.030
This famous story,
science fiction story,

00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:08.530
by Arthur C. Clarke called
The Nine Billion Names of God.

00:40:08.530 --> 00:40:11.250
Wonderful metaphor for this.

00:40:11.250 --> 00:40:13.230
This is a bunch
of Tibetan monks,

00:40:13.230 --> 00:40:16.560
and apparently in some
branch of Tibetan Buddhism,

00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:19.400
there is a belief that God
has nine billion names,

00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:23.920
an obvious metaphor for the
unknowable, the unattainable.

00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:26.330
And in this story,
these monks team up

00:40:26.330 --> 00:40:28.420
with a bunch of
computer scientists

00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:30.440
with the greatest
computer around that

00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:35.100
they program to start
printing out the names of God.

00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:38.380
And what happens in the story
is, as it's cranking through

00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:41.530
and it is going to name the
nine billion names of God,

00:40:41.530 --> 00:40:45.110
as it cranks through this,
as each new name comes out,

00:40:45.110 --> 00:40:48.680
one of the stars in
the sky goes dark.

00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:52.960
And that's a perfect metaphor
for this fear that people have,

00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:56.790
which is, if inadvertently
scientists go and learn

00:40:56.790 --> 00:41:00.900
everything with each new
soulless factoid that turns us

00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:05.390
just into a bunch of equations
or biochemical pathways,

00:41:05.390 --> 00:41:09.150
that with each new factoid,
one of the stars in the sky

00:41:09.150 --> 00:41:12.400
will go dark as we lose
some of our individuality,

00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:15.780
as we lose some of what
makes us who we are.

00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:18.540
There is no reason
to worry about this,

00:41:18.540 --> 00:41:20.540
and this is for two reasons.

00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:24.260
First off, even if scientists
went and inadvertently

00:41:24.260 --> 00:41:27.260
explained everything,
that still would not

00:41:27.260 --> 00:41:29.010
take away the wonder of it.

00:41:29.010 --> 00:41:31.890
You can take a gazelle
leaping and turn it

00:41:31.890 --> 00:41:34.960
into a whole bunch of
biomechanical equations.

00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:37.780
You could turn Bach
into Kontrapunkt Rules,

00:41:37.780 --> 00:41:40.150
and that does not in
the slightest change,

00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:43.340
or should not in the
slightest change, our capacity

00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:46.050
to be moved intensely by them.

00:41:46.050 --> 00:41:49.660
And there's no reason why
something should lose its power

00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:53.310
simply because it turns out to
have layers of complexity that

00:41:53.310 --> 00:41:57.460
were not initially available
to us, which we slowly attain.

00:41:57.460 --> 00:42:01.260
It should not destroy that
sense in the slightest.

00:42:01.260 --> 00:42:03.670
The second reason why this
isn't something to worry about

00:42:03.670 --> 00:42:07.160
is, scientists are never going
to inadvertently go and explain

00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:09.610
everything about
everything, because we've

00:42:09.610 --> 00:42:11.440
seen throughout the
class over and over

00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:14.520
and over again, every time
one question gets answered,

00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:16.920
10 more get generated,
half a dozen

00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:18.580
of which are much
more interesting

00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:20.630
questions than you
started off with.

00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:22.640
It is a fractal.

00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:26.520
It is an infinite fractal
of knowledge to be attained.

00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:28.710
They're never going to go
and inadvertently explain

00:42:28.710 --> 00:42:29.410
everything.

00:42:29.410 --> 00:42:31.610
Wonderful quote
from the geneticist

00:42:31.610 --> 00:42:34.160
Haldane-- he's the one who
came up with two brothers

00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:36.270
are eight cousinss--
another one of these,

00:42:36.270 --> 00:42:40.910
where he once said, "Life is not
only stranger than we imagine.

00:42:40.910 --> 00:42:43.920
Life is stranger
than we can imagine."

00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:47.530
Scientists are never going to
inadvertently go and explain

00:42:47.530 --> 00:42:48.410
everything.

00:42:48.410 --> 00:42:52.190
The purpose of science is not to
cure us of a sense of mystery.

00:42:52.190 --> 00:42:55.860
The purpose of science is
to constantly reinvent it.

00:42:55.860 --> 00:42:58.780
So that's one realm in
which people are threatened

00:42:58.780 --> 00:43:01.300
by all the sorts of
knowledge and where

00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:04.900
this is going in terms of
describing the what makes us

00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:06.120
who we are.

00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:07.670
There is another
realm, not just the,

00:43:07.670 --> 00:43:10.870
what happens to our sense of
selfness, another realm of,

00:43:10.870 --> 00:43:12.660
what does society do with this?

00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:16.490
What does society do as we get
more and more of these terms

00:43:16.490 --> 00:43:19.570
and we understand more and
more where the gears are,

00:43:19.570 --> 00:43:22.700
where the controls are,
where the challenges are

00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:25.620
to the sense of autonomy
and agency in people?

00:43:25.620 --> 00:43:27.890
What's going to
happen at that point?

00:43:27.890 --> 00:43:31.790
What's clear is, if you are
poor or poorly connected,

00:43:31.790 --> 00:43:34.920
you are screwed, because as
more and more of these labels

00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:37.420
are given out, that's
just the excuse that's

00:43:37.420 --> 00:43:42.580
needed to deny you a job or
health care or fair housing.

00:43:42.580 --> 00:43:47.340
That is clearly an enormous
danger with knowledge of this.

00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:49.990
But hopefully what
happens instead,

00:43:49.990 --> 00:43:54.750
on a more optimistic note, is
somewhere in all these continua

00:43:54.750 --> 00:43:58.000
that this class was
about, you see, there

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:01.140
but for the grace of God, and
a couple of neurotransmitters

00:44:01.140 --> 00:44:04.450
and three or four more
receptors, could go I,

00:44:04.450 --> 00:44:07.360
as you begin to see
a continua as you

00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:11.410
begin to see all sorts of
realms that are tragically

00:44:11.410 --> 00:44:12.370
done in biology.

00:44:12.370 --> 00:44:16.090
We have no trouble looking at
a schizophrenic and seeing,

00:44:16.090 --> 00:44:18.870
this is a disease,
and this is someone

00:44:18.870 --> 00:44:22.420
who needs our care and
forgiveness and protection.

00:44:22.420 --> 00:44:25.980
And we are in a world now where
people who obsessively count

00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:28.400
numbers eight hours
a day, we will

00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:31.920
have to be able to view that
as just as much a disease that

00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:35.290
is just as much deserving
of care and protection

00:44:35.290 --> 00:44:36.390
and understanding.

00:44:36.390 --> 00:44:38.935
With any luck, what all this
knowledge is going to do

00:44:38.935 --> 00:44:42.950
is force us to extend an
umbrella of protection,

00:44:42.950 --> 00:44:45.150
a realm of empathy,
into areas we

00:44:45.150 --> 00:44:47.790
could never have
dreamt of before,

00:44:47.790 --> 00:44:49.410
but never have dreamt of.

00:44:49.410 --> 00:44:51.960
The same exact
extent that if you

00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:54.870
took the wisest,
most compassionate,

00:44:54.870 --> 00:44:59.280
most introspective person
on earth from 500 years ago

00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:01.800
and told them
epilepsy is a disease,

00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:03.940
it would have made
no sense at all.

00:45:03.940 --> 00:45:05.450
And we are certainly
sitting here

00:45:05.450 --> 00:45:07.480
with a whole world
of things where

00:45:07.480 --> 00:45:10.530
it could make no sense to us
at all, where we will come

00:45:10.530 --> 00:45:13.960
to see that it has biological
components as strongly as any

00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:14.900
of these others.

00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:17.940
And we will have this
challenge of seeing

00:45:17.940 --> 00:45:21.750
that this is a realm not of
judgement, but of protection.

00:45:21.750 --> 00:45:23.720
And when we reach
that point, we will

00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:26.430
have discovered that
when we describe somebody

00:45:26.430 --> 00:45:29.740
as being healthy, when we say we
are healthy, what we are really

00:45:29.740 --> 00:45:33.420
saying is, we merely have the
same diseases that everybody

00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:34.690
else does.

00:45:34.690 --> 00:45:37.240
And with any luck,
out of this will come

00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:39.640
a great deal of compassion.

00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:40.140
OK.

00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:42.090
So that's where all
of this may play out

00:45:42.090 --> 00:45:44.460
in terms of the
challenge to people's

00:45:44.460 --> 00:45:47.060
sense of individuality,
what society

00:45:47.060 --> 00:45:49.470
should do with knowledge
like this as it emerges.

00:45:49.470 --> 00:45:51.710
What's probably
most important is

00:45:51.710 --> 00:45:55.590
what all this stuff means
in terms of impacting you

00:45:55.590 --> 00:45:58.230
and your interactions
in society,

00:45:58.230 --> 00:46:00.890
and what you will wind up doing.

00:46:00.890 --> 00:46:03.860
One of the irritating
themes, probably

00:46:03.860 --> 00:46:06.520
the most irritating concept
in this whole course,

00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:10.902
is the one of modulation,
these stupid if-then clauses,

00:46:10.902 --> 00:46:12.360
because what they
say over and over

00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:15.370
and over again is, just when
you think you've figured out

00:46:15.370 --> 00:46:19.170
what is causing behavior, oh no,
it's not actually causing it,

00:46:19.170 --> 00:46:22.130
it is amplifying the
preexisting tendency of this

00:46:22.130 --> 00:46:25.800
or damping or modulating or
imposing a contingent clause.

00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:28.254
Doesn't anything cause anything?

00:46:28.254 --> 00:46:29.920
It's like the entire
point of this class

00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:32.510
that nothing ever actually
starts a behavior.

00:46:32.510 --> 00:46:35.140
Everything is modulating, so
you could never figure out

00:46:35.140 --> 00:46:36.560
how stuff is actually working.

00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:39.940
Why does this have
to be so complicated?

00:46:39.940 --> 00:46:42.220
And one thing that
comes out of the,

00:46:42.220 --> 00:46:44.240
why does this have
to be so complicated

00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:47.640
is, why does it have to be
so difficult to do something

00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:50.200
helpful, then in
any of these realms?

00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:53.830
And I know for a fact that
a large majority of you

00:46:53.830 --> 00:46:57.340
have the desire to do that,
figuring in some of the things

00:46:57.340 --> 00:46:59.140
you want to do with
the rest of your life.

00:46:59.140 --> 00:47:01.150
And what is really
easy is to come out

00:47:01.150 --> 00:47:02.680
of a course like
this saying, it's

00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:04.720
really impossible
to change anything

00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:07.930
because it is so
incredibly complex.

00:47:07.930 --> 00:47:10.770
It is really hard
to do it because

00:47:10.770 --> 00:47:12.750
of how complicated it is.

00:47:12.750 --> 00:47:14.000
But it's not impossible.

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.330
It's really hard
to do it because it

00:47:16.330 --> 00:47:19.960
will require not only
doing vast amounts of work

00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:22.710
of collecting vast
amounts of information,

00:47:22.710 --> 00:47:25.260
but then trying to
synthesize it and trying

00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:27.900
to intuit when you should
stop paying attention

00:47:27.900 --> 00:47:30.000
to the vast amounts
of information.

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.970
It is doable, but it
will be incredibly hard,

00:47:32.970 --> 00:47:35.950
because down the line,
every time one of you guys

00:47:35.950 --> 00:47:38.140
will choose to try
to do something

00:47:38.140 --> 00:47:40.710
with a level of excellence
that comes to people here very

00:47:40.710 --> 00:47:43.660
easily, every time you
choose to do something,

00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:46.980
you are facto saying
no to 20 other things.

00:47:46.980 --> 00:47:50.000
And some of those other things
will be very, very important

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:50.920
things to you.

00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:53.620
And those are tough
choices to make.

00:47:53.620 --> 00:47:56.340
And it will be doable but
hard because something

00:47:56.340 --> 00:47:59.750
that's probably utterly
inconceivable to you guys,

00:47:59.750 --> 00:48:03.120
but which is, at some point
you're going to get tired.

00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:06.760
And it gets a lot harder
to try to turn all of this

00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:09.860
into how can you
make things better.

00:48:09.860 --> 00:48:13.340
But you guys need to do that.

00:48:13.340 --> 00:48:14.850
Here's a story.

00:48:14.850 --> 00:48:16.510
And this was about my father.

00:48:16.510 --> 00:48:19.780
My father was an architect,
an architectural historian.

00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:24.060
And part of his career he
taught in NYU, but McCarthy Era.

00:48:24.060 --> 00:48:26.460
Things didn't work out,
and he wound up teaching

00:48:26.460 --> 00:48:29.140
in this crappy little
architectural night

00:48:29.140 --> 00:48:32.690
school in Brooklyn for
years and years on end.

00:48:32.690 --> 00:48:36.900
This was as flea-bitten of a
place as you can possibly get.

00:48:36.900 --> 00:48:39.480
And every now and then I would
go to see a lecture of his.

00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:41.970
And he was a
spectacular lecturer.

00:48:41.970 --> 00:48:43.410
And he would do this thing.

00:48:43.410 --> 00:48:45.000
One of the lecturers,
he's in there

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:49.530
and he's putting up pictures of
the most beautiful, important

00:48:49.530 --> 00:48:51.380
buildings on earth,
and Versailles

00:48:51.380 --> 00:48:55.950
and the pyramids of Giza, and
this or that incredible palace,

00:48:55.950 --> 00:48:58.060
and all of that.

00:48:58.060 --> 00:49:01.040
And here's these guys sitting
in this night school who

00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:03.540
are, like, working as
draftsmen during the day,

00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:05.790
and this is really
a ragtag bunch,

00:49:05.790 --> 00:49:08.900
and putting up these pictures
of the most beautiful archi--

00:49:08.900 --> 00:49:12.130
and you know exactly what it
is to inspire these people,

00:49:12.130 --> 00:49:13.590
to move to the grid.

00:49:13.590 --> 00:49:15.470
And no, that's not
what he's doing.

00:49:15.470 --> 00:49:18.010
He's putting up these
pictures, and he's

00:49:18.010 --> 00:49:21.390
yelling at these people saying,
for too long architects have

00:49:21.390 --> 00:49:22.950
been whores of the wealthy.

00:49:22.950 --> 00:49:24.990
What they do is we
build their palaces,

00:49:24.990 --> 00:49:27.720
we build their mausoleums,
we build their forts.

00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:29.970
And there's Versailles and
there's the Giza and all.

00:49:29.970 --> 00:49:33.509
And I do not want to see you
being the whores of the wealthy

00:49:33.509 --> 00:49:34.800
and the whores of the powerful.

00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:37.070
You are to-- and
he's yelling at them.

00:49:37.070 --> 00:49:38.480
He's yelling at them about this.

00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:40.021
And these are folks
who they're going

00:49:40.021 --> 00:49:42.600
to be lucky if they do,
like, illegal garage

00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:45.600
extensions in Canarsie
in Brooklyn someday.

00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:47.475
And he's yelling
at them about this.

00:49:47.475 --> 00:49:49.260
And I'm sitting
there thinking, this

00:49:49.260 --> 00:49:52.170
is the stupidest
thing I've ever seen.

00:49:52.170 --> 00:49:55.600
And it took some time to
realize that no, in fact,

00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:57.740
this was not at all stupid.

00:49:57.740 --> 00:50:00.970
And in fact, this was
something remarkably respectful

00:50:00.970 --> 00:50:03.640
he was doing, because
he was saying to them,

00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:06.940
you have the capacity to sin.

00:50:06.940 --> 00:50:09.510
You have the
capacity to do wrong.

00:50:09.510 --> 00:50:13.240
And implicit in granting the
power to people like that,

00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:15.460
and also intrinsic
in that is, thus

00:50:15.460 --> 00:50:19.060
you have the capacity to
attain a state of grace

00:50:19.060 --> 00:50:21.230
through the work
that you will do.

00:50:21.230 --> 00:50:24.600
Great other story,
Robert Oppenheimer,

00:50:24.600 --> 00:50:27.810
when the first atomic bomb
was tested, and went off,

00:50:27.810 --> 00:50:31.730
made an amazing
statement, which is "Now

00:50:31.730 --> 00:50:35.560
even physics knows sin." and
the statement there being

00:50:35.560 --> 00:50:38.920
that even something
as abstract as physics

00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:44.360
can, on some metaphorical,
some secular level, know sin.

00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:47.480
Even within the realm of
putting together buildings,

00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:50.380
if you do it toadying
for the wrong people,

00:50:50.380 --> 00:50:53.030
this could count as
a state of sinning,

00:50:53.030 --> 00:50:55.120
and intrinsic in that
is the possibility

00:50:55.120 --> 00:50:58.930
of a state of grace, even in
worlds like being a physicist

00:50:58.930 --> 00:51:01.260
or being an architect.

00:51:01.260 --> 00:51:04.220
It's not hard to see
that one for you guys,

00:51:04.220 --> 00:51:06.770
though, because of
who you all are.

00:51:06.770 --> 00:51:09.160
All of you here are privileged.

00:51:09.160 --> 00:51:10.310
You are powerful.

00:51:10.310 --> 00:51:13.430
You will have powerful
resources and connections

00:51:13.430 --> 00:51:14.620
your entire life.

00:51:14.620 --> 00:51:18.830
And it will constantly intersect
with the last 10 weeks.

00:51:18.830 --> 00:51:22.230
And it is guaranteed that some
of you, at various points,

00:51:22.230 --> 00:51:26.000
will have 30 seconds to
decide with somebody in an ER

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:28.140
who has taken a
vast amount of pills

00:51:28.140 --> 00:51:29.770
to try to kill themselves.

00:51:29.770 --> 00:51:31.700
You need to decide, is it them?

00:51:31.700 --> 00:51:33.110
Is it their disease?

00:51:33.110 --> 00:51:34.560
Is there even a boundary?

00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:37.600
Do I give the command
against their will

00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:39.460
to have their stomach pumped?

00:51:39.460 --> 00:51:42.340
Every one of you, at some
point, will make decisions

00:51:42.340 --> 00:51:45.630
about quality of life, if you
go into medical professions,

00:51:45.630 --> 00:51:47.780
as to when you pull a plug.

00:51:47.780 --> 00:51:50.200
Almost certainly,
some of you in here

00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:52.560
will be judges
someplace or other,

00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:55.480
wrestling with some of the
exact issues brought up.

00:51:55.480 --> 00:51:57.780
Some of you in here
will be legislators

00:51:57.780 --> 00:52:00.480
deciding how money
should be spent, what

00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:02.370
things money is a waste on.

00:52:02.370 --> 00:52:04.970
And you guys will be
in positions like that,

00:52:04.970 --> 00:52:08.170
because if anybody will
wind up with those powers,

00:52:08.170 --> 00:52:09.540
it will be guys.

00:52:09.540 --> 00:52:12.360
And if you remember
any of this stuff, what

00:52:12.360 --> 00:52:14.100
will seem the easiest
thing to remember

00:52:14.100 --> 00:52:19.150
is, it's so complicated, it
is impossible to fix anything.

00:52:19.150 --> 00:52:22.490
It is impossible to
make things better.

00:52:22.490 --> 00:52:25.660
And so I want to finish the
class with two final thoughts

00:52:25.660 --> 00:52:26.160
here.

00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:29.280
One is, even though
it's complicated,

00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:31.570
you've got to do something.

00:52:31.570 --> 00:52:34.590
Wonderful, cool thing I
heard about in archeology.

00:52:34.590 --> 00:52:37.030
And I don't know if this is
really true or urban legend.

00:52:37.030 --> 00:52:40.530
But when you excavate a site,
what you are supposed to do

00:52:40.530 --> 00:52:43.090
is excavate only
about half of it.

00:52:43.090 --> 00:52:45.230
You leave the other
half for the people

00:52:45.230 --> 00:52:47.820
in the future with better
techniques and better

00:52:47.820 --> 00:52:50.010
understanding, and
leave something

00:52:50.010 --> 00:52:53.460
intact there to keep from
your blundering hands.

00:52:53.460 --> 00:52:56.840
And the next person who then
excavates does only half,

00:52:56.840 --> 00:52:59.210
and half at every
juncture, saying,

00:52:59.210 --> 00:53:02.270
leave the possibility that
people will be thinking

00:53:02.270 --> 00:53:04.550
very differently in the future.

00:53:04.550 --> 00:53:06.250
Work with the
possibility that some

00:53:06.250 --> 00:53:08.810
of the things we feel
certain about right now,

00:53:08.810 --> 00:53:11.130
the smartest and most
compassionate of people

00:53:11.130 --> 00:53:14.820
500 years ago, felt that
way about epilepsy or things

00:53:14.820 --> 00:53:15.910
of that sort.

00:53:15.910 --> 00:53:17.650
It's complicated.

00:53:17.650 --> 00:53:19.640
Just because it's
complicated, that's

00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:22.100
not an excuse to do nothing.

00:53:22.100 --> 00:53:24.930
If anybody is going to do
it and make a difference,

00:53:24.930 --> 00:53:26.580
it will be you guys.

00:53:26.580 --> 00:53:31.090
The other final point is to
do in one last dichotomy, one

00:53:31.090 --> 00:53:34.800
last artificial bucket, one that
runs through this business way

00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:35.930
too often.

00:53:35.930 --> 00:53:39.560
You don't have to choose between
being compassionate and being

00:53:39.560 --> 00:53:40.880
scientific.

00:53:40.880 --> 00:53:42.980
So go and do both.

00:53:42.980 --> 00:53:44.310
And good luck.

00:53:44.310 --> 00:53:49.320

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:08.150
Stanford University.

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:11.820
The often asked question, what's
the difference between Bio 150,

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.010
Bio 250, and-- is
it Hum Bio 160?

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:17.050
No difference.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:18.330
It's exactly the same.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.060
So like the same
requirements, same unit.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.130
So take whichever one
makes your life easiest.

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.630
Let's see.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.200
Any other procedural stuff?

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.560
Well, the answers are back
from Monday's questionnaire.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.530
And a variety of
interesting answers.

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.820
Not surprisingly, given
the size of a group.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.630
Why have you taken this course?

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.390
Really want to know about animal
behavior, but willing to deal

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:45.170
with humans.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:46.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.510
Because I'm substituting it Bio
43, which I don't want to take.

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.210
My dad used to make me read
books about human behavior

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.864
and biology as punishment.

00:00:55.864 --> 00:00:56.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.160
That doesn't make any sense.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.870
I know one of the
TAs, so I figure

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:05.920
that guarantees me an A. OK,
guys, that's in your court.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.490
One I really liked,
because I want

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.530
to be a filmmaker after college.

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.980
Yay, interdisciplinary.

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.200
What else?

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.600
My first grade
teacher is making me.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.270
Tom McFadden told me to.

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.320
I'm a hyper-oxygenated
dilettante.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.920
I wanted to, somewhat
correctly pointing out,

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.450
why have you taken this class?

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.110
I haven't taken it yet.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:31.560
A number of people
reporting that,

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.280
in fact, that was
the correct answer.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.500
And my favorite, why have
you taken this course?

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.206
Yes.

00:01:37.206 --> 00:01:39.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:41.700
OK.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.340
Relevant background,
relevant background.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.180
I'm human, I'm human
and I often behave.

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.130
I'm human and I have biology.

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.390
19 years of being confused
about human behavior.

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.400
Not really, sort of.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.410
Seeing crazy behavior as
an RA in an all frosh dorm.

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.731
And I date a biologist.

00:02:03.731 --> 00:02:04.230
Let's see.

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.100
There was also the
question on there of,

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.900
did the thing on the board
look more like an A or a B.

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.759
And just to really
facilitate that one,

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.590
I forgot to put
the A and the B up.

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.740
But that taps into a
cognitive something or other,

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.730
which maybe I'll get
back to at some point.

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:19.860
Telephone numbers.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.600
Reading them off,
accuracy dramatically

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.220
tanked as soon as
the three number,

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.730
four number motif
went down the tubes.

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.610
And when it came back
briefly, accuracy

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.240
came back a little bit.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.480
Finally, let's see.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.470
All of you guys conform to
a standard frequent gender

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:38.350
difference.

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.870
Which is everybody was roughly
equally-- by gender-- roughly

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.670
equally likely to see dependent
as the opposite of independent.

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.390
A small minority went
for interdependent.

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.360
However, one finding that
has come up over and over

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.340
is that far more females are
interested in peace than males,

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.160
males are more
interested in justice.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.530
OK, have you taken the bio core.

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.270
Quote, no way Jose.

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.750
Somebody pointing
out quite correctly,

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.160
don't settle for
peace or justice.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.660
Then of course,
there was the person

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.240
who responded to that question
by writing those words are just

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.850
symbols.

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.760
Need to know assumed meaning.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.676
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:18.676 --> 00:03:19.175
OK.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.270
There was one questionnaire
that was carefully

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.900
signed in something
approaching calligraphy,

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:28.840
it was so beautiful.

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.030
And was otherwise blank.

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.770
For years running, the subject
that most people really

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:39.350
want to hear, and most people
really don't want to hear,

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.050
is about the biology
of religiosity.

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:45.420
And for 22 years running
now, Stanford students

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.661
are more interested in
depression than sex.

00:03:47.661 --> 00:03:48.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.450
OK.

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:50.960
So we start off.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:55.620
I keep telling Hennessy about
this, but nothing gets done.

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.050
We start off.

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:04.900
We start off, if
I can open this--

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.100
which is something
you can do if you have

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.500
a certain type of training.

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.630
If you're some osteologist,
or whatever these folks are

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:13.270
called.

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:15.630
If you are presented
those two skulls

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.290
and told this one's
a female, this one's

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.470
a male, you can begin to figure
out stuff like how heavy,

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.590
how large the body was
of that individual, what

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.130
diseases they had, had they
undergone malnutrition,

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.670
had they given birth, a
lot of times, a few times,

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:34.110
were they bipedal.

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.180
All sorts of stuff
you could figure out

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.950
from just looking
at these skulls.

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:41.650
What today's lecture,
and Friday's, is about

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.760
is the fact that with the
right tools under your belt,

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.890
you could look at
these two skulls

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:48.610
and know that information.

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.030
You are a field biologist, and
you've discovered this brand

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:52.960
new species.

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.726
And you see that this
one nurses an infant

00:04:55.726 --> 00:04:57.350
shortly before leaping
out of the tree,

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:58.710
leaving only the skull.

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.930
And this one has
a penis, shortly

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.980
before leaping out of the
tree and leaving a skull.

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:07.720
So all you know is this is an
adult female and an adult male.

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.860
And if you've got the
right tools there,

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.890
you can figure out who's more
likely to cheat on the other.

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:17.430
Is the female more likely to
mess around, or is the male?

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.590
How high are the
levels of aggression?

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:23.540
Does the female tend to have
twins, or one kid at a time?

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:26.590
Do females choose males because
they have good parenting

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:29.820
skills, or because
they're big, hunky guys?

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.210
What levels of differences
in life expectancy?

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.190
Do they live the
same length of time?

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:38.000
You would be able to tell
whether they have the same life

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.330
expectancy or if there's a big
discrepancy between the two.

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.660
All sorts of stuff
like that, merely

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:46.880
by applying a certain
piece of logic

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.860
that dominates all of this.

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:52.380
OK, so you're back reading
those Time Life nature

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:55.050
books back when, and there
was always a style of thing

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:55.990
you would go through.

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:58.280
Which is they'd
describe some species

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.134
doing something absolutely
amazing and unlikely,

00:06:01.134 --> 00:06:02.050
and it goes like this.

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:04.970
The giraffe, the
giraffe has a long neck,

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:08.490
and it obviously has
to have a big heart

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:10.220
to pump all that blood up there.

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:13.270
And you lock up a whole
bunch of biomechanics people

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:17.250
with slide rules, and out they
come out with this prediction

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:19.930
as to how big the
giraffe heart should be

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:21.320
and how thick the walls.

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.620
And you go and you
measure a giraffe heart,

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:26.680
and it's exactly what
the equations predicted.

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.970
And you say, isn't
nature amazing?

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:33.220
Or you read about some desert
rodents that drink once

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:35.820
every three months, and
another bunch of folks

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:39.150
have done math and figured
out how many miles long

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:41.310
the renal tubules have to be.

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:42.930
And somebody goes
and studies it,

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:45.270
and it's exactly
as you expect it.

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:46.620
Isn't nature wonderful?

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:48.300
No, nature isn't wonderful.

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.560
You couldn't have
giraffes unless they

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:52.110
had hearts that were that big.

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:54.180
You couldn't have rodents
living in the desert

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:56.890
unless they had kidneys that
worked in a certain way.

00:06:56.890 --> 00:07:02.260
There is an inevitable logic
about how organisms function,

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.720
how organisms are
built, how organisms

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:08.260
have evolved solving this
problem of optimizing

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:09.150
the solution.

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:11.640
And what the next two
lectures are about is,

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:14.090
you can take the
same exact principles

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:18.150
and apply them to thinking
about the evolution of behavior.

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:20.490
The same sort of
logic where, just

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:23.110
as you could sit there and,
with logical principles,

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:26.100
come to the point of
saying, a giraffe's heart

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:27.490
is going to be this big.

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:30.060
You can go through a
different realm of logic built

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:33.560
around evolutionary principles
and figure out all sorts

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:36.740
of aspects of social behavior.

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:40.620
And we already know what's
involved in, say, optimizing.

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:43.290
What's the optimal number
of whatevers in your kidney.

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:46.520
What's the optimal behavior
strategy or something.

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:49.800
All of us, as soon as
we got some kid sibling,

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:54.020
learned how to do the optimal
strategy in tic-tac-toe.

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:56.780
So that you could never lose,
and it's totally boring.

00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:00.320
But that's a case of figuring
out the optimal solution

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:04.130
to behavior, reaching what is
called the Nash equilibrium.

00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:06.120
And actually, I have no
idea what I just said.

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:08.070
But I like making
reference to Nash,

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:10.890
because it makes me feel
quantitative or something.

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:14.810
So that is called
the Nash equilibrium.

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:18.040
The Nash equilibrium, and
what the entire point here is,

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:20.750
the same sort of
process of figuring out

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:24.780
what are the rules of
optimizing tic-tac-toe behavior

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:27.390
can be built upon the
principles of evolution

00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:29.690
to figure out all
sorts of realms

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:32.610
of optimized social behavior.

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:37.150
And broadly, this is a field
that's known as sociobiology,

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:41.549
emerging in the late
1970s-- mid 1970s or so.

00:08:41.549 --> 00:08:43.600
And by the late
1980s, giving birth

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:47.270
to another discipline known
as evolutionary psychology.

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:50.760
The notion that you cannot
understand behavior,

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:54.770
and you cannot understand
internal psychological states,

00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:58.000
outside the context of evolution
had something to do with

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.830
sculpting those behaviors
and those psyches.

00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:04.410
So to start off with that, basic
song and dance about Darwin.

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:06.970
Just to make sure we're
up to speed on this.

00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:09.610
Darwin, just to get some
things out of the way.

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:11.990
Darwin did not
discover evolution.

00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:14.490
People knew about
evolution long before that.

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:16.970
Darwin came up with the
notion of a mechanism

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:18.890
for evolution,
natural selection.

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:22.640
And in fact, Darwin is
the inventor of that.

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:24.970
There was another guy,
Alfred Russel Wallace,

00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:25.830
the two of them.

00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:28.710
And, for some reason, Wallace
has gotten screwed historically

00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:30.460
and Darwin gets
much more attention.

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:34.640
But starting off with a
Darwinian view of how evolution

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:35.850
works.

00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:38.270
First thing being that
there is evolution.

00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:41.900
Traits in populations
change over time.

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:44.470
Traits can change enough
that, in fact, you

00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:45.830
will get speciation.

00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:47.560
New species will form.

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:50.560
And the logic of
Darwinian evolution

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:55.460
is built on just a few couple
of very reasonable steps.

00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:59.980
First one is that there are
traits that are heritable.

00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:03.570
Traits that could be passed
on one generation to the next.

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:05.470
Traits that we
now can translate,

00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:09.190
in our modern parlance, into
traits that are genetic.

00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:12.040
And we will see, soon, how
that's totally not correct

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:12.920
to have said that.

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:15.420
But traits that are heritable.

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:20.280
The next thing is that there is
variability among those traits.

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:24.470
There's different ways in
which this trait can occur,

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:26.800
and they're all heritable.

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:28.640
The next critical thing.

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:33.750
Some versions of those traits
are more adaptive than others.

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:36.530
Some versions work
better for you.

00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:39.280
For example, giraffe
who wind up with hearts

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:42.850
the size of, like, a tomato,
that's not an optimal version.

00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:45.490
Amid the range of
variability, some

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:49.370
will carry with them more
fitness, more adaptiveness,

00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:50.720
than others.

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:53.520
And that translates
into another sound bite

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.160
that's got to be gotten rid of.

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:59.410
All of this is not about
survival of the most adapted.

00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:01.610
It's about reproduction,
something we will

00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:03.280
come to over and over again.

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:05.680
It's about the number
of copies of genes you

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:07.270
leave in the next generation.

00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:09.510
So you've got to have
traits that are heritable.

00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:12.000
There's got to be
variability in them.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.770
Some of those traits are
more adaptive than others.

00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:16.160
Some of those
traits make it more

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:19.870
likely that that organism
passes on copies of its genes

00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:21.260
into the next generation.

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.560
And throw those three pieces
together, and what you will get

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:26.910
is evolution in populations.

00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:29.380
Changing frequencies of traits.

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:32.160
And when you throw in one
additional piece, which

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:34.480
is every now and
then the possibility

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:37.960
to have a random introduction
of a new type of trait

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:42.000
in there-- modern parlance,
a mutation-- from that,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.610
you can begin to get actual
large changes in what

00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:47.600
a population looks like.

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:50.760
OK, so these are the basic
building blocks of Darwin.

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:53.220
And it is easy to apply
it to giraffes' hearts

00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:56.320
and kidneys of desert rats,
and everything we think about

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:59.390
in the world of
physiology, anatomy,

00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:01.590
in the context of evolution.

00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:04.180
So how do you apply
it to behavior?

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:06.390
And the basic notion,
for folks who've

00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:07.980
come from this
Darwinian tradition

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:11.150
into thinking about behavior,
is you do the exact same thing.

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:15.940
There are behaviors that are
heritable, types, traits,

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:17.390
classes of behaviors.

00:12:17.390 --> 00:12:20.990
They come with a certain degree
of variation among individuals.

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:24.730
Some versions of them are
more adaptive than others.

00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:27.110
Over time, the more
adaptive versions

00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:28.990
will become more commonplace.

00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:31.250
And every now and then,
you can have mutations

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:33.340
that introduce new variability.

00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:36.600
Totally logical,
absolutely unassailable.

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:39.120
And what we're going to spend
an insane amount of time

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:42.180
in this class on is
one simple assumption

00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:46.180
in there, which is that certain
behaviors are heritable.

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:48.930
That certain behaviors
have genetic components.

00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:50.560
And as you'll see,
this one is just

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:53.170
going to run through
every lecture wrestling

00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:54.560
with that issue there.

00:12:54.560 --> 00:13:00.155
This is a big incendiary issue
there as to how genetic--

00:13:00.155 --> 00:13:01.780
and that's not the
same thing as saying

00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:06.630
how genetically determined--
how genetic behavior is.

00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:10.110
So that's going to be an
issue we come back to again

00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:11.060
and again.

00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:14.030
So now, transitioning
into how you would apply

00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:16.520
these Darwinian principles.

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:19.470
First thing before
starting, a caveat.

00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:21.730
You're going to wind up,
in order to think about all

00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:25.100
of this most efficiently,
hopefully do some personifying.

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:28.500
Personifying as in, you'll
sit around saying, well,

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:30.824
what would a female
chimpanzee want

00:13:30.824 --> 00:13:32.990
to do at this point to
optimize the number of copies

00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:34.690
of her genes in the
next generation?

00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:37.000
What would this
brine shrimp want

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.360
to do to deal with this
environmental stressor?

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:42.630
What would this cherry tree do?

00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:43.810
They're not planning.

00:13:43.810 --> 00:13:44.770
They're not conscious.

00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:47.230
They're not taking classes
in evolutionary biology.

00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:49.570
What would this
organism want to do

00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:53.380
is just a shorthand
for something sculpted

00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:56.210
by the sort of
exigencies of evolution,

00:13:56.210 --> 00:13:58.520
and reducing the optimal.

00:13:58.520 --> 00:13:59.700
They want to do this.

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:01.790
This is just going to be
a short hand throughout.

00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:04.120
Once you get past
the apes, nobody

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:07.000
is wanting to do any of
these optimization things.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.230
So just getting that sort of
terminology out of the way.

00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:13.150
OK, so we start off with
what's the first building

00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:17.450
block of applying Darwinian
principles to behavior.

00:14:17.450 --> 00:14:20.332
Something that is absolutely
critical to emphasize,

00:14:20.332 --> 00:14:22.040
because the first
thing we all need to do

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:25.930
is unlearn something we all
learned back when on all those

00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:29.870
National Geographic specials
and that would consistently

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:32.330
teach us something about
this aspect of evolution,

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:34.910
and would always
teach it to us wrong.

00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:36.200
Here's the scenario.

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:39.000
So you're watching, and there's
this wildlife documentary.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.730
It's dawn on the savanna.

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:44.370
And you see, there's
a whole bunch lions

00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:46.640
on top of some big
old dead thing.

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:48.220
Some buffalo, or something.

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:53.040
And they're chewing away
and having a fine time.

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:55.730
So something happens
at that point,

00:14:55.730 --> 00:15:01.000
which is, they have to deal
with how they divvy up the food.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.680
Or let me give you
another example.

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:05.370
Another standard, sort
of endless vignette

00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:07.630
that comes up in these films.

00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:09.750
Once again, now, you're
back on the savanna.

00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:11.580
It's not dawn this
time, but you are

00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:13.700
looking at one of the
magnificent things

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:17.410
of the natural world, which
is the migration of zebras

00:15:17.410 --> 00:15:18.490
throughout East Africa.

00:15:18.490 --> 00:15:21.730
A herd of 2 million of them
migrate around, following

00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:23.780
a cyclical pattern of rains.

00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:26.120
So they're always going
where the grass is greener.

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:28.740
So you've got this wonderful
herd of 2 million wildebeest,

00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:30.360
and there's a problem.

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:33.230
Which is, there's some great
field right in front of them

00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:35.870
full of grass, and
bummer, there's

00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:38.370
a river in between them
and the next field.

00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:42.290
And especially a bummer, a
river teeming with crocodiles

00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:44.050
just ready to grab them.

00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:47.000
So what are the
wildebeest going to do?

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.900
And according to the
National Geographic type

00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:52.640
specials we would get,
out would come a solution.

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:55.230
There's all the wildebeest
hemming and hawing

00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:58.090
in this agitated state
by the edge of the river.

00:15:58.090 --> 00:16:00.830
And suddenly, from
the back of the crowd,

00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:04.510
comes this elderly wildebeest
who pushes his way up

00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:06.560
to the front, stands on
the edge of the river

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:08.980
and says, I sacrifice
myself for you,

00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:11.500
meine kinder, and throws
himself into the river--

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:12.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.120
--where immediately, the
crocs get busy eating him up.

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:16.686
And the other two
million wildebeest

00:16:16.686 --> 00:16:18.810
could tiptoe around the
other way across the river,

00:16:18.810 --> 00:16:20.020
and everybody is fine.

00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:23.380
And you're then saying,
why'd this guy do this?

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:25.700
Why did this guy fling
himself into the river?

00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:29.050
And we would get the
answer at that point.

00:16:29.050 --> 00:16:33.120
The answer that is permeated
as, like, the worst urban myth

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:34.130
of evolution.

00:16:34.130 --> 00:16:34.700
Whatever.

00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:36.300
Why did he do that?

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:40.710
Because animals behave for
the good of the species.

00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:43.940
This is the notion that has
to be completely trashed right

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:44.600
now.

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:47.190
Animals behaving for
the good of the species

00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:50.510
really came to the forefront,
a guy in the early 60s named

00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:51.750
Wynne-Edwards.

00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:53.450
Hyphenated, Wynne-Edwards.

00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:57.830
Some hyphenated Brit zoologist,
who pushed most strongly

00:16:57.830 --> 00:17:01.220
this notion of
that animals behave

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:03.770
for the good of the species.

00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:07.540
He is reviled throughout
every textbook, Wynne-Edwards

00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:08.569
and group selection.

00:17:08.569 --> 00:17:10.339
That would be the
term, selection

00:17:10.339 --> 00:17:12.400
for the good of groups,
for the selection

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:13.690
for the good of the species.

00:17:13.690 --> 00:17:15.770
Wynne-Edwards and
group selection.

00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:18.980
I'm sure the guy did all
sorts of other useful things.

00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:22.366
And anyone who really has any
depth to them would find out.

00:17:22.366 --> 00:17:24.240
But all I know is that
the guy is the one who

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:26.079
came up with group selection.

00:17:26.079 --> 00:17:29.520
Animals behave for the
good of the species.

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:31.610
This isn't the case at all.

00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:36.230
Animals behave for passing on
as many copies of their genes

00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:37.350
as possible.

00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:39.380
And what we'll see
is, when you start

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:42.170
looking at the nuances
of that, sometimes it

00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:45.220
may look like behaving for
the good of the species.

00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:47.820
But it really isn't the case.

00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:51.250
So animals behave
in order to maximize

00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:52.682
the number of
copies of genes they

00:17:52.682 --> 00:17:53.890
leave in the next generation.

00:17:53.890 --> 00:17:55.980
Remember, not survival
of the fittest,

00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:57.690
reproduction of the fittest.

00:17:57.690 --> 00:18:01.220
So first thing you need to do
is go back to that vignette

00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:04.460
and saying, so what's up
with the wildebeest there?

00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:07.120
And what's up with the elderly
guy who jumps in the river?

00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:10.160
And finally, when you
look at them long enough

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:12.660
instead of the camera crew
showing up for three minutes,

00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:14.640
when you studied
this closely enough,

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:17.350
you see something that
wasn't apparent at first.

00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:19.820
Which is, this
elderly wildebeest

00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:22.460
is not fighting his
way through the crowd.

00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:24.695
This guy is being
pushed from behind.

00:18:24.695 --> 00:18:25.330
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:27.047
This guy is being
pushed from behind,

00:18:27.047 --> 00:18:28.630
because all the other
ones are saying,

00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:30.820
yeah, get the old
guy on the river.

00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:32.710
Sacrificing himself, my ass.

00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:35.540
This guy is getting pushed
in by everybody else.

00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:38.550
He is not sacrificing himself
for the good of the species.

00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:41.280
He does not like the
idea of this whatsoever.

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:44.320
So he gets pushed in
because the old, weak guy.

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:46.530
None of this group
selection stuff.

00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:49.680
What came in by the
'70s as a replacement,

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:53.370
a way to think about this,
is this notion of animals,

00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:56.020
including us, behaving not
for the good of the species

00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:58.770
or of the group, but to maximize
the number of copies of genes

00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:00.540
left in the next generation.

00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:04.640
And what you see is three ways
in which this could occur.

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:06.420
Three building blocks.

00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:10.980
The first one being known
as individual selection.

00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:13.160
The first one, built
around the notion

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:15.680
that sometimes the
behavior of an animal

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:19.060
is meant to optimize the
number of copies of its genes

00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:21.190
that it leaves in
the next generation

00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:23.580
by itself reproducing.

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:25.650
The drive to
reproduce, the drive

00:19:25.650 --> 00:19:27.810
to leave more copies
of one's genes.

00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:32.450
This was once summarized
really sort of tersely as,

00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:37.820
sometimes a chicken is an egg's
way of making another chicken.

00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:39.610
No, that's backwards.

00:19:39.610 --> 00:19:44.360
Sometimes a chicken is an egg's
way of making another egg.

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:46.990
OK, ignore that.

00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:50.820
What the guy said is, sometimes
a chicken is an egg's way

00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:52.150
of making another egg.

00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:57.160
All this behavior stuff,
and all this animate social

00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:59.480
interaction, is just
an epiphenomenon

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:03.810
to get more copies of the
genes into the next generation.

00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:07.570
Individual selection, a subset
of way of thinking about this

00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:09.380
is selfish genes.

00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:12.120
What behavior is
about is maximizing

00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:14.880
the number of copies of
genes in the next generation.

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:17.770
And sometimes the best
way to do it, sometimes

00:20:17.770 --> 00:20:21.140
the way that animals maximize,
is to get as many copies

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:23.430
by way of reproducing
themselves.

00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:25.700
It's not quite equivalent
to The Selfish Gene,

00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:29.460
but for our purposes,
individual selection.

00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:31.970
And this can play out
in a number of realms.

00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:34.450
And bringing in sort
of a big dichotomy

00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:37.040
in thinking about
evolutionary pressures, Darwin

00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:39.170
and the theory of
natural selection.

00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:41.830
What natural
selection is about is

00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:46.230
processes bringing about an
organism who is more adaptive,

00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:47.440
what we just went through.

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:50.860
Darwin soon recognized there
was a second realm of selection,

00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:52.920
which he called
sexual selection.

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:55.150
And what that one's
about is, this

00:20:55.150 --> 00:20:57.080
is selecting for
traits that have

00:20:57.080 --> 00:21:01.580
no value whatsoever in terms of
survival or anything like that.

00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:03.800
Traits that carry
no adaptive value,

00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:07.940
but for some random, bizarre
reason, the opposite sex

00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:09.930
likes folks who look this way.

00:21:09.930 --> 00:21:12.900
So they get to leave more
copies of their genes.

00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:16.350
And suddenly, you could have
natural selection bringing

00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:19.750
about big, sharp
antlers in male moose,

00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:23.440
and they use that for fighting
off predators or fighting

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:24.060
with a male.

00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:26.090
That would be natural selection.

00:21:26.090 --> 00:21:28.610
Sexual selection might
account for the fact

00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:32.270
that the antlers are
green, paisley patterns all

00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:33.020
over for that.

00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:35.410
And for some reason,
that looks cool.

00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:38.560
The female moose is,
and what you wind up

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:40.820
getting as a mechanism
for sexual selection

00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:45.550
is, as long as individuals
prefer to mate with individuals

00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:48.990
with some completely
arbitrary traits,

00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:51.690
those traits will also
become more common.

00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:54.470
So this dichotomy
of natural selection

00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:58.080
for traits driven by
traits that really do

00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:01.520
aid leaving copies of genes
outside the realm of just

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:04.390
sheer sexual preference,
sexual selection.

00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:07.480
And sometimes they can go in
absolutely opposite directions.

00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:12.230
You can get some species
where the female fish

00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:15.330
prefer male fish that have
very bright coloration.

00:22:15.330 --> 00:22:18.070
And that's advantageous, then,
to have the bright coloration

00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:19.680
by means of sexual selection.

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:21.310
But the bright
coloration makes you

00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:23.930
more likely to get predated
by some other fish.

00:22:23.930 --> 00:22:27.130
Natural selection pushing
against bright coloration

00:22:27.130 --> 00:22:27.770
in males.

00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:31.190
Very often, you've got the
two going against each other,

00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:32.790
having to balance.

00:22:32.790 --> 00:22:35.050
So how would that be
applied in this realm

00:22:35.050 --> 00:22:36.840
of individual selection?

00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:38.560
This first building block.

00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:41.450
Sometimes an egg-- damn.

00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:44.120
Sometimes a chicken is an egg's
way of making another egg.

00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:47.480
Sometimes what behavior is
about is one individual trying

00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:49.620
to maximize the number
of copies of their genes

00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:50.740
in the next generation.

00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:53.060
A natural selection
manifestation of it

00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:56.260
being, you're good at
running away from predators.

00:22:56.260 --> 00:23:00.180
Selection for speed, for certain
types of muscle metabolism,

00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:03.180
for certain sets of sensory
systems that will tell you

00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:04.950
there's somebody scary around.

00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:07.170
That would be the realm of that.

00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:10.710
Individual selection, selecting
the realm of sexual selection

00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:14.170
to have more of whatever those
traits that are attractive.

00:23:14.170 --> 00:23:17.610
So this first building block,
it's not group selection.

00:23:17.610 --> 00:23:19.590
It's not behaving for
the good of the species.

00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:22.360
It's behaving to maximize the
number of copies of one's genes

00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:23.460
in the next generation.

00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:25.250
And the most
straightforward way is

00:23:25.250 --> 00:23:28.380
to behave in a way to
maximize the number of times

00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:31.000
you reproduce yourself.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.820
Second building
block, which is, there

00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:37.340
is another way of accomplishing
the same thing that you just

00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:40.490
did with individual
selection, as follows.

00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:42.890
One of the things that
can be relied upon in life

00:23:42.890 --> 00:23:45.470
is that you are related
to your relatives.

00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:49.930
And what you get is, the
more closely related you are,

00:23:49.930 --> 00:23:52.600
the more genes you share
in common with them.

00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:55.030
On a statistical
level, identical twins

00:23:55.030 --> 00:23:57.650
share 100% of their genes.

00:23:57.650 --> 00:23:59.540
Full siblings, 50%.

00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:01.210
Half siblings, 25%.

00:24:01.210 --> 00:24:02.800
This is exactly
something that's going

00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:05.080
to be covered in the catch
up section this week.

00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:07.680
If you're not comfortable with
this stuff, this sort of thing

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:09.290
will be reviewed in more detail.

00:24:09.290 --> 00:24:14.010
OK, so the closer a
relative is to you,

00:24:14.010 --> 00:24:17.550
the more genes they
share in common with you.

00:24:17.550 --> 00:24:19.540
So suddenly, you've
got this issue.

00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:22.510
You're an identical twin
and your identical sibling

00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:24.800
has the same genes that you do.

00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:28.830
Individual selection, you
will be just as successful

00:24:28.830 --> 00:24:32.050
as passing on copies of your
genes into the next generation

00:24:32.050 --> 00:24:35.300
if you forgo
reproducing to make it

00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:38.120
possible for your
identical twin to do so.

00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:40.920
Because on the level
of just sheer numbers

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:43.330
of copies of genes in
the next generation,

00:24:43.330 --> 00:24:45.180
they are equivalent.

00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:49.290
And sometimes, you will thus get
behavior which really decreases

00:24:49.290 --> 00:24:52.370
the reproductive
success of an individual

00:24:52.370 --> 00:24:56.570
in order to enhance the
success of a relative.

00:24:56.570 --> 00:24:58.560
But you've got a
constraint there,

00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:00.770
which is, all of
your relatives don't

00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:02.630
share all your genes with you.

00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:05.870
They have differing
degrees of relatedness.

00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:09.070
And what that winds up
producing is another factor,

00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:10.220
another observation.

00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:13.430
One of the great, witty
geneticists of all time, a guy

00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:16.050
named Haldane who,
apparently, once in a bar

00:25:16.050 --> 00:25:18.190
was trying to explain
this principle to somebody

00:25:18.190 --> 00:25:20.530
and came up and
said, I will gladly

00:25:20.530 --> 00:25:24.350
lay down my life for two
brothers or eight cousins.

00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:27.190
And that's the math
of the relatedness.

00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:30.090
You passing on one
copy of your genes

00:25:30.090 --> 00:25:34.550
to the next generation is, from
the sheer mathematics of just

00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:37.500
how evolution is going to
play out over the generations,

00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:43.020
is exactly equivalent as giving
up your life for eight cousins

00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:45.900
to be able to each pass
on a copy of their genes.

00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:47.610
Because you share 1/8
with each of them,

00:25:47.610 --> 00:25:49.360
and it winds up being
a whole [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:51.340
And it's that math.

00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:53.600
And out of that, you
get something that

00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:55.580
makes perfect sense instantly.

00:25:55.580 --> 00:25:59.760
Which is, evolution selects
for organisms cooperating

00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:01.710
with their relatives.

00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:03.300
Something along those lines.

00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:05.690
And thus we have this
second building block

00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:08.140
known as kin selection.

00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:09.560
Inclusive fitness.

00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:10.800
Kin selection.

00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:14.760
First building block, individual
selection, passing on copies

00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:18.010
of your own genes as a way
to maximize future success.

00:26:18.010 --> 00:26:21.160
Second version,
helping out relatives.

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:24.700
Helping out relatives
in terms of increasing

00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:28.590
their reproductive success
with this vicious mathematical

00:26:28.590 --> 00:26:32.620
logic, which is
one identical twin

00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:36.270
to have two full siblings,
eight cousins, and so on,

00:26:36.270 --> 00:26:38.980
as a function of
degree of relatedness.

00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:42.570
And what this begins to
explain is a whole world

00:26:42.570 --> 00:26:47.150
in animal behavior of animals
being obsessed with kinship.

00:26:47.150 --> 00:26:51.910
Animals being fully aware of
who is related to who in what

00:26:51.910 --> 00:26:53.090
sorts of ways.

00:26:53.090 --> 00:26:55.520
Animals being
utterly aware of you

00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:58.280
cooperate with relatives,
but as a function of how

00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:00.620
closely related they are.

00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:04.570
Animals put us in Social
Anthropology, in kinship terms,

00:27:04.570 --> 00:27:07.490
and could you marry the daughter
of your uncle's third wife

00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:09.480
or whatever, to
shame in terms of how

00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:13.900
much a lot of social animals
deal with relatedness.

00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:16.940
So inclusive fitness,
kin selection.

00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:18.340
Here would be evidence for it.

00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:19.550
Here's one example.

00:27:19.550 --> 00:27:23.830
Very cool study done some years
back by a couple, Seyfarth

00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:25.640
and Cheney, University
of Pennsylvania,

00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:27.170
looking at vervet monkeys.

00:27:27.170 --> 00:27:30.877
And these were vervet monkeys
out in Tanzania, I believe.

00:27:30.877 --> 00:27:33.210
What they did was, a whole
bunch of these vervet monkeys

00:27:33.210 --> 00:27:34.300
were sitting around.

00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:38.060
And they, the researchers,
had made really high quality

00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:41.160
recording recordings of
various vocalizations

00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:42.500
from the monkeys over time.

00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:45.440
So they had the sound of each
animal giving an alarm call,

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:48.260
giving a friendly gesture
call, giving a whatever.

00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:51.070
And what they would then
do is hide a microphone

00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:55.480
inside some bushes and play
the sound of one of the infants

00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:58.870
from the group
giving an alarm call.

00:27:58.870 --> 00:28:01.320
So what does the mother
of that infant do?

00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:04.700
She instantly gets agitated
and looks over at the bush.

00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:06.570
That's her child, all of that.

00:28:06.570 --> 00:28:09.930
How to know that everyone
else in that vervet group

00:28:09.930 --> 00:28:13.440
understands kin selection,
what does everybody else do?

00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:16.310
They all look at the mother.

00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:20.140
That's whoever's mother,
what is she going to do next?

00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:23.680
They understand the
relatedness, and they understand

00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:25.080
what the response will be.

00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:28.630
All the other vervets look
at the mother at that point.

00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:31.540
Whoa, I'm sure glad that's
not my kid giving an alarm

00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:32.810
call from the bushes.

00:28:32.810 --> 00:28:34.840
They understand kinship.

00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:37.640
Another version of that
came out in these studies.

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:41.240
So you've got two females, each
of whom has a kid, a daughter,

00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:41.910
whatever.

00:28:41.910 --> 00:28:45.350
And female A and female
B. And one day, female A

00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:49.900
does something absolutely
rotten to female B.

00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:53.060
And later that day,
the child of female B

00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:56.280
is more likely than chance
to do something rotten

00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:58.910
to the child of
female A. They're

00:28:58.910 --> 00:29:01.330
keeping track of
not only revenge,

00:29:01.330 --> 00:29:03.140
but not revenge on
the individual who

00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:06.530
did something miserable to
you, but displaced by one

00:29:06.530 --> 00:29:08.550
degree of reproduction.

00:29:08.550 --> 00:29:10.560
Keeping track of kinship.

00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:11.810
Animals can do this.

00:29:11.810 --> 00:29:14.250
All sorts of primate
species can do this.

00:29:14.250 --> 00:29:18.370
And as we'll see, all sorts of
other species can do this also.

00:29:18.370 --> 00:29:19.560
There is that caveat again.

00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:22.627
All sorts of other
species want to figure out

00:29:22.627 --> 00:29:24.710
who their cousins-- they
don't want to figure out.

00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:27.210
Evolution has
sculpted an ability

00:29:27.210 --> 00:29:31.000
to optimize behavior
along lines of relatedness

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.150
in all sorts of species.

00:29:33.150 --> 00:29:35.260
So how would natural
selection play out

00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:38.760
in this realm of kin
selection, I will lay down

00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:40.880
my life for eight cousins.

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:43.780
And that's just sort of
obvious there by now.

00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:47.090
How would sexual selection
play out in this realm.

00:29:47.090 --> 00:29:50.030
I am willing to expend
great amounts of energy

00:29:50.030 --> 00:29:54.920
to convince people that my
sibling is incredibly hot.

00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:56.840
And with any
chance, then passing

00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:58.340
on more copies of genes.

00:29:58.340 --> 00:30:02.130
That would be inclusive fitness,
kin selection in both cases.

00:30:02.130 --> 00:30:06.330
Decreasing your own
reproductive potential

00:30:06.330 --> 00:30:09.300
by way of being killed by a
predator to save the 8 cousins,

00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:12.810
or having to spend so much time
haranguing about your sibling.

00:30:12.810 --> 00:30:15.320
Doings that, in
order to increase

00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:18.140
the reproductive
success of relatives,

00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:20.770
where you were willing
to give up more energy

00:30:20.770 --> 00:30:23.870
and potential on your part,
the more closely related

00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:25.960
the individual is.

00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:28.240
So you throw those
two pieces together,

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:29.830
and you're suddenly
off and running

00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:32.610
with explaining a lot
of animal behavior.

00:30:32.610 --> 00:30:34.714
Individual selection,
none of this

00:30:34.714 --> 00:30:35.880
for the good of the species.

00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:39.160
Maximizing the number of
copies of your own genes.

00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:41.800
And the easiest way, the
most straightforward,

00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:45.460
is you yourself
maximizing reproduction.

00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:49.170
Foundation number two the
whole thing, kin selection.

00:30:49.170 --> 00:30:51.830
Sometimes the best way of
leaving more copies of genes

00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:53.930
in the next
generation is using up

00:30:53.930 --> 00:30:56.340
your own reproductive
potential foregoing

00:30:56.340 --> 00:31:00.470
to help relatives as a function
of degree of relatedness.

00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:02.240
OK, that's great.

00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:05.690
So now the third piece, the
third final building block

00:31:05.690 --> 00:31:08.470
of making sense of social
behavior in the context

00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:12.000
of real contemporary
evolutionary theory,

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.610
the third block here.

00:31:13.610 --> 00:31:17.900
Which is, you look at animals
and they're not all just

00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:20.910
competing with non-relatives.

00:31:20.910 --> 00:31:24.890
Animals forego competition
at certain points.

00:31:24.890 --> 00:31:27.140
Animals would have
the potential to be

00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:31.250
aggressive to other animals,
and they will forego doing so.

00:31:31.250 --> 00:31:33.750
And there's one circumstance
in which that can happen,

00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:37.640
where you get what is called a
rock-paper-scissors scenario.

00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:43.410
You've got animals A, B, and
C. A has a means of damaging B,

00:31:43.410 --> 00:31:46.260
but it costs A. B has
a means of damaging C,

00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:47.950
but it costs B. C
can damage A, but it

00:31:47.950 --> 00:31:51.540
costs A. You get the right
distribution of individuals

00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:54.040
with one of those
traits in a population,

00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:57.630
and you will reach a
rock-scissors-paper equilibrium

00:31:57.630 --> 00:32:00.590
where nobody's doing anything
rotten to each other.

00:32:00.590 --> 00:32:03.330
Great example, totally
cool example that got

00:32:03.330 --> 00:32:06.410
published some years ago by a
guy named Brendan Bohannan, who

00:32:06.410 --> 00:32:09.390
was assistant professor in the
department here at the time.

00:32:09.390 --> 00:32:12.470
He was studying something
or other about bacteria

00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:15.430
showing a rock-paper-scissors
circumstance.

00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:18.670
You had three different types,
three different versions,

00:32:18.670 --> 00:32:21.300
of this bacteria in
this colony he had made.

00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:28.040
The first one could generate
a poison, but it cost.

00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:30.400
It had to put the effort
into making that poison

00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:33.280
and protecting itself from
that poison, all of that.

00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:36.310
The second type was
vulnerable to the poison.

00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:39.710
It happened to have some
transporter on its membrane

00:32:39.710 --> 00:32:42.540
that took up the poison,
and that was bad news.

00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:45.540
But it had an advantage,
which is the rest of the time,

00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:49.920
that transporter
took up more food.

00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:51.990
The third one, the
good thing going

00:32:51.990 --> 00:32:55.300
for it is that it didn't
have-- the bad thing

00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:57.630
was, it didn't have poison.

00:32:57.630 --> 00:32:59.440
A good thing going
for it was it didn't

00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:01.370
have to spend
energy on a poison,

00:33:01.370 --> 00:33:03.570
and it didn't have
that transporter.

00:33:03.570 --> 00:33:06.520
So each one of those has a
strength, each one of those

00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:07.680
has a vulnerability.

00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:10.270
They're like, I don't
know, Pokemon or something.

00:33:10.270 --> 00:33:12.110
And you put them
all together there,

00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:14.950
and you get a
rock-paper-scissors scenario

00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:18.130
where you get equilibrium,
where they are not

00:33:18.130 --> 00:33:19.410
attacking each other.

00:33:19.410 --> 00:33:24.200
Because note, if I
am A and I destroy B,

00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:26.730
B's no longer
wiping out C, who's

00:33:26.730 --> 00:33:28.050
the one who could damage me.

00:33:28.050 --> 00:33:30.810
It's got to come to
an equilibrium state.

00:33:30.810 --> 00:33:34.230
So you can get the evolution
of stalemates like that,

00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:36.600
and that's quite
frequently seen.

00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:38.660
And note here, this
was the evolution

00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:43.470
of stalemates not in chimps, not
in cetaceans, but in bacteria.

00:33:43.470 --> 00:33:47.380
What we're going to see
is bacterial behavior,

00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:50.180
to the extent that this is sort
of a metaphor for behavior.

00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:52.970
Behavior of all sorts
of unlikely species

00:33:52.970 --> 00:33:56.280
are subject to these
same rules of passing

00:33:56.280 --> 00:33:57.940
on copies of your genes.

00:33:57.940 --> 00:34:00.260
These three different
strains of bacteria

00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:02.380
are competing with each other.

00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:06.170
None of them are behaving for
the good of the species there

00:34:06.170 --> 00:34:07.630
of the three of them.

00:34:07.630 --> 00:34:09.800
So rock-paper-scissors
is very cool,

00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:12.320
and you get versions
of that in humans.

00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:15.090
That's been sort of studied
quantitatively, all of that.

00:34:15.090 --> 00:34:16.989
But that's not real cooperation.

00:34:16.989 --> 00:34:19.000
That's merely
everybody realizing

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.469
we have to cut back
on the competition.

00:34:21.469 --> 00:34:23.560
We have to cut back
on the aggression.

00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:25.949
Because every time
I damage whoever,

00:34:25.949 --> 00:34:27.929
I am more vulnerable
in another realm.

00:34:27.929 --> 00:34:29.080
That's a stalemate.

00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:30.810
That's a truce.

00:34:30.810 --> 00:34:33.480
But you look at animals,
and in all sorts of realms,

00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:35.870
it's not just
rock-paper-scissors stalemates

00:34:35.870 --> 00:34:36.600
they're reaching.

00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:39.000
They actually cooperate
with each other.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:43.170
And you look close enough, and
you see they're not relatives.

00:34:43.170 --> 00:34:45.409
They're not
relatives, yet you get

00:34:45.409 --> 00:34:47.719
all sorts of
altruistic behavior,

00:34:47.719 --> 00:34:51.090
and you've got it under
a whole bunch of domains.

00:34:51.090 --> 00:34:52.690
Because this brings
up the question,

00:34:52.690 --> 00:34:55.170
why should you
ever be cooperative

00:34:55.170 --> 00:34:57.520
with another individual if
you are a social animal.

00:34:57.520 --> 00:35:01.240
At every possibility, you
should stab them in the back

00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:02.390
and be selfish.

00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:04.100
And the reason why
that isn't a good idea

00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:06.660
is, there's all sorts
of circumstances where

00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:09.100
many hands make the task light.

00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:14.120
Or whatever that is, cooperation
can have synergistic benefits.

00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:16.190
And you see that
with species that

00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:19.360
are cooperative hunters,
where they are not necessarily

00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:20.110
relatives.

00:35:20.110 --> 00:35:22.310
They will chase one,
chasing an animal

00:35:22.310 --> 00:35:25.100
while the other is getting
ready to cut a corner on it.

00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:28.750
Cooperative behavior, and
they increase the likelihood

00:35:28.750 --> 00:35:30.570
of them getting a kill.

00:35:30.570 --> 00:35:32.130
Another example of this.

00:35:32.130 --> 00:35:33.960
Research by a guy
named Mark Hauser

00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:36.550
at Harvard looking
at rhesus monkeys.

00:35:36.550 --> 00:35:38.940
And what he showed was,
he would put these monkeys

00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:42.530
in a situation where
they had access to food.

00:35:42.530 --> 00:35:45.360
They had access to food
under one circumstance,

00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:50.200
where they could reach for it
and take it in and share it

00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:52.100
with another monkey.

00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:56.040
Under the other circumstance,
it required two monkeys

00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:57.730
to get the food in there.

00:35:57.730 --> 00:36:01.070
And what he showed was
clear cut reciprocity.

00:36:01.070 --> 00:36:03.780
Monkeys who were
sharing with this guy

00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:05.720
were more likely to
get shared back with

00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:09.170
and got more cooperation when
it was a task where two of them

00:36:09.170 --> 00:36:11.230
had to work together
to get the food.

00:36:11.230 --> 00:36:12.780
One alone wasn't enough.

00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:15.860
Many hands make the task
lighter under all sorts

00:36:15.860 --> 00:36:17.100
of circumstances.

00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:21.070
Cooperation has a strong
evolutionary payoff,

00:36:21.070 --> 00:36:25.680
even among non-relatives,
with a condition.

00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:28.050
Which is, you're not
putting more into it

00:36:28.050 --> 00:36:29.560
than you are getting.

00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:31.500
That is reciprocal.

00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:35.100
And ' opens up the third
building block of all of this,

00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:38.650
which is reciprocal altruism.

00:36:38.650 --> 00:36:42.610
Cooperation, altruistic
behavior among non-relatives,

00:36:42.610 --> 00:36:46.040
but undergoing very
strict constraints of,

00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:50.750
it's gotta be reciprocated with
all sorts of rules like that.

00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:53.630
So what does that look like.

00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:55.560
You're going to see
reciprocal altruism,

00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:56.800
when would you see that.

00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:59.160
What's the immediate
thing, what sort of species

00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:02.400
would show systems of
reciprocal cooperation

00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:03.940
among non-relatives.

00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:05.500
They've got to be smart animals.

00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:06.700
They've got to be social.

00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:07.700
They've got to be smart.

00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:08.908
Why do they have to be smart?

00:37:08.908 --> 00:37:10.610
Because they have
to remember, this

00:37:10.610 --> 00:37:13.880
is the guy who owes me a
favor from last Thursday.

00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:16.680
They need to be able to
recognize individuals.

00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:19.340
They have to be long lived
enough so that there's

00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:21.670
a chance of interacting
with that individual

00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:24.520
again and establishing
this reciprocity.

00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:26.640
You would thus
predict you would see

00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:30.350
systems of reciprocal
altruism only in long

00:37:30.350 --> 00:37:33.530
lived social vertebrates.

00:37:33.530 --> 00:37:37.780
But you see the exact sorts
of things in bacteria.

00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:40.520
You see the exact sort
of things in fungi.

00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:42.670
You see that in all
sorts of other realms.

00:37:42.670 --> 00:37:45.820
You get social bacteria,
colonizing bacteria.

00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:49.040
And where what you might
get are two clonal lines

00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:50.380
that are together.

00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:54.460
In other words, two
genetically-- two lines,

00:37:54.460 --> 00:37:56.540
each of which is,
all the bacteria

00:37:56.540 --> 00:37:57.870
have the same genetic makeup.

00:37:57.870 --> 00:38:00.900
So think of it as one individual
who's just kind of dispersed.

00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:02.850
Another one who's just
kind of dispersed.

00:38:02.850 --> 00:38:05.300
And they've come
together in something

00:38:05.300 --> 00:38:09.260
called a fruiting body, which
is how bacteria reproduce

00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:10.080
or whatever.

00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:13.730
And there's two parts
to a fruiting body.

00:38:13.730 --> 00:38:15.730
There's one which
is the stalk, which

00:38:15.730 --> 00:38:17.680
attaches to something or other.

00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:20.880
And then there is the
part that actually fruits.

00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:23.589
So you want to be in
the fruiting part,

00:38:23.589 --> 00:38:25.630
because that's the part
that actually reproduces,

00:38:25.630 --> 00:38:28.470
and the stalk is doing
all the work there.

00:38:28.470 --> 00:38:32.470
And what you see is
attempts at cheating.

00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:34.510
Attempts at one of
these strains trying

00:38:34.510 --> 00:38:37.440
to disproportionately wind
up in the fruiting part,

00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:39.860
and what you also
see is, the next time

00:38:39.860 --> 00:38:43.340
around, this other strain
will not cooperate with it.

00:38:43.340 --> 00:38:45.960
Will not form a social colony.

00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:48.810
So that's getting played off
at the level of single cell

00:38:48.810 --> 00:38:51.480
organisms forming
big social colonies.

00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:52.910
Getting played at that level.

00:38:52.910 --> 00:38:56.150
Yes, as we will see,
reciprocal altruism

00:38:56.150 --> 00:38:58.600
works most readily
in big, smart, long

00:38:58.600 --> 00:38:59.820
lived social beasts.

00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:03.830
But it can occur in
all sorts of systems.

00:39:03.830 --> 00:39:08.790
What it's built around is
reciprocal cooperation.

00:39:08.790 --> 00:39:11.770
And intrinsic in that it
is another motivation going

00:39:11.770 --> 00:39:12.270
on there.

00:39:12.270 --> 00:39:14.670
Not just to involve the
reciprocal relationship

00:39:14.670 --> 00:39:17.420
with a non-relative, and
many hands, and light tasks,

00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:18.090
and all of that.

00:39:18.090 --> 00:39:21.630
But also, whenever
possible, to cheat.

00:39:21.630 --> 00:39:24.570
To take advantage of
the other individual.

00:39:24.570 --> 00:39:26.920
And thus, another
key facet of it

00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:29.700
is to be very good at
detecting when somebody

00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:31.630
is cheating against you.

00:39:31.630 --> 00:39:34.760
To be vigilant about
cheating in what

00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:38.850
would otherwise be a stable,
reciprocal relationship.

00:39:38.850 --> 00:39:42.020
And an awful lot
of social behavior

00:39:42.020 --> 00:39:44.710
is built around
animals either trying

00:39:44.710 --> 00:39:47.600
to get away with something
or spotting somebody else

00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:48.700
doing the same.

00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:49.850
An example of it.

00:39:49.850 --> 00:39:52.920
There is a test that's used
in evolutionary psychology

00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:55.730
where you are given this
very complicated story,

00:39:55.730 --> 00:39:58.280
or another version of a
complicated story, where

00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:01.217
somebody promises if you do
this, you'll get this reward.

00:40:01.217 --> 00:40:03.550
But if you do that, you're
going to get this punishment.

00:40:03.550 --> 00:40:05.250
And really complex.

00:40:05.250 --> 00:40:07.830
And one outcome,
the outcome of it

00:40:07.830 --> 00:40:10.570
is, the person isn't
supposed to get rewarded.

00:40:10.570 --> 00:40:13.740
But the individual
decides to reward them.

00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:15.720
Spontaneous act of kindness.

00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:17.370
In another
circumstance, the person

00:40:17.370 --> 00:40:19.720
is the individual who is
supposed to get rewarded,

00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:21.930
and instead, they get punished.

00:40:21.930 --> 00:40:23.500
A cheater in that case.

00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:25.970
And amid these
convoluted stories,

00:40:25.970 --> 00:40:29.860
people are much
better-- 75% to 25%--

00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:32.940
are much better at detecting
when cheating has gone

00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:36.660
on in the story than when a
random act of kindness has gone

00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:37.350
on.

00:40:37.350 --> 00:40:39.780
We are more attuned to
picking up cheating.

00:40:39.780 --> 00:40:42.940
And remarkably, some
very subtle studies

00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:44.690
have been done
with chimps showing

00:40:44.690 --> 00:40:46.750
that chimps have the same bias.

00:40:46.750 --> 00:40:48.550
They are much
better at picking up

00:40:48.550 --> 00:40:52.160
social interactions involving
cheating than ones that

00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:55.390
involve spontaneous altruism.

00:40:55.390 --> 00:40:59.430
So you see here, this
balance between cooperation,

00:40:59.430 --> 00:41:01.480
reciprocal, even
among non-relatives.

00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:03.100
And that's great,
but you should cheat

00:41:03.100 --> 00:41:04.350
when you can get away with it.

00:41:04.350 --> 00:41:06.200
But you should be
vigilant against cheaters.

00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:08.210
And what, of course,
it comes down to then

00:41:08.210 --> 00:41:12.210
is tic-tac-toe and giraffe
hearts and all of that.

00:41:12.210 --> 00:41:16.560
What is the optimal strategy
in a particular social species

00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:18.020
for a particular individual.

00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:19.930
What is the optimal strategy.

00:41:19.930 --> 00:41:23.780
When do you cooperate
and when do you cheat.

00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:27.360
When do you defect on the
cooperative relationship

00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:28.390
you've had.

00:41:28.390 --> 00:41:31.230
And this introduces
us to a whole world

00:41:31.230 --> 00:41:35.510
of mathematics built around
what is called game theory.

00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:39.170
The notion that there are
games, formal games, that

00:41:39.170 --> 00:41:43.180
have mathematically
optimal strategies,

00:41:43.180 --> 00:41:46.170
or multiple strategies,
multi-equilibrium.

00:41:46.170 --> 00:41:48.110
And a whole world
of research has

00:41:48.110 --> 00:41:52.160
been built around them in
terms of when to cooperate

00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:54.220
and when to defect.

00:41:54.220 --> 00:41:55.990
So game theory stuff.

00:41:55.990 --> 00:41:59.580
This was starting off
in a world of people

00:41:59.580 --> 00:42:02.910
studying economics, and
negotiation, and diplomacy,

00:42:02.910 --> 00:42:03.820
and all of that.

00:42:03.820 --> 00:42:06.540
And that was a whole world
built around this logic

00:42:06.540 --> 00:42:09.080
of when do you cooperate,
when do you cheat.

00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:11.370
And what came out of
there were all sorts

00:42:11.370 --> 00:42:15.420
of models of how to optimize
behavior in terms of that.

00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:19.160
And the building block, sort of
the fruit fly of game theory,

00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:23.050
is a game called the
prisoner's dilemma.

00:42:23.050 --> 00:42:26.950
Prisoner's dilemma, sort of
cutting to-- sort of getting

00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:27.880
rid of the details.

00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:31.740
Two individuals are
prisoners, and they escape,

00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:33.440
and they're both captured.

00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:35.970
And they're
interrogated separately.

00:42:35.970 --> 00:42:39.260
And both of them refuse to
talk, that's great for them.

00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:41.520
If they both squeal,
they both get punished.

00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:43.731
If one of them is able to
squeal on the other one,

00:42:43.731 --> 00:42:44.730
they get a great reward.

00:42:44.730 --> 00:42:46.730
If the other one--
what you get formally

00:42:46.730 --> 00:42:49.560
are four possible outcomes.

00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:54.360
Both individuals
cooperate, both individuals

00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:59.360
cheat against each other,
individual A cooperates and B

00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:03.710
cheats, individual B
cooperates and A cheats.

00:43:03.710 --> 00:43:05.330
And what you get in
prisoner's dilemma

00:43:05.330 --> 00:43:07.400
is a formal payoff for each.

00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:10.670
What gives you the
greatest payoff, stabbing

00:43:10.670 --> 00:43:12.210
the other guy in the back.

00:43:12.210 --> 00:43:14.360
You cheat and they cooperate.

00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:17.610
You have exploited them, you
have taken advantage of them,

00:43:17.610 --> 00:43:18.920
isn't that wonderful.

00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:22.290
That's the highest payoff
in prisoner dilemma games.

00:43:22.290 --> 00:43:26.800
Second highest payoff,
you both cooperate.

00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:29.074
Third highest payoff--
which is beginning

00:43:29.074 --> 00:43:31.740
to not count as a payoff, but in
a lot of the games, this set up

00:43:31.740 --> 00:43:34.030
is the start of
punishment-- both of you

00:43:34.030 --> 00:43:36.640
cheat on each other.

00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:40.820
Fourth worst possible
payoff is you're the sucker.

00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:42.740
You cooperate, and
the other individual

00:43:42.740 --> 00:43:44.570
stabs you in the back.

00:43:44.570 --> 00:43:46.290
So what the prisoner's
dilemma game

00:43:46.290 --> 00:43:50.670
is set up these circumstances
where individuals will play

00:43:50.670 --> 00:43:54.430
versions of this against each
other with varying rewards

00:43:54.430 --> 00:43:56.780
and that sort of thing,
and parameters that we will

00:43:56.780 --> 00:43:58.340
look at in a lot of detail.

00:43:58.340 --> 00:44:01.510
And seeing when is it
optimal to cooperate,

00:44:01.510 --> 00:44:03.910
when is it optimal to cheat.

00:44:03.910 --> 00:44:05.590
When would you do this.

00:44:05.590 --> 00:44:07.740
So you've got examples
of this, and this

00:44:07.740 --> 00:44:09.390
was the building block.

00:44:09.390 --> 00:44:12.010
And what anyone would
say looking at this is,

00:44:12.010 --> 00:44:13.230
it's obvious.

00:44:13.230 --> 00:44:15.680
What you want to
do is, in some way,

00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:18.880
rationally maximize your payoff.

00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:22.490
This whole world
of Homo economists,

00:44:22.490 --> 00:44:25.550
the notion of humans as being
purely rational decision

00:44:25.550 --> 00:44:26.190
makers.

00:44:26.190 --> 00:44:29.520
And what you begin to see in
this world of game theory is,

00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:31.846
there is anything
but that going on.

00:44:31.846 --> 00:44:33.470
Later in the course,
we're going to see

00:44:33.470 --> 00:44:35.170
something very interesting.

00:44:35.170 --> 00:44:38.320
People playing prisoner's
dilemma games inside a brain

00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:40.760
scanner, looking at a
part of the brain that

00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:42.990
has a lot to do with pleasure.

00:44:42.990 --> 00:44:45.710
And what you see
is, some individuals

00:44:45.710 --> 00:44:48.580
activate that part of the brain
when they have successfully

00:44:48.580 --> 00:44:50.470
stabbed the other
guy in the back.

00:44:50.470 --> 00:44:54.080
Some individuals activate it
when they have both cooperated.

00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:56.520
And there's a big
gender difference

00:44:56.520 --> 00:44:57.630
as to which circumstance.

00:44:57.630 --> 00:44:58.470
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:58.470 --> 00:45:01.107
So you just guess which
one is going on there.

00:45:01.107 --> 00:45:02.690
We're going to see
a number of studies

00:45:02.690 --> 00:45:05.070
like that coming down the line.

00:45:05.070 --> 00:45:06.870
So the question
becomes, how do you

00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:10.010
optimize prisoner dilemma play?

00:45:10.010 --> 00:45:11.970
And what emerged
at that time was

00:45:11.970 --> 00:45:15.210
the notion of all sorts of
theoretical models and stuff.

00:45:15.210 --> 00:45:18.240
And then in the 1970s,
there was an economist

00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:21.240
at University of Michigan
named Robert Axelrod who

00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:23.760
revolutionized the entire field.

00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:27.600
What he did was he took
some paleolithic computer

00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:29.980
and programmed in how the
prisoner's dilemma would

00:45:29.980 --> 00:45:31.010
be played.

00:45:31.010 --> 00:45:34.760
And he could program in as
if there were two players.

00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:39.130
And he could program in what
each one's strategy would be.

00:45:39.130 --> 00:45:42.900
And what he then did was, he
wrote to all of his buddies

00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:46.580
and all of his mathematician
friends and prize fighters

00:45:46.580 --> 00:45:50.910
and theologians and serial
murderers and Nobel Peace Prize

00:45:50.910 --> 00:45:52.490
winners, and in
each case, explained

00:45:52.490 --> 00:45:55.970
what was up and saying,
what strategy would you use

00:45:55.970 --> 00:45:58.020
in a prisoner's dilemma game?

00:45:58.020 --> 00:46:00.010
And he gets them all
back, and he programs

00:46:00.010 --> 00:46:01.380
all these different versions.

00:46:01.380 --> 00:46:04.200
And he runs a round
robin tournament.

00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:07.320
Every strategy is paired
against every other strategy

00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:08.430
at one point or other.

00:46:08.430 --> 00:46:10.470
And you look at
what the payoff is.

00:46:10.470 --> 00:46:14.400
You ask, which is the
most optimal strategy.

00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:18.000
And out of it,
shockingly to everyone--

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:21.590
because this was a computer
teaching us optimizing

00:46:21.590 --> 00:46:25.540
human behavior-- out of it
came one simple strategy that

00:46:25.540 --> 00:46:27.320
always out-competed the others.

00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:29.720
This is people sitting
there, probabilistic ones

00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:33.880
as to when to cooperate, and
lunar cycles as to what to do.

00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:38.980
The one that always won
is now called tit for tat.

00:46:38.980 --> 00:46:42.120
You start off cooperating
in the very first round

00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:43.300
with the individual.

00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:45.670
You cooperate.

00:46:45.670 --> 00:46:49.170
If the individual has cooperated
with you in that round,

00:46:49.170 --> 00:46:51.300
you cooperate in the next round.

00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:53.410
And you cooperate,
cooperate, as long

00:46:53.410 --> 00:46:55.120
as the other
individual cooperates.

00:46:55.120 --> 00:46:58.000
But as soon as there is a round
where the individual cheats

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:02.160
against you, you cheat
against them the next time.

00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:04.600
If they cheated at
you that time also,

00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:06.240
you cheat against
them the next time.

00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:08.590
If they go back to
cooperating, you

00:47:08.590 --> 00:47:11.530
go back to cooperating
the next time.

00:47:11.530 --> 00:47:13.540
You have this tit
for tat strategy.

00:47:13.540 --> 00:47:16.210
In the absence of somebody
stabbing you in the back,

00:47:16.210 --> 00:47:18.020
you will always cooperate.

00:47:18.020 --> 00:47:20.650
And what they found
was, run these hundreds

00:47:20.650 --> 00:47:24.040
of thousands of versions of
these round robin tournaments,

00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:27.240
and tit for tat was the
one that was most optimal,

00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:29.880
to begin to use a
word that is not just

00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:31.320
going to be a metaphor.

00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:34.330
Tit for tat always drove
the other strategies

00:47:34.330 --> 00:47:36.780
into extinction.

00:47:36.780 --> 00:47:40.770
And what you wound up seeing
is this optimized strategy.

00:47:40.770 --> 00:47:44.160
And it was very clear why
tit for tat worked so well.

00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:46.320
Number one, it was nice.

00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:48.170
You start off cooperating.

00:47:48.170 --> 00:47:52.590
Number two, it retaliates if
you do something crummy to it.

00:47:52.590 --> 00:47:55.440
Number three, it is forgiving.

00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:57.370
If you go back to cooperating.

00:47:57.370 --> 00:48:00.310
Number four, it's
clear cut in its play.

00:48:00.310 --> 00:48:02.570
It's not some
probabilistic thing.

00:48:02.570 --> 00:48:05.400
What you get, then,
with tit for tat is,

00:48:05.400 --> 00:48:08.270
suppose you're playing three
rounds with another individual.

00:48:08.270 --> 00:48:09.930
You both cooperate
the first one,

00:48:09.930 --> 00:48:11.430
you both cooperate the next one.

00:48:11.430 --> 00:48:13.030
You're playing tit
for tat strategy,

00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:14.250
so you cooperate on this one.

00:48:14.250 --> 00:48:17.100
And they stab you in the back,
and you can't get back at them,

00:48:17.100 --> 00:48:18.870
because this is the last round.

00:48:18.870 --> 00:48:21.610
What you'll see is, under
lots of circumstances,

00:48:21.610 --> 00:48:24.470
tit for tat is disadvantageous.

00:48:24.470 --> 00:48:27.660
But what the soundbite is
about it is, tit for tat

00:48:27.660 --> 00:48:30.800
may lose the battles,
but it wins all the wars.

00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:34.520
This pattern of being nice,
but being retaliatory, being

00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:37.070
forgiving, and being
clear in the rules,

00:48:37.070 --> 00:48:41.890
drives all the other
strategies into extinction.

00:48:41.890 --> 00:48:44.400
OK, at this point my
alarm just went off,

00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:46.370
which was to remind
me to ask somebody

00:48:46.370 --> 00:48:51.800
who is wearing a life vest-- is
somebody wearing a life vest?

00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:53.420
[INAUDIBLE]

00:48:53.420 --> 00:48:54.760
Over there.

00:48:54.760 --> 00:48:56.468
Where are you?

00:48:56.468 --> 00:48:57.780
She just left.

00:48:57.780 --> 00:48:58.822
She left.

00:48:58.822 --> 00:48:59.780
Isn't that interesting?

00:48:59.780 --> 00:49:02.340
Somebody put me up to
having to ask this person,

00:49:02.340 --> 00:49:03.940
why are you wearing a life vest?

00:49:03.940 --> 00:49:05.830
And apparently the
answer she would give

00:49:05.830 --> 00:49:09.510
was going to free all sorts of
captives in some rebel group

00:49:09.510 --> 00:49:11.051
in Colombia.

00:49:11.051 --> 00:49:12.310
And she fled.

00:49:12.310 --> 00:49:14.014
OK, what that does is--

00:49:14.014 --> 00:49:16.070
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:16.070 --> 00:49:18.340
I don't know what that says
about reciprocal altruism.

00:49:18.340 --> 00:49:21.760
But what that says also
is, after I do a summary,

00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:22.546
don't make a move.

00:49:22.546 --> 00:49:23.920
We will have a
five minute break.

00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:25.570
So what do we have
at this point,

00:49:25.570 --> 00:49:29.180
we have the first building
block of optimizing

00:49:29.180 --> 00:49:32.370
the evolution of behavior,
like optimizing giraffe hearts.

00:49:32.370 --> 00:49:35.710
First piece, you don't behave
for the good of the species.

00:49:35.710 --> 00:49:38.100
Individual selection,
passing on as many copies

00:49:38.100 --> 00:49:39.790
of your own genes as possible.

00:49:39.790 --> 00:49:43.090
Sometimes a chicken is an egg's
way of making another egg,

00:49:43.090 --> 00:49:44.510
he says triumphantly.

00:49:44.510 --> 00:49:47.180
Building block number
two, kin selection.

00:49:47.180 --> 00:49:50.380
Some of the time, the best way
to pass on copies of your genes

00:49:50.380 --> 00:49:52.780
is by way of helping relatives.

00:49:52.780 --> 00:49:55.610
Kin selection, with the
mathematical fierceness

00:49:55.610 --> 00:49:57.940
of degree of
relatedness driving it.

00:49:57.940 --> 00:50:01.050
Piece three, sometimes
what's most advantageous

00:50:01.050 --> 00:50:03.650
is to cooperate, even
with non-relatives,

00:50:03.650 --> 00:50:06.580
but with the rules of
it has to be reciprocal

00:50:06.580 --> 00:50:08.470
and you have to
cheat when possible.

00:50:08.470 --> 00:50:10.400
You have to be on
guard against cheaters.

00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:13.640
And as we've just seen, game
theory, prisoner's dilemma,

00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:17.590
beginning to formalize
optimal strategies for that.

00:50:17.590 --> 00:50:20.280
OK, let's take a
five minute break.

00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:23.110
But promise you will
come back if you go out,

00:50:23.110 --> 00:50:25.630
and everyone won't wander off.

00:50:25.630 --> 00:50:31.085
Altruism [INAUDIBLE] game
theory as being a form or way

00:50:31.085 --> 00:50:34.690
to maximize that behavior
in a very artificial realm,

00:50:34.690 --> 00:50:35.910
but stay tuned.

00:50:35.910 --> 00:50:38.300
Prisoner's dilemma
as the building block

00:50:38.300 --> 00:50:40.570
of how to do this amid
lots of other types

00:50:40.570 --> 00:50:41.760
of games that are used.

00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:44.200
But prisoner's dilemma
is the most basic one.

00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:47.850
And that round robin tournament,
that computer simulation,

00:50:47.850 --> 00:50:50.800
Axelrod asking all his
buddies to tell him

00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:53.760
what strategy would you use,
run them against each other,

00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:55.450
and out comes tit for tat.

00:50:55.450 --> 00:51:00.230
Tit for tat drives all the
others into extinction.

00:51:00.230 --> 00:51:02.260
However, there is
a vulnerability

00:51:02.260 --> 00:51:19.720
in tit for tat,
which is-- OK, so.

00:51:19.720 --> 00:51:23.110
We have the technical way of
showing prisoner's dilemma

00:51:23.110 --> 00:51:23.830
play.

00:51:23.830 --> 00:51:27.340
And first round, both
individuals are cooperating.

00:51:27.340 --> 00:51:30.150
Second round, both
individuals are cooperating.

00:51:30.150 --> 00:51:33.290
Third round, this one
cheats-- those are fangs.

00:51:33.290 --> 00:51:35.410
This one cheats and
this one cooperates.

00:51:35.410 --> 00:51:40.200
So the next round, this
one now cheats and this one

00:51:40.200 --> 00:51:42.580
goes back to cooperating,
and we've just

00:51:42.580 --> 00:51:46.070
gotten through a scary thing
that tit for tat solves,

00:51:46.070 --> 00:51:47.510
and it's great.

00:51:47.510 --> 00:51:48.610
Wonderful.

00:51:48.610 --> 00:51:52.660
What if, though, your
system is not 100% perfect.

00:51:52.660 --> 00:51:54.570
What if there's
a the possibility

00:51:54.570 --> 00:51:59.430
of a mistake being made, of
sending the wrong signal.

00:51:59.430 --> 00:52:03.410
What if there's the possibility
of noise in the communication

00:52:03.410 --> 00:52:04.060
system.

00:52:04.060 --> 00:52:06.310
And at some point,
an individual who

00:52:06.310 --> 00:52:09.260
does a cooperative
behavior, thanks to a glitch

00:52:09.260 --> 00:52:14.500
in the system, it is read
as having been defection.

00:52:14.500 --> 00:52:16.950
So what happens as a result?

00:52:16.950 --> 00:52:21.070
This individual-- forget it.

00:52:21.070 --> 00:52:26.060
OK, what happens as a result.
The individual who cooperated,

00:52:26.060 --> 00:52:28.820
but somehow the message
got through as cheating,

00:52:28.820 --> 00:52:30.030
they don't know.

00:52:30.030 --> 00:52:33.150
Something got lost in the wires
between them in translation.

00:52:33.150 --> 00:52:35.550
The other individual
was saying whoa,

00:52:35.550 --> 00:52:37.590
that individual
cheated against me.

00:52:37.590 --> 00:52:39.460
I'm going to cheat
in the next round.

00:52:39.460 --> 00:52:41.920
So along comes the next
round, and that individual

00:52:41.920 --> 00:52:43.179
cheats against them.

00:52:43.179 --> 00:52:44.970
This one who's cooperating,
because they've

00:52:44.970 --> 00:52:46.146
been cooperating all along.

00:52:46.146 --> 00:52:47.520
They don't know
about this error.

00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:50.920
And they say whoa, that person
just cheated against me.

00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:52.697
I'm going to cheat
in the next round.

00:52:52.697 --> 00:52:54.030
So they cheat in the next round.

00:52:54.030 --> 00:52:56.870
This one says whoa, they
just cheated another time,

00:52:56.870 --> 00:52:58.220
again and again and again.

00:52:58.220 --> 00:53:02.520
And what you get is a seesaw
pattern for the rest of time.

00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:05.870
You've just wiped out
50% of the cooperation.

00:53:05.870 --> 00:53:08.990
And what you've got is
tit for tat strategies

00:53:08.990 --> 00:53:11.800
are vulnerable to signal error.

00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:14.080
That's something that soon
came out in these studies

00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:15.680
of Axelrod's.

00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:18.940
When I was a kid, there was
like one of these thriller

00:53:18.940 --> 00:53:22.930
books I remember reading where
there's a glitch in the system.

00:53:22.930 --> 00:53:25.870
And at the time, the
mean scary Soviet Union

00:53:25.870 --> 00:53:29.620
launched a missile that--
no, it was the United States.

00:53:29.620 --> 00:53:31.420
The United States,
by accident, launched

00:53:31.420 --> 00:53:34.850
a missile, a nuclear weapon,
where they didn't mean to.

00:53:34.850 --> 00:53:39.050
Some cockroach chewed through
a wire some place or other.

00:53:39.050 --> 00:53:43.630
And the missile went off, and
wound up destroying Moscow.

00:53:43.630 --> 00:53:45.810
And oh my god, we had
a cooperative system

00:53:45.810 --> 00:53:49.430
of mutually restraint of
aggression, all of that.

00:53:49.430 --> 00:53:52.670
And thanks to a signal
error, a cheating signal

00:53:52.670 --> 00:53:54.250
was accidentally sent off.

00:53:54.250 --> 00:53:55.820
And how did the book end?

00:53:55.820 --> 00:53:57.290
A tit for tat response.

00:53:57.290 --> 00:54:00.960
In order to avoid
thermonuclear wasteland,

00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:04.990
the Soviet Union was
allowed to destroy New York.

00:54:04.990 --> 00:54:07.790
All right, so that
shows exactly how

00:54:07.790 --> 00:54:10.630
you could then get into
a see-sawing thing,

00:54:10.630 --> 00:54:14.370
simply by way of if the
system has any vulnerability

00:54:14.370 --> 00:54:15.610
to signal error.

00:54:15.610 --> 00:54:18.270
So it soon became clear,
as soon as Axelrod

00:54:18.270 --> 00:54:21.400
began to introduce the
possibility of signal errors,

00:54:21.400 --> 00:54:25.680
that tit for tat didn't work as
well as another strategy, one

00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:27.950
that quickly came
to the forefront.

00:54:27.950 --> 00:54:33.580
And that one-- for
some strange reason,

00:54:33.580 --> 00:54:35.940
that's the way it's shown.

00:54:35.940 --> 00:54:40.320
That one was called
forgiving tit for tat.

00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:42.570
What happens with
forgiving tit for tat?

00:54:42.570 --> 00:54:45.244
The usual rule, like tit
for tat, if you cooperate,

00:54:45.244 --> 00:54:46.910
if they cooperate,
you always cooperate.

00:54:46.910 --> 00:54:50.130
If they cheat against you, you
punish them in the next round.

00:54:50.130 --> 00:54:52.020
Exactly the same
thing as tit for tat,

00:54:52.020 --> 00:54:55.450
but oh no, what if there's
a signal error in the system

00:54:55.450 --> 00:54:58.590
and you've gotten caught in
one of these horrible seesawing

00:54:58.590 --> 00:54:59.170
things.

00:54:59.170 --> 00:55:02.100
What forgiving tit
for tat does is,

00:55:02.100 --> 00:55:04.350
we'll have a rule, for
example, that if we

00:55:04.350 --> 00:55:07.780
see saw like this
five times in a row,

00:55:07.780 --> 00:55:10.330
I will forego cheating
the next time.

00:55:10.330 --> 00:55:12.010
And instead, I'll cooperate.

00:55:12.010 --> 00:55:14.610
And that will get
things back on track.

00:55:14.610 --> 00:55:18.780
I am willing to be
forgiving in one round

00:55:18.780 --> 00:55:21.600
in order to
re-establish cooperation

00:55:21.600 --> 00:55:23.940
after the signal error came in.

00:55:23.940 --> 00:55:26.080
And that one-- as
soon as you introduce

00:55:26.080 --> 00:55:29.060
the possibility of signal
error, that one out-competes

00:55:29.060 --> 00:55:30.530
tit for tat.

00:55:30.530 --> 00:55:32.650
Because it makes perfect sense.

00:55:32.650 --> 00:55:36.050
It's a great way of
solving that problem.

00:55:36.050 --> 00:55:38.280
So that was terrific.

00:55:38.280 --> 00:55:40.220
Tit for tat with the
ability to forgive,

00:55:40.220 --> 00:55:44.096
and what you would then see is
variability, how many of these

00:55:44.096 --> 00:55:46.540
do you need to go through
before you forgive,

00:55:46.540 --> 00:55:49.450
what's the optimal number
of see-sawings, all of that.

00:55:49.450 --> 00:55:53.200
So a whole world of optimizing
how soon you're forgiving.

00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:56.270
Nonetheless, the general
theme being forgiving tit

00:55:56.270 --> 00:55:59.890
for tat out-competes tit for tat
when you can have signal error.

00:55:59.890 --> 00:56:02.170
But there is a vulnerability.

00:56:02.170 --> 00:56:04.960
There is a vulnerability
here to this one, which

00:56:04.960 --> 00:56:07.270
is, you could be exploited.

00:56:07.270 --> 00:56:09.970
If you're playing against,
for example, a tit for tatter,

00:56:09.970 --> 00:56:12.360
or all sorts of other
strategies, where

00:56:12.360 --> 00:56:16.570
they don't have forgiving
strings of defection

00:56:16.570 --> 00:56:18.517
and you do, what's
going to happen

00:56:18.517 --> 00:56:20.600
is you're going to keep
going back to cooperating,

00:56:20.600 --> 00:56:23.020
they're going to keep
stabbing you in your back.

00:56:23.020 --> 00:56:27.500
Forgiving tit for tat is
vulnerable to exploitation

00:56:27.500 --> 00:56:30.070
playing against
individual players that

00:56:30.070 --> 00:56:32.790
don't have forgiveness in them.

00:56:32.790 --> 00:56:38.260
So what soon became apparent was
an even better strategy, which

00:56:38.260 --> 00:56:48.880
is you start off with
a tit for tat strategy.

00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:51.520
Which is, you are
punitive, you are

00:56:51.520 --> 00:56:55.100
retaliatory amid being
forgiving, clear and nice

00:56:55.100 --> 00:56:55.820
initially.

00:56:55.820 --> 00:56:59.020
You are willing to punish, and
you cannot be exploited in this

00:56:59.020 --> 00:57:00.290
way.

00:57:00.290 --> 00:57:04.170
If and only if you have gone
whatever number of rounds

00:57:04.170 --> 00:57:07.470
without the other individual
ever cheating on you, if you've

00:57:07.470 --> 00:57:09.760
gone long enough
without that happening,

00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:12.380
you switch over to
forgiving tit for tat.

00:57:12.380 --> 00:57:13.760
What is that?

00:57:13.760 --> 00:57:16.050
That's deciding
you trust somebody.

00:57:16.050 --> 00:57:18.140
You've had enough
interactions with them

00:57:18.140 --> 00:57:20.060
that you are willing
to trust them.

00:57:20.060 --> 00:57:24.890
This is the transition from
pure rational optimizing

00:57:24.890 --> 00:57:28.990
to switching over, forgiveness
coming in there protects you

00:57:28.990 --> 00:57:30.280
from signal error.

00:57:30.280 --> 00:57:34.190
And of course, now, a whole
world of how many rounds do you

00:57:34.190 --> 00:57:36.700
need to do this before
you switch that as to what

00:57:36.700 --> 00:57:38.350
the optimal deal with that is.

00:57:38.350 --> 00:57:41.380
But again, this is a
way of transitioning

00:57:41.380 --> 00:57:44.280
to solve the problem
of signal error,

00:57:44.280 --> 00:57:48.590
but forgiving too readily
and being taken advantage of.

00:57:48.590 --> 00:57:53.390
Soon, another strategy appeared,
which was called Pavlov.

00:57:53.390 --> 00:57:56.390
And those of you who
know Pavlovian psychology

00:57:56.390 --> 00:57:59.340
will see that this, in fact,
has nothing whatsoever to do

00:57:59.340 --> 00:58:02.500
with Pavlovian psychology, and
I don't know why they did that.

00:58:02.500 --> 00:58:04.050
But they thought it
was kind of cool.

00:58:04.050 --> 00:58:07.870
But the rule was
remember, if you

00:58:07.870 --> 00:58:10.790
stab the other guy in the back,
you get a bunch of points.

00:58:10.790 --> 00:58:13.870
If you both cooperate, you
get points, not as many.

00:58:13.870 --> 00:58:16.870
If you both cheat,
you lose some points.

00:58:16.870 --> 00:58:20.130
If you're taken advantage
of, you lose a lot of points.

00:58:20.130 --> 00:58:23.260
So two outcomes you gain,
two outcomes you lose.

00:58:23.260 --> 00:58:27.130
In Pavlov, the simple rule
is when I do something,

00:58:27.130 --> 00:58:30.660
if I get points, if I get
some degree of reward,

00:58:30.660 --> 00:58:33.010
I do it again the next time.

00:58:33.010 --> 00:58:36.350
If I get rewarded in either of
the first two types of payoffs,

00:58:36.350 --> 00:58:39.390
I do the same thing again.

00:58:39.390 --> 00:58:44.080
And the other part, of course,
is, if I play my strategy

00:58:44.080 --> 00:58:48.100
and I lose one of the
two bottom outcomes,

00:58:48.100 --> 00:58:51.310
I switch to the other
strategy the next time.

00:58:51.310 --> 00:58:55.000
And what you see is that
can establish very good tit

00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:55.780
for tat stuff.

00:58:55.780 --> 00:58:58.290
But if you sit and
spend hours tonight

00:58:58.290 --> 00:59:01.000
with a long roll of
toilet paper and playing

00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:02.590
out all the rounds
of it, you will

00:59:02.590 --> 00:59:06.200
see what Pavlov allows
you to do is exploit

00:59:06.200 --> 00:59:08.250
somebody else who is forgiving.

00:59:08.250 --> 00:59:10.930
So Pavlov goes along
just fine with this.

00:59:10.930 --> 00:59:14.580
And as long as Pavlov continues,
whenever they switch over

00:59:14.580 --> 00:59:16.940
to a forgiving tit
for tat, Pavlov

00:59:16.940 --> 00:59:19.770
will out-compete them,
because Pavlov exploits.

00:59:22.340 --> 00:59:26.330
What then emerged was just
zillions of people studying

00:59:26.330 --> 00:59:28.220
all sorts of games like this.

00:59:28.220 --> 00:59:32.050
There's other ones, ultimatum
game, there's a trust game.

00:59:32.050 --> 00:59:34.520
It's the same notion
of business there,

00:59:34.520 --> 00:59:37.460
which is you choose to
cooperate, you choose to cheat,

00:59:37.460 --> 00:59:39.240
what's the optimal outcome.

00:59:39.240 --> 00:59:42.450
There are mathematically optimal
outcomes that you can use,

00:59:42.450 --> 00:59:44.670
and you run all of it
against the computer,

00:59:44.670 --> 00:59:48.120
and you get the optimization
popping out the other end.

00:59:48.120 --> 00:59:49.130
Wonderful.

00:59:49.130 --> 00:59:52.210
So there's Axelrod and
his buddies using terms

00:59:52.210 --> 00:59:54.360
like oh, this
strategy will drive

00:59:54.360 --> 00:59:56.400
the other one into extinction.

00:59:56.400 --> 01:00:00.020
Or this strategy works,
but if you program in

01:00:00.020 --> 01:00:02.430
that every now and then
there could be a glitch,

01:00:02.430 --> 01:00:04.770
there can be a mutation,
this will be-- they're

01:00:04.770 --> 01:00:09.130
using all this biology jargon,
obviously metaphorically.

01:00:09.130 --> 01:00:11.630
But right around this
point, the biologists

01:00:11.630 --> 01:00:14.000
look at this, who are
just beginning to think

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.990
about the social biology stuff.

01:00:15.990 --> 01:00:19.530
Formal patterns of
optimizing behavior.

01:00:19.530 --> 01:00:23.290
And they say whoa, does
this apply to the behavior

01:00:23.290 --> 01:00:25.060
of real organisms?

01:00:25.060 --> 01:00:28.810
Because at this point, it's just
economists and computer types

01:00:28.810 --> 01:00:31.410
and diplomats learning
when to optimize,

01:00:31.410 --> 01:00:32.560
all that sort of thing.

01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:36.120
Around the time there
was a paper published,

01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:37.380
somewhat before that.

01:00:37.380 --> 01:00:39.836
This is a name nobody
is going to know,

01:00:39.836 --> 01:00:42.720
lost in history, a guy
named Daniel Ellsberg.

01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:46.800
Daniel Ellsberg became
very famous around 1970,

01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:48.840
by he was working
in the Pentagon

01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:52.210
and he stole thousands
of pages of secret files

01:00:52.210 --> 01:00:54.370
there, and gave it
to the New York Times

01:00:54.370 --> 01:00:57.680
showing how utterly
corrupt everything that

01:00:57.680 --> 01:01:00.730
went on behind the scenes was
in getting us into Vietnam.

01:01:00.730 --> 01:01:02.880
Major blowout, all of that.

01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:06.430
He had spent the early part of
his career perfectly happily

01:01:06.430 --> 01:01:10.930
working in the Pentagon for the
military as a game theorist.

01:01:10.930 --> 01:01:13.780
As a game theorist coming
up with optimal patterns.

01:01:13.780 --> 01:01:17.230
And he wrote one paper
called "The Optimal

01:01:17.230 --> 01:01:20.270
Benefits of Perceived Madness".

01:01:20.270 --> 01:01:22.750
What times do you
want your opponent

01:01:22.750 --> 01:01:25.640
to think you are
absolutely out of your mind

01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:27.960
and going to do all
sorts of crazy stuff,

01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:29.610
and where they
wind up cooperating

01:01:29.610 --> 01:01:31.300
to keep you from doing that.

01:01:31.300 --> 01:01:33.730
The advantages of
madness, what's that.

01:01:33.730 --> 01:01:37.320
That's systems where things like
mutually assured destruction

01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:40.630
doesn't work, because you
are willing to set it off.

01:01:40.630 --> 01:01:42.310
The advantages of madness.

01:01:42.310 --> 01:01:45.990
This whole world of people
working on it, mathematicians

01:01:45.990 --> 01:01:47.610
and war strategists.

01:01:47.610 --> 01:01:52.050
And there's the zoologists now
looking at this saying whoa,

01:01:52.050 --> 01:01:53.360
this is cool.

01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:56.280
I wonder if animals
behave that way.

01:01:56.280 --> 01:01:59.220
And that's when people, now
armed with their insights

01:01:59.220 --> 01:02:01.490
into prisoner's dilemma
and tit for tat,

01:02:01.490 --> 01:02:04.650
all this stuff, started to
go and study animals out

01:02:04.650 --> 01:02:08.010
in the wild and see, were
there any examples where

01:02:08.010 --> 01:02:09.480
this happened.

01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:10.440
Yes.

01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:12.860
In all sorts of
interesting realms.

01:02:12.860 --> 01:02:16.090
First example, vampire bats.

01:02:16.090 --> 01:02:18.970
Vampire bats, we are all
set up to be creeped out

01:02:18.970 --> 01:02:20.150
by vampire bats.

01:02:20.150 --> 01:02:23.230
But in actuality, when you
see a vampire bat drinking

01:02:23.230 --> 01:02:25.410
the blood of some
cow or something,

01:02:25.410 --> 01:02:29.740
you are watching a mommy
getting food for her babies.

01:02:29.740 --> 01:02:32.370
Because vampire bat
mothers are not actually

01:02:32.370 --> 01:02:33.890
drinking the blood.

01:02:33.890 --> 01:02:36.010
They're filling up
this throat sack thing,

01:02:36.010 --> 01:02:38.030
and they go back to the
nest and they disgorge

01:02:38.030 --> 01:02:39.780
the blood to feed their babies.

01:02:39.780 --> 01:02:42.570
She's just watching
out for her kids.

01:02:42.570 --> 01:02:45.950
It happens that vampire bats
have an interesting system

01:02:45.950 --> 01:02:49.230
of reciprocal altruism, which
is a whole bunch of females

01:02:49.230 --> 01:02:51.140
will share the same nest.

01:02:51.140 --> 01:02:53.660
Will have all their
kids in there mixed in.

01:02:53.660 --> 01:02:55.710
And these are not
necessarily related,

01:02:55.710 --> 01:02:58.290
so we've just left the
world of kin selection.

01:02:58.290 --> 01:03:00.260
They're not necessarily
related, but they have

01:03:00.260 --> 01:03:02.070
reciprocal altruists system.

01:03:02.070 --> 01:03:05.830
Each female comes in,
disgorges the blood,

01:03:05.830 --> 01:03:07.800
and feeds everybody's babies.

01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:09.450
And they all feed
each other's babies,

01:03:09.450 --> 01:03:10.640
and everything is terrific.

01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:13.810
And they have this blood
vampire commune going there.

01:03:13.810 --> 01:03:17.740
And they've reached a nice
state of stable cooperation.

01:03:17.740 --> 01:03:21.280
Now, make the bats think
that one of the females

01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:23.600
is cheating on them.

01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:26.890
Out comes that female flying off
to find some blood, and instead

01:03:26.890 --> 01:03:29.230
you net her and
get a hold of her,

01:03:29.230 --> 01:03:31.700
and take some
syringe full of air

01:03:31.700 --> 01:03:33.870
and pump up the throat
sack so the throat

01:03:33.870 --> 01:03:36.051
sack is really
full and distended,

01:03:36.051 --> 01:03:37.300
but there's no blood in there.

01:03:37.300 --> 01:03:38.880
You've just pumped
air into there.

01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:40.549
And stick her back
into the nest there.

01:03:40.549 --> 01:03:42.090
And she's just
sitting there happily,

01:03:42.090 --> 01:03:43.464
and the other
females are sitting

01:03:43.464 --> 01:03:46.800
saying look at her, look at
how much blood she's got there.

01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:49.890
I can't believe it, because
she's not feeding our kids.

01:03:49.890 --> 01:03:51.280
She's cheating on us.

01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:53.450
And the next time
they go out to feed,

01:03:53.450 --> 01:03:56.600
the other females
don't feed her kids.

01:03:56.600 --> 01:03:58.310
A tit for tat.

01:03:58.310 --> 01:04:01.150
What you saw here
is an exact example

01:04:01.150 --> 01:04:02.840
of introducing signal error.

01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:05.640
Signal error, in this case,
being some grad student

01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:08.450
pumping up the throat
of some vampire bat

01:04:08.450 --> 01:04:12.380
and showing that they're using
a version of a tit for tat

01:04:12.380 --> 01:04:13.490
strategy.

01:04:13.490 --> 01:04:14.990
Totally amazing.

01:04:14.990 --> 01:04:17.110
People were blown away by this.

01:04:17.110 --> 01:04:19.930
Another example, fish.

01:04:19.930 --> 01:04:23.620
Stickleback fish who, in the
world of animals-- you know,

01:04:23.620 --> 01:04:26.060
bats are probably not some of
the brightest folks around.

01:04:26.060 --> 01:04:29.490
But I don't think sticklebacks
are within light years of them.

01:04:29.490 --> 01:04:32.650
But stickleback fish can
do a tit for tat strategy.

01:04:32.650 --> 01:04:33.550
Here's what you do.

01:04:33.550 --> 01:04:38.440
You have a stickleback
fish in your fish tank,

01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:41.650
and you make the fish
believe that he's

01:04:41.650 --> 01:04:44.240
being attacked by another fish.

01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:44.900
What do you do?

01:04:44.900 --> 01:04:47.900
You put a mirror up against
the edge of the tank there.

01:04:47.900 --> 01:04:49.819
So within a very short
time-- I told you

01:04:49.819 --> 01:04:50.860
they were not that smart.

01:04:50.860 --> 01:04:52.700
So within a very
short time, he's

01:04:52.700 --> 01:04:55.480
lunging forward at
this mirrored thing

01:04:55.480 --> 01:04:58.110
and maintaining his
territory against this guy

01:04:58.110 --> 01:04:59.410
and barely holding on.

01:04:59.410 --> 01:05:02.530
And that other guy is
just-- he doesn't get tired.

01:05:02.530 --> 01:05:04.230
Thank god I don't get tired.

01:05:04.230 --> 01:05:05.810
And they're just going at it.

01:05:05.810 --> 01:05:10.300
And now make him think he
has a cooperative partner.

01:05:10.300 --> 01:05:14.150
Put in a second mirror
that's perpendicular here.

01:05:14.150 --> 01:05:17.460
In other words, he sees
his reflection there.

01:05:17.460 --> 01:05:19.710
And every time he
moves forward, the

01:05:19.710 --> 01:05:22.990
sees that one moving
forward, which is fortunate

01:05:22.990 --> 01:05:25.760
because he's also seeing another
fish coming from that way.

01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:27.635
And he's sitting there
saying, this is great.

01:05:27.635 --> 01:05:30.150
I don't know who this guy is,
but wow, what a team we are.

01:05:30.150 --> 01:05:30.892
[LAUGHTER]

01:05:30.892 --> 01:05:31.850
Doubles, this is great.

01:05:31.850 --> 01:05:33.880
He's in there and the thing
is, it's funny how those two

01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:35.060
guys are so synchronized.

01:05:35.060 --> 01:05:37.590
But whoa, we're holding
them off and we're doing it.

01:05:37.590 --> 01:05:41.180
Now make him think his
cooperating partner is,

01:05:41.180 --> 01:05:43.120
in fact, cheating on him.

01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:45.570
Take the mirror and
angle it back a little

01:05:45.570 --> 01:05:49.120
bit so the reflection
is set back some.

01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:52.430
And what he now sees is
the fish moving forward,

01:05:52.430 --> 01:05:54.560
but not all the way
up to the wall there.

01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:56.200
The fish is hanging back there.

01:05:56.200 --> 01:05:57.610
The fish is cheating.

01:05:57.610 --> 01:06:00.330
And this stickleback is sitting
there saying, in effect,

01:06:00.330 --> 01:06:02.067
that son of a bitch.

01:06:02.067 --> 01:06:03.650
I can't believe he's
doing that to me.

01:06:03.650 --> 01:06:04.983
We've worked together for years.

01:06:04.983 --> 01:06:07.710
I can't believe he's-- oh
he's pretending to go forward.

01:06:07.710 --> 01:06:09.750
But I see he's not
really doing that.

01:06:09.750 --> 01:06:12.540
Fortunately, that guy isn't
coming forward anymore, either.

01:06:12.540 --> 01:06:13.170
Phew.

01:06:13.170 --> 01:06:14.900
But I can't believe
the guy is cheating.

01:06:14.900 --> 01:06:18.420
And the next time you set up
this scenario, the next time

01:06:18.420 --> 01:06:21.320
there's a chance the
stickleback doesn't attack

01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:22.910
its own reflection there.

01:06:22.910 --> 01:06:26.300
It is tit for tatting
against this guy.

01:06:26.300 --> 01:06:29.110
So here we've managed to
set up one of these deals

01:06:29.110 --> 01:06:31.800
within one fish and
carrying it out forever.

01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:34.800
One fish, ultimately with
some very blistered lips.

01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:36.980
Tit for tat, once again.

01:06:36.980 --> 01:06:38.150
Another example.

01:06:38.150 --> 01:06:41.546
This is the most bizarre
one I can imagine, and leads

01:06:41.546 --> 01:06:43.170
to all sorts of
subjects that are going

01:06:43.170 --> 01:06:44.760
to come many lectures from now.

01:06:44.760 --> 01:06:48.440
But there are fish species
that will change sex.

01:06:48.440 --> 01:06:52.220
And they do it under all sorts
of strategic circumstances

01:06:52.220 --> 01:06:54.870
that suddenly begin to fit
into this realm of what

01:06:54.870 --> 01:06:56.210
we've been learning about.

01:06:56.210 --> 01:06:59.390
And you've got one of these
things called black hamlet

01:06:59.390 --> 01:06:59.940
fish.

01:06:59.940 --> 01:07:02.350
And they can change gender.

01:07:02.350 --> 01:07:04.280
So you'll have a
pair of them who

01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:06.520
hang out with each other
of opposite genders,

01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:07.799
and they take turns.

01:07:07.799 --> 01:07:08.840
They flip back and forth.

01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:11.110
For a while, this one's
female, and for a while,

01:07:11.110 --> 01:07:11.860
this one's female.

01:07:11.860 --> 01:07:13.750
And they go back and
forth, and that's great.

01:07:13.750 --> 01:07:15.770
But there's an
inequity there, which

01:07:15.770 --> 01:07:17.530
is that the price
of reproduction

01:07:17.530 --> 01:07:21.240
is greater for the
female than for the male.

01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:22.970
As is the case in
so many species,

01:07:22.970 --> 01:07:25.920
the female doing all
that egg and ovaduct

01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:28.570
and progesterone stuff,
or whatever it is.

01:07:28.570 --> 01:07:31.160
And the male's just got to
come up with some sperm there.

01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:34.250
Doing to reproduction
as a cooperating pair,

01:07:34.250 --> 01:07:35.660
they're not relatives.

01:07:35.660 --> 01:07:39.760
Reciprocal altruism, maximizing
each of their reproductions.

01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:42.200
Whoever's the female
in any given round

01:07:42.200 --> 01:07:44.510
is the one who's paying more.

01:07:44.510 --> 01:07:48.110
What you see are reciprocal
relationships there

01:07:48.110 --> 01:07:50.740
of the fish using tit for tat.

01:07:50.740 --> 01:07:54.300
If you get one fish that
begins to cheat and winds up

01:07:54.300 --> 01:07:56.350
being a male too
much of the time,

01:07:56.350 --> 01:07:58.950
the other fish stops
cooperating with them.

01:07:58.950 --> 01:08:00.780
Again, tit for tat stuff.

01:08:00.780 --> 01:08:04.180
So people were just blown out
of the water at this point,

01:08:04.180 --> 01:08:08.770
seeing whoa, forget rational
human economic thinking,

01:08:08.770 --> 01:08:09.370
all of that.

01:08:09.370 --> 01:08:13.180
You go out into the wild,
and bats and stickleback fish

01:08:13.180 --> 01:08:15.510
and gender switching
fish and all of that,

01:08:15.510 --> 01:08:18.270
they're following some of
the exact same strategies.

01:08:18.270 --> 01:08:20.279
Isn't nature amazing.

01:08:20.279 --> 01:08:21.729
No, nature isn't amazing.

01:08:21.729 --> 01:08:23.840
It's the exact same
logic as saying

01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:26.300
a giraffe has to
have a heart that's

01:08:26.300 --> 01:08:28.130
strong enough to
pump blood to the top

01:08:28.130 --> 01:08:29.540
of the head of a giraffe.

01:08:29.540 --> 01:08:31.250
Or else there
wouldn't be a giraffe.

01:08:31.250 --> 01:08:34.939
And when you look at this realm,
it's applying the same notion.

01:08:34.939 --> 01:08:39.319
This same sort of wind tunnel
of selective optimization

01:08:39.319 --> 01:08:42.050
for behavior-- in this
case, when to cheat,

01:08:42.050 --> 01:08:44.390
when to cooperate--
sculpts something

01:08:44.390 --> 01:08:47.330
that is as optimized
as a giraffe's heart

01:08:47.330 --> 01:08:48.810
being the right size.

01:08:48.810 --> 01:08:50.740
So this made perfect sense.

01:08:50.740 --> 01:08:52.130
Wonderful.

01:08:52.130 --> 01:08:54.740
But then people began to
look a little bit closer,

01:08:54.740 --> 01:08:58.330
and began to see the very
distressing real world

01:08:58.330 --> 01:08:59.700
beginning to creep in there.

01:08:59.700 --> 01:09:01.750
Which were exceptions.

01:09:01.750 --> 01:09:03.080
First exception.

01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:05.560
This was done by a guy named
Craig Packer, University

01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:09.029
of Minnesota, looking
at lions in East Africa.

01:09:09.029 --> 01:09:11.840
What you get is,
typically, prides

01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:15.550
are a whole bunch of relatives,
usually female, sisters,

01:09:15.550 --> 01:09:16.507
nieces, all of that.

01:09:16.507 --> 01:09:18.090
But you will sometimes
get prides that

01:09:18.090 --> 01:09:19.410
are not of close relatives.

01:09:19.410 --> 01:09:23.250
Nonetheless, they will get
reciprocal altruistic things

01:09:23.250 --> 01:09:24.290
going on.

01:09:24.290 --> 01:09:27.090
Lions, in this case,
having the same trick as

01:09:27.090 --> 01:09:28.840
was done on those
vervet monkeys.

01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:32.979
Researcher putting inside
the bush there a speaker,

01:09:32.979 --> 01:09:39.270
and playing the sound of like
400 menacing lions all at once.

01:09:39.270 --> 01:09:42.050
What you're supposed to do
is freak out at that point.

01:09:42.050 --> 01:09:44.569
And all of you need to very
carefully approach and see

01:09:44.569 --> 01:09:46.899
what's going on in that bush.

01:09:46.899 --> 01:09:49.399
So what would happen
in a reciprocal system,

01:09:49.399 --> 01:09:51.680
and everybody does this.

01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:53.700
Or if one time, one
of them cheats on you,

01:09:53.700 --> 01:09:55.680
you push that one
forward the next time.

01:09:55.680 --> 01:09:56.522
Or some such thing.

01:09:56.522 --> 01:09:57.730
That's what you would expect.

01:09:57.730 --> 01:09:59.510
But what he would
begin to notice

01:09:59.510 --> 01:10:03.680
is, in a bunch of these groups,
there'd be one scaredy cat

01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:07.770
lion, one who habitually
stayed behind the others

01:10:07.770 --> 01:10:10.190
and who wasn't punished for it.

01:10:10.190 --> 01:10:12.460
So this produced
this first puzzle

01:10:12.460 --> 01:10:15.910
that oh, sometimes animals
aren't optimizing tit for tat.

01:10:15.910 --> 01:10:19.670
Sometimes animals haven't read
Robert Axelrod's landmark 1972

01:10:19.670 --> 01:10:21.230
paper, that sort of thing.

01:10:21.230 --> 01:10:24.830
And what you suddenly
have is the real world.

01:10:24.830 --> 01:10:27.320
What could be
possible explanations?

01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:31.010
One thing being, maybe they're
not really paying attention.

01:10:31.010 --> 01:10:32.740
Maybe they're not
quite that smart.

01:10:32.740 --> 01:10:35.180
Wait, bacteria are doing
versions of tit for tat.

01:10:35.180 --> 01:10:36.480
What else could be going on?

01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:39.800
Oh, lions interact
in other realms.

01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:44.150
Maybe this individual is
doing very reciprocal stuff,

01:10:44.150 --> 01:10:47.980
forgiving overly altruistic
stuff in some other realm

01:10:47.980 --> 01:10:48.990
of behavior.

01:10:48.990 --> 01:10:52.300
Maybe this lion eats
less of the meat

01:10:52.300 --> 01:10:55.160
and backs off earlier,
or something like that.

01:10:55.160 --> 01:10:59.740
Maybe there's another game
going on simultaneously.

01:10:59.740 --> 01:11:01.880
And this is introducing
the real world

01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:04.670
in which it is not
just two individuals

01:11:04.670 --> 01:11:08.270
sitting there playing prisoner's
dilemma and optimizing.

01:11:08.270 --> 01:11:11.085
You suddenly begin to get
real world complexities coming

01:11:11.085 --> 01:11:11.790
in there.

01:11:11.790 --> 01:11:13.570
And by the time we
get to the lectures,

01:11:13.570 --> 01:11:16.700
way down the line, on
aggression and cooperation,

01:11:16.700 --> 01:11:19.870
what you'll see is things
get really complicated

01:11:19.870 --> 01:11:23.170
when you have individuals
playing games simultaneously.

01:11:23.170 --> 01:11:25.980
The rules that you apply
to one psychologically

01:11:25.980 --> 01:11:28.270
begin to dribble
into the other one.

01:11:28.270 --> 01:11:30.000
All sorts of things like that.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:31.590
It will get very complicated.

01:11:31.590 --> 01:11:34.590
So a first hint there
that, in fact, everything

01:11:34.590 --> 01:11:36.620
doesn't work perfectly
along those lines.

01:11:36.620 --> 01:11:38.460
Here's another version.

01:11:38.460 --> 01:11:41.510
Here's one of the truly
weird species out there,

01:11:41.510 --> 01:11:44.950
something called
the naked mole rat.

01:11:44.950 --> 01:11:47.040
If you ever have
nothing to do and you've

01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:51.190
got Google Image up there, go
spend the evening looking up

01:11:51.190 --> 01:11:53.430
close up pictures
of naked mole rats.

01:11:53.430 --> 01:11:56.140
These are the weirdest
things out there.

01:11:56.140 --> 01:11:58.810
They are the closest
things among the mammals

01:11:58.810 --> 01:12:02.630
to social insects, in terms
of how their colonies work.

01:12:02.630 --> 01:12:04.700
They're totally
bizarre, all of that.

01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:07.650
But they live in these
big, cooperative colonies

01:12:07.650 --> 01:12:10.120
that are predominately
underground in Africa.

01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:13.440
And they were discovered, I
think, only in the 1970s or so.

01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:16.030
And for a while when
zoologists got together,

01:12:16.030 --> 01:12:18.220
if you were a naked
mole rat person,

01:12:18.220 --> 01:12:19.970
you were just the
coolest around.

01:12:19.970 --> 01:12:22.050
And everybody else
would feel intimidated,

01:12:22.050 --> 01:12:24.620
because you were working on
the best species out there.

01:12:24.620 --> 01:12:27.270
And you would see these
big cooperative colonies,

01:12:27.270 --> 01:12:30.490
soon shown to not
necessarily be of relatives.

01:12:30.490 --> 01:12:33.620
And reciprocity and all
those sorts of rules.

01:12:33.620 --> 01:12:35.830
But people soon
began to recognize

01:12:35.830 --> 01:12:39.350
there would be one or two
animals in each colony that

01:12:39.350 --> 01:12:41.070
weren't doing any work.

01:12:41.070 --> 01:12:44.800
Work digging out
tunnels, bookkeeping,

01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:47.070
I don't know what naked mole
rats do in terms of work.

01:12:47.070 --> 01:12:49.080
But there would be a
few individuals who

01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:50.550
would just be sitting around.

01:12:50.550 --> 01:12:53.200
And they were these big
old naked mole rats.

01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:54.950
They were much bigger
than the other ones,

01:12:54.950 --> 01:12:57.280
and they were scarfing
up food left and right.

01:12:57.280 --> 01:13:00.180
There goes Robert
Axelrod down the drain.

01:13:00.180 --> 01:13:01.640
There goes all
that optimization,

01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:03.860
because no one would be
punishing these guys.

01:13:03.860 --> 01:13:05.330
What's the deal?

01:13:05.330 --> 01:13:08.500
And it took enough watching
these animals long enough

01:13:08.500 --> 01:13:11.170
to see this notion
of oh, there's

01:13:11.170 --> 01:13:13.400
another game going
on in which they

01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:15.480
play a more important role.

01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:18.150
And it is sort of
dribbling across.

01:13:18.150 --> 01:13:22.230
When the rainy season comes,
these big naked mole rats

01:13:22.230 --> 01:13:25.780
go up and turn around and they
plug the entry to the tunnels

01:13:25.780 --> 01:13:26.280
then.

01:13:26.280 --> 01:13:27.600
[LAUGHTER]

01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:29.040
That's what they do.

01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:30.540
And suddenly,
these guys who have

01:13:30.540 --> 01:13:33.150
been sitting around doing
no work whatsoever all year

01:13:33.150 --> 01:13:36.610
and eating tons of stuff, they
suddenly have to now stick

01:13:36.610 --> 01:13:39.170
their rear ends out for
the coyotes to be around

01:13:39.170 --> 01:13:40.850
or whatever it is
that predates them.

01:13:40.850 --> 01:13:44.120
What we have is role
diversification.

01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:47.220
Real animals, real
organisms, are not just

01:13:47.220 --> 01:13:51.030
playing one formal prisoner's
dilemma game against each other

01:13:51.030 --> 01:13:52.870
at the same time.

01:13:52.870 --> 01:13:55.560
And by the time we, again,
get to the later lectures

01:13:55.560 --> 01:13:57.300
on aggression,
cooperation, all of that,

01:13:57.300 --> 01:14:00.820
we will not only see that things
get much more complicated when

01:14:00.820 --> 01:14:02.770
you're playing
simultaneous games,

01:14:02.770 --> 01:14:04.932
when you're playing a game
against one individual

01:14:04.932 --> 01:14:06.640
while you're playing
against another one,

01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:09.240
and then against
triangular circumstances.

01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:12.690
How play differs if you
know how many rounds

01:14:12.690 --> 01:14:14.910
you are playing against
the individual versus

01:14:14.910 --> 01:14:16.330
if you have no idea.

01:14:16.330 --> 01:14:18.560
How play differs
if, when you are

01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:20.530
about to play
against someone, you

01:14:20.530 --> 01:14:22.830
get to find out what
their behavior has

01:14:22.830 --> 01:14:25.660
been in the previous trials
with other individuals.

01:14:25.660 --> 01:14:29.200
In other words, if somebody
shows up with a reputation,

01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:31.940
we'll see this is a much
more complicated world

01:14:31.940 --> 01:14:33.370
of playing out these games.

01:14:33.370 --> 01:14:35.570
A much more realistic one.

01:14:35.570 --> 01:14:39.180
So we begin to see a first pass
at all this optimization stuff,

01:14:39.180 --> 01:14:40.710
and how great that all is.

01:14:40.710 --> 01:14:44.770
One final interesting addition
to this game theory world

01:14:44.770 --> 01:14:47.780
of thinking about behavior like
that, which came from a guy

01:14:47.780 --> 01:14:51.100
named James Holland,
who apparently-- might

01:14:51.100 --> 01:14:52.350
have a different first name.

01:14:52.350 --> 01:14:55.570
But Holland, apparently, as an
interesting piece in history,

01:14:55.570 --> 01:14:57.410
he's the person first
person to ever get

01:14:57.410 --> 01:14:59.670
a PhD in Computer Sciences.

01:14:59.670 --> 01:15:02.520
Which I think was in the late
50s, University of Michigan.

01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:05.980
Apparently, there are realms
of computer programmers

01:15:05.980 --> 01:15:07.400
who worship this guy.

01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:09.900
And he, like a lot of other
folks in that business,

01:15:09.900 --> 01:15:12.910
got interested in this
game theory evolution

01:15:12.910 --> 01:15:14.300
of optimal strategies.

01:15:14.300 --> 01:15:16.870
And he designed ways
of running all of this.

01:15:16.870 --> 01:15:18.910
And he introduced
a new ripple, which

01:15:18.910 --> 01:15:22.930
is the possibility of a
strategy suddenly changing.

01:15:22.930 --> 01:15:26.080
The possibility of a mutation.

01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:28.560
What he could then
study was mutations,

01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:31.290
how often they were
adaptive, how often they

01:15:31.290 --> 01:15:35.360
spread throughout the strategy
there, of individuals playing.

01:15:35.360 --> 01:15:38.120
How often they drove
the other strategies

01:15:38.120 --> 01:15:41.220
into extinction versus
ones that were quickly

01:15:41.220 --> 01:15:42.830
driven to extinction themselves.

01:15:42.830 --> 01:15:45.730
More cases where we are
getting these systems

01:15:45.730 --> 01:15:48.400
where maybe they're not just
metaphorically using terms

01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:49.580
from biology.

01:15:49.580 --> 01:15:52.670
Maybe they are exactly
modeling the same thing.

01:15:52.670 --> 01:15:55.690
And we will see more and
more evidence for that.

01:15:55.690 --> 01:15:58.170
OK, so reciprocal altruism.

01:15:58.170 --> 01:16:01.670
How would that play out in the
world of natural selection.

01:16:01.670 --> 01:16:04.520
Natural selection,
cooperative hunting.

01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:07.170
And there's lots of species
that have cooperative hunting.

01:16:07.170 --> 01:16:11.234
Wild dogs, jackals, some
other species as well.

01:16:11.234 --> 01:16:12.850
Clearly, that's
like the definition

01:16:12.850 --> 01:16:16.050
of cooperative hunting,
of reciprocal altruism,

01:16:16.050 --> 01:16:17.310
if they're not relatives.

01:16:17.310 --> 01:16:19.660
How would sexual
selection play out

01:16:19.660 --> 01:16:21.580
in the realm of
reciprocal altruism?

01:16:21.580 --> 01:16:23.210
A little bit less obvious there.

01:16:23.210 --> 01:16:25.660
That would be if you
and some non-relative

01:16:25.660 --> 01:16:28.330
spent an insane amount
of energy and time

01:16:28.330 --> 01:16:32.980
making sure you both look really
good before going to the prom.

01:16:32.980 --> 01:16:35.736
That would be sexual selection
working on reciprocal altruism

01:16:35.736 --> 01:16:36.650
system.

01:16:36.650 --> 01:16:40.160
So what we have now are
three building blocks.

01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:43.950
This whole trashing of it's
not survival of the fittest.

01:16:43.950 --> 01:16:46.537
It's not behaving for
the good of the species.

01:16:46.537 --> 01:16:48.370
It's not behaving for
the good of the group.

01:16:48.370 --> 01:16:49.980
But instead, these
three building

01:16:49.980 --> 01:16:54.430
blocks, the ways to optimize
as many copies of your genes

01:16:54.430 --> 01:16:56.290
in the next generation
as possible.

01:16:56.290 --> 01:16:59.620
Way number one,
individual selection,

01:16:59.620 --> 01:17:01.250
a version of selfish genes.

01:17:01.250 --> 01:17:04.500
Sometimes a chicken is an egg's
way of making another egg.

01:17:04.500 --> 01:17:07.260
Behavior is just a way of
getting copies of genes

01:17:07.260 --> 01:17:09.170
into the next generation.

01:17:09.170 --> 01:17:12.587
Piece number two, inclusive
fitness kin selection.

01:17:12.587 --> 01:17:14.420
That whole business,
that sometimes the best

01:17:14.420 --> 01:17:17.160
way of passing on copies
is to help relatives do it.

01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:19.270
And it's a function of
how related they are.

01:17:19.270 --> 01:17:23.850
The whole world of cooperation
more among related organisms

01:17:23.850 --> 01:17:25.330
than unrelated ones.

01:17:25.330 --> 01:17:28.150
And as we will see way
down the line, what

01:17:28.150 --> 01:17:30.480
is very challenging
in different species

01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:33.470
is, how do you figure out
who you are related to?

01:17:33.470 --> 01:17:36.970
And humans do it in a very
unique way that sets them up

01:17:36.970 --> 01:17:40.560
for being exploited in all
sorts of circumstances that

01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:44.470
begin to explain why culture
after culture, people

01:17:44.470 --> 01:17:48.920
are really not nice to thems,
and it flows along those lines.

01:17:48.920 --> 01:17:51.500
This is something we will
get to in a lot of detail.

01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:54.140
So degree of relatedness,
a lecture coming.

01:17:54.140 --> 01:17:56.020
How do you tell who
you're related to.

01:17:56.020 --> 01:17:58.440
But that second
piece, kin selection.

01:17:58.440 --> 01:18:00.800
Third piece,
reciprocal altruism.

01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:03.700
You scratch my back and
I'll scratch your back.

01:18:03.700 --> 01:18:06.775
And whenever possible, you want
to instead scratch your back,

01:18:06.775 --> 01:18:08.150
and they want to
make sure you're

01:18:08.150 --> 01:18:09.310
not scratching your back.

01:18:09.310 --> 01:18:11.020
Or whatever cheating counts as.

01:18:11.020 --> 01:18:13.730
But trying to cheat,
being vigilant against it,

01:18:13.730 --> 01:18:17.750
formal games where you can
optimize it, very complicated.

01:18:17.750 --> 01:18:20.360
And can you believe it, you
go out into the real world,

01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:23.140
and you find examples
of precisely that.

01:18:23.140 --> 01:18:25.830
Optimization with tit for
tat, isn't nature wonderful.

01:18:25.830 --> 01:18:27.470
It's gotta work that way.

01:18:27.470 --> 01:18:30.800
Then you begin to see how the
real world is more complicated.

01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:34.290
Multiple roles, naked mole
rats stuck in plumbing,

01:18:34.290 --> 01:18:36.940
things of that sort.

01:18:36.940 --> 01:18:38.350
These are the principles.

01:18:38.350 --> 01:18:40.930
And what people of this
school of evolutionary thought

01:18:40.930 --> 01:18:44.010
would say, armed with
these sorts of principles,

01:18:44.010 --> 01:18:47.200
you could now look at all
sorts of interesting domains

01:18:47.200 --> 01:18:49.980
of animal behavior
and understand

01:18:49.980 --> 01:18:53.200
what the behavior is going
to be like by using these.

01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:55.290
OK, we start with
the first example.

01:18:55.290 --> 01:18:57.910
Here we return to these guys.

01:18:57.910 --> 01:19:01.280
And we have one species
here, and knowing

01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:03.550
this guy had a penis
and this one nursed,

01:19:03.550 --> 01:19:05.790
we've got an adult male
and an adult female.

01:19:05.790 --> 01:19:07.560
What is it that
you can conclude?

01:19:07.560 --> 01:19:12.680
In this species, males are
a lot bigger than females.

01:19:12.680 --> 01:19:16.740
Let's state it here as there's
a big ratio of males to females.

01:19:16.740 --> 01:19:18.450
Meanwhile in the
next county, you've

01:19:18.450 --> 01:19:21.070
discovered another species
where somebody's got a penis

01:19:21.070 --> 01:19:22.380
and somebody else is nursing.

01:19:22.380 --> 01:19:24.440
And their skulls are
the exact same size.

01:19:24.440 --> 01:19:26.310
Oh, here's a species
where there's

01:19:26.310 --> 01:19:31.130
no difference in body size
between males and females.

01:19:31.130 --> 01:19:33.520
Let's begin to see, just
using the principles

01:19:33.520 --> 01:19:38.140
we've got in hand already, what
sort of stuff we can predict.

01:19:38.140 --> 01:19:41.960
Starting, which of those
species-- in one case,

01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:45.660
you have males being a
lot bigger than females.

01:19:45.660 --> 01:19:49.020
In one case, you've got males
being the same size as females.

01:19:49.020 --> 01:19:51.840
In which of those species,
the first one like this,

01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:53.700
or the same size
ones, which ones

01:19:53.700 --> 01:19:56.360
would you expect to see
more male aggression?

01:19:56.360 --> 01:19:58.280
First one.

01:19:58.280 --> 01:19:58.900
First one.

01:19:58.900 --> 01:20:00.778
OK, how come?

01:20:00.778 --> 01:20:02.230
Their bodies are built for it.

01:20:02.230 --> 01:20:03.760
Their bodies are built for it.

01:20:03.760 --> 01:20:05.410
Which begins to
tell you something,

01:20:05.410 --> 01:20:07.080
their bodies are
built for it, maybe

01:20:07.080 --> 01:20:09.240
because females have
been selecting for that.

01:20:09.240 --> 01:20:12.300
You will see higher
levels of aggression

01:20:12.300 --> 01:20:16.140
in species like this, where
there's a big body size

01:20:16.140 --> 01:20:19.840
difference, and much
less of it in these guys.

01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:23.960
Next, you now ask how
much variability is there

01:20:23.960 --> 01:20:26.320
in male reproductive success.

01:20:26.320 --> 01:20:29.470
In one of these
species, all the males

01:20:29.470 --> 01:20:32.180
have one or two kids
over their lifetime.

01:20:32.180 --> 01:20:35.890
In another species,
95% of the reproducing

01:20:35.890 --> 01:20:38.320
is carried out by
5% of the males.

01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:42.820
A huge variability skew in
male reproductive success.

01:20:42.820 --> 01:20:45.980
Which species do you
get the every male has

01:20:45.980 --> 01:20:49.030
a couple of kids, and that's
about it, and all equally so?

01:20:49.030 --> 01:20:50.010
Which one?

01:20:50.010 --> 01:20:50.720
[INAUDIBLE]

01:20:50.720 --> 01:20:51.530
Second one.

01:20:51.530 --> 01:20:52.200
How come?

01:20:56.750 --> 01:21:00.600
Because these guys are being
selected for aggression.

01:21:00.600 --> 01:21:02.115
If they're fighting,
there's going

01:21:02.115 --> 01:21:03.990
to have to be something
they're fighting for.

01:21:03.990 --> 01:21:06.530
Deferential reproductive access.

01:21:06.530 --> 01:21:13.600
OK, so you see more variability
in species that look like this.

01:21:13.600 --> 01:21:16.090
Next, females come
into the equation.

01:21:16.090 --> 01:21:17.890
What do females want?

01:21:17.890 --> 01:21:20.460
What do females want in
the species on the left

01:21:20.460 --> 01:21:21.840
versus the one on the right?

01:21:21.840 --> 01:21:24.720
The one on the
right, again, skull's

01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:26.260
the same size, same body size.

01:21:26.260 --> 01:21:29.720
On the left, what
does the female want?

01:21:29.720 --> 01:21:32.595
[INAUDIBLE]

01:21:32.595 --> 01:21:35.153
What sort of male is the
female interested in?

01:21:35.153 --> 01:21:36.000
[INAUDIBLE]

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:36.570
Big.

01:21:36.570 --> 01:21:37.520
Exactly.

01:21:37.520 --> 01:21:40.290
That's exactly the
driving force on this.

01:21:40.290 --> 01:21:41.430
How come?

01:21:41.430 --> 01:21:44.615
Because she's not going to get
anything else out of this guy.

01:21:44.615 --> 01:21:46.490
This guy is just going
to, like-- the present

01:21:46.490 --> 01:21:47.573
is going to be some sperm.

01:21:47.573 --> 01:21:50.590
It might as well be some
good sperm, some genetically

01:21:50.590 --> 01:21:53.910
well-endowed sperm that makes
her a big healthy offspring,

01:21:53.910 --> 01:21:57.000
increasing the odds of her
passing on copies of her genes

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:58.550
in the next generation.

01:21:58.550 --> 01:22:01.340
What about in this species?

01:22:01.340 --> 01:22:02.820
What's females looking for?

01:22:05.808 --> 01:22:06.810
[INAUDIBLE]

01:22:06.810 --> 01:22:08.780
OK, good.

01:22:08.780 --> 01:22:10.970
Hold on to that for
a second, and let's

01:22:10.970 --> 01:22:13.470
jump ahead a few lines.

01:22:13.470 --> 01:22:16.810
One of the species,
males have never

01:22:16.810 --> 01:22:20.160
been known to do the slightest
affiliative thing with infants.

01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:22.930
They just get irritated and
harass them and all of that.

01:22:22.930 --> 01:22:25.960
In the other, you
have soccer dads

01:22:25.960 --> 01:22:30.270
who are doing as much raising
of the kids as the females are.

01:22:30.270 --> 01:22:33.990
In which species do you get
lots of male parental behavior?

01:22:33.990 --> 01:22:35.190
Smaller.

01:22:35.190 --> 01:22:36.250
The one on the right.

01:22:36.250 --> 01:22:36.800
OK.

01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:39.227
So lots of male
parental behavior here.

01:22:43.050 --> 01:22:45.850
Somebody just gave the
answer here, female choice.

01:22:45.850 --> 01:22:47.580
What would you see
in this species?

01:22:47.580 --> 01:22:49.680
You want big, muscular guys.

01:22:49.680 --> 01:22:52.520
You want whatever is
selling that season for what

01:22:52.520 --> 01:22:55.890
counts as a hot male, because
you want your offspring

01:22:55.890 --> 01:22:57.440
to have those traits.

01:22:57.440 --> 01:22:59.100
And somebody else
called out here,

01:22:59.100 --> 01:23:01.630
what do females want
in this category?

01:23:01.630 --> 01:23:03.964
And what was it you said?

01:23:03.964 --> 01:23:04.672
Good personality.

01:23:04.672 --> 01:23:05.171
[LAUGHTER]

01:23:05.171 --> 01:23:06.600
Good personality.

01:23:06.600 --> 01:23:08.020
Yes.

01:23:08.020 --> 01:23:09.950
Able to express emotions.

01:23:09.950 --> 01:23:11.276
[LAUGHTER]

01:23:11.276 --> 01:23:13.016
That, too.

01:23:13.016 --> 01:23:14.640
OK, somebody else
shouted out something

01:23:14.640 --> 01:23:18.780
that gets at the broader,
more globally Oprah version.

01:23:18.780 --> 01:23:20.166
OK, somebody shouted out--

01:23:20.166 --> 01:23:21.560
[INAUDIBLE]

01:23:21.560 --> 01:23:23.610
--parental behavior.

01:23:23.610 --> 01:23:26.830
You want a male who is going
to be competent at raising

01:23:26.830 --> 01:23:27.740
your children.

01:23:27.740 --> 01:23:31.110
What is it that you
want, really most deeply?

01:23:31.110 --> 01:23:34.350
You want to get the male who
is the most like a female you

01:23:34.350 --> 01:23:35.730
can get a hold of.

01:23:35.730 --> 01:23:38.050
You don't want some
big old stupid guy

01:23:38.050 --> 01:23:41.390
with a lot of muscle and canines
who's wasting energy on stuff

01:23:41.390 --> 01:23:45.280
like that he could be using
instead on reading Goodnight

01:23:45.280 --> 01:23:47.000
Moon or some such thing.

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:50.260
What you want
instead is somebody

01:23:50.260 --> 01:23:53.140
who's as close to a female as
you can get to without getting

01:23:53.140 --> 01:23:54.670
this lactation stuff.

01:23:54.670 --> 01:23:59.770
Males are chosen who are
the same size as females.

01:23:59.770 --> 01:24:04.670
So the term given here is
choosing for paternal behavior,

01:24:04.670 --> 01:24:06.130
parental behavior.

01:24:06.130 --> 01:24:08.250
Parental, let's just
put that in there.

01:24:08.250 --> 01:24:11.130
And that begins to explain
the top line, species

01:24:11.130 --> 01:24:14.480
in which there's a lot
of sexual dimorphism.

01:24:14.480 --> 01:24:16.300
Morphism, shapes of things.

01:24:16.300 --> 01:24:18.470
Sexual dimorphism,
big difference

01:24:18.470 --> 01:24:21.540
in body size as a
function of gender.

01:24:21.540 --> 01:24:23.680
And in these sorts
of species where

01:24:23.680 --> 01:24:25.780
you get male parental
behavior, not

01:24:25.780 --> 01:24:27.844
much variability in male
reproductive success,

01:24:27.844 --> 01:24:29.260
low levels of
aggression, and what

01:24:29.260 --> 01:24:31.450
females want is
a competent male.

01:24:31.450 --> 01:24:35.650
These are ones where you see low
degrees of sexual dimorphism.

01:24:35.650 --> 01:24:37.490
So how's a female
going to figure out

01:24:37.490 --> 01:24:40.090
that this guy is going
to be a competent parent?

01:24:40.090 --> 01:24:43.240
Once again, we just figured out,
if he looks kind of like you.

01:24:43.240 --> 01:24:46.520
Because that suggests he hasn't
wasted health and metabolism

01:24:46.520 --> 01:24:48.470
on stupid, pointless
muscles when there's

01:24:48.470 --> 01:24:50.380
more important things
in life for making sure

01:24:50.380 --> 01:24:51.820
your kids have good values.

01:24:51.820 --> 01:24:54.270
What else would the female
want to know when she's first

01:24:54.270 --> 01:24:55.895
considering mating with a male?

01:24:58.630 --> 01:25:00.162
Is he a nice guy,
is he sensitive,

01:25:00.162 --> 01:25:01.370
does he express his feelings.

01:25:01.370 --> 01:25:04.630
Is he competent
at being a parent.

01:25:04.630 --> 01:25:06.760
What do you want the
individual to do?

01:25:06.760 --> 01:25:10.620
Prove to you that he can
provide for the kids.

01:25:10.620 --> 01:25:15.370
And suddenly you have a world of
male birds courting the females

01:25:15.370 --> 01:25:17.310
by bringing them worms.

01:25:17.310 --> 01:25:19.220
Bringing them
evidence that they are

01:25:19.220 --> 01:25:22.620
able to successfully forage,
they are able to get food.

01:25:22.620 --> 01:25:25.500
Female choice is built
around appearance

01:25:25.500 --> 01:25:27.990
and behavioral
competence at being

01:25:27.990 --> 01:25:30.150
able to be a successful
parent in order

01:25:30.150 --> 01:25:31.570
to pass on as many
copies of genes

01:25:31.570 --> 01:25:33.150
to the next generation
as possible.

01:25:33.150 --> 01:25:35.540
OK, how about life span.

01:25:35.540 --> 01:25:39.160
In which species is there a big
difference in life expectancy

01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:41.184
as a function of gender?

01:25:41.184 --> 01:25:42.540
First one.

01:25:42.540 --> 01:25:43.400
First one.

01:25:43.400 --> 01:25:45.070
Here you're choosing
for males to be

01:25:45.070 --> 01:25:47.880
as close to females as possible,
and thus the physiology.

01:25:47.880 --> 01:25:50.390
Here you've got
these guys who are

01:25:50.390 --> 01:25:52.910
using huge amounts
of energy to build up

01:25:52.910 --> 01:25:55.560
all this muscle, which
takes a lot more work

01:25:55.560 --> 01:25:57.200
to keep in calories.

01:25:57.200 --> 01:25:59.190
And you're more
vulnerable in famines.

01:25:59.190 --> 01:26:01.910
You've got these males
with high testosterone,

01:26:01.910 --> 01:26:05.080
which does bad stuff to
your circulatory system.

01:26:05.080 --> 01:26:07.890
You've got males who, thanks
to all this aggression,

01:26:07.890 --> 01:26:10.250
are getting more
injuries, more likely.

01:26:10.250 --> 01:26:13.690
In species in which you have
a lot of sexual dimorphism

01:26:13.690 --> 01:26:19.050
in body size, you get a lot of
sexual dimorphism in life span.

01:26:19.050 --> 01:26:21.790
Then you look at these
guys, and it's basically

01:26:21.790 --> 01:26:23.540
no difference by gender.

01:26:23.540 --> 01:26:25.110
Moving on.

01:26:25.110 --> 01:26:27.030
Considering primates
that are one

01:26:27.030 --> 01:26:30.280
of these two patterns, in
which one do you always

01:26:30.280 --> 01:26:32.930
want to give birth to twins,
in which one do you never

01:26:32.930 --> 01:26:34.130
want to give birth to twins?

01:26:34.130 --> 01:26:35.983
Who gives birth to twins?

01:26:35.983 --> 01:26:36.690
[INAUDIBLE]

01:26:36.690 --> 01:26:38.160
The one of the right, of course.

01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:38.890
How come?

01:26:38.890 --> 01:26:41.010
Because you've got two
parents on the scene.

01:26:41.010 --> 01:26:42.560
You are not a single mother.

01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:45.300
And you are a single mother
rhesus monkey or something,

01:26:45.300 --> 01:26:47.820
and you give birth to
twins, and you do not

01:26:47.820 --> 01:26:50.230
have the remotest
chance of enough energy,

01:26:50.230 --> 01:26:53.710
enough calories on board, to
get both of them to survive.

01:26:53.710 --> 01:26:57.770
A twin that is born
in a species like this

01:26:57.770 --> 01:27:01.000
has the same rate that it occurs
in humans, about a 1% rate.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:04.390
And it is almost inevitable that
one of them does not survive.

01:27:04.390 --> 01:27:07.520
Meanwhile, there's a whole
world of primate species

01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:10.520
with this profile where
the females always twin.

01:27:13.460 --> 01:27:16.210
Finally, you are
the female and you

01:27:16.210 --> 01:27:19.590
are contemplating
bailing out on your kids

01:27:19.590 --> 01:27:21.020
and disappearing,
because there's

01:27:21.020 --> 01:27:24.540
some really hot guy over there
who you want to mate with.

01:27:24.540 --> 01:27:27.420
And you are trying to
figure out this strategy.

01:27:27.420 --> 01:27:30.760
So you are going to leave
and abandon your kids.

01:27:30.760 --> 01:27:34.080
In which species do
you see that behavior?

01:27:34.080 --> 01:27:35.070
The one on the right.

01:27:35.070 --> 01:27:37.980
The one on the right, because
you bail out and the male

01:27:37.980 --> 01:27:39.200
is there taking care of them.

01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:42.670
You bail out in here, and you've
lost your investment and copies

01:27:42.670 --> 01:27:44.350
your genes for the
next generation.

01:27:44.350 --> 01:27:48.050
You see female cuckoldry,
this great Victorian term.

01:27:48.050 --> 01:27:51.770
You see females cheating on
the fathers in this species,

01:27:51.770 --> 01:27:53.580
but not in species like this.

01:27:53.580 --> 01:27:58.060
Because the father is long gone
and three other counties there,

01:27:58.060 --> 01:27:59.430
courting somebody else.

01:27:59.430 --> 01:28:00.920
And it doesn't
matter, you're not

01:28:00.920 --> 01:28:02.370
going to get any help from him.

01:28:02.370 --> 01:28:04.650
In primate species
of this profile,

01:28:04.650 --> 01:28:06.650
you always see twinning.

01:28:06.650 --> 01:28:08.440
And they both survive.

01:28:08.440 --> 01:28:10.660
And what studies have
shown in these species,

01:28:10.660 --> 01:28:12.420
and we'll get to
them shortly, is

01:28:12.420 --> 01:28:16.434
after birth, in fact, the males
are expending more calories

01:28:16.434 --> 01:28:17.850
taking care of the
offspring, then

01:28:17.850 --> 01:28:22.570
the females go bail out on him
and go find some other hot guy.

01:28:22.570 --> 01:28:24.320
Which, in your species,
counts as some guy

01:28:24.320 --> 01:28:27.400
who looks even more like you
than he does in terms of what

01:28:27.400 --> 01:28:29.190
you want out of the individual.

01:28:29.190 --> 01:28:29.967
So that.

01:28:29.967 --> 01:28:31.050
So what have we done here?

01:28:31.050 --> 01:28:33.700
We've just gone through
applying these principles

01:28:33.700 --> 01:28:35.590
in this logical
way, and everybody

01:28:35.590 --> 01:28:38.550
from the very first step was
getting the right outcome.

01:28:38.550 --> 01:28:41.800
And go, and these are
exactly the profiles

01:28:41.800 --> 01:28:43.600
you find in certain species.

01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:46.420
Among social mammals,
these would be referred to

01:28:46.420 --> 01:28:48.770
as a tournament species.

01:28:48.770 --> 01:28:51.470
A tournament species,
whereas the one on the right

01:28:51.470 --> 01:28:55.730
is referred to as a pair
bonding, a monogamous species.

01:28:55.730 --> 01:28:58.420
Because in this one,
males and females

01:28:58.420 --> 01:29:01.840
stay together, because they
both have equivalent investment

01:29:01.840 --> 01:29:03.120
in taking care of the kids.

01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:04.000
All of that.

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:05.830
What you have here
is this contrast

01:29:05.830 --> 01:29:10.010
between tournament species
and pair bonding species.

01:29:10.010 --> 01:29:13.020
Tournament species,
these are all the species

01:29:13.020 --> 01:29:16.690
where you get males with
big, bright plumage.

01:29:16.690 --> 01:29:19.660
These are peacocks,
these are all those birds

01:29:19.660 --> 01:29:22.640
and fish species where the
males are all brightly colored.

01:29:22.640 --> 01:29:25.000
What are the females
choosing for?

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:28.580
Peacock feathers does not make
for a good peacock mother.

01:29:28.580 --> 01:29:31.860
Peacock feathers are signs
of being healthy enough

01:29:31.860 --> 01:29:33.640
that you can waste
lots of energy

01:29:33.640 --> 01:29:35.740
on these big stupid
pointless feathers.

01:29:35.740 --> 01:29:37.470
That's a sign of health.

01:29:37.470 --> 01:29:41.030
That's a sign of all I'm getting
from this peacock is genes,

01:29:41.030 --> 01:29:42.750
I might as well
go for good ones.

01:29:42.750 --> 01:29:44.250
That's the world
of peacocks, that's

01:29:44.250 --> 01:29:46.930
the world of chickens
with pecking orders,

01:29:46.930 --> 01:29:49.210
dominating like that,
lots of aggression.

01:29:49.210 --> 01:29:53.210
That's the world of primates
where, as in savanna baboons,

01:29:53.210 --> 01:29:55.560
the male is twice as
big as the female.

01:29:55.560 --> 01:30:00.010
Tournament species, where a
lot of passing on of genes

01:30:00.010 --> 01:30:03.570
is decided by male-male
aggression in the context

01:30:03.570 --> 01:30:07.950
of tournaments producing
massive amounts of variability

01:30:07.950 --> 01:30:09.440
in reproductive success.

01:30:09.440 --> 01:30:12.300
Where males are being selected
for being good at this,

01:30:12.300 --> 01:30:15.260
so they sure are being selected
for having big bodies, which

01:30:15.260 --> 01:30:16.814
winds up meaning
a shortened life

01:30:16.814 --> 01:30:17.980
span for a bunch of reasons.

01:30:17.980 --> 01:30:19.600
Females are choosing for that.

01:30:19.600 --> 01:30:21.620
These are guys who are
not using their energy

01:30:21.620 --> 01:30:23.840
on parental behavior,
thus you do not

01:30:23.840 --> 01:30:26.160
want to have twins if
you are a female baboon,

01:30:26.160 --> 01:30:28.030
and you do not want to
bail out on the kids

01:30:28.030 --> 01:30:30.170
because nobody else is
going to take care of them.

01:30:30.170 --> 01:30:33.020
Go and look at a
new primate species,

01:30:33.020 --> 01:30:36.100
and see this much of a
difference in skull size,

01:30:36.100 --> 01:30:38.260
and you'd just be able
to derive everything

01:30:38.260 --> 01:30:40.420
else about its social behavior.

01:30:40.420 --> 01:30:44.140
Meanwhile, these guys on the
right, pair bonding species.

01:30:44.140 --> 01:30:47.300
These are found among South
American monkeys, marmosets,

01:30:47.300 --> 01:30:48.180
tamarins.

01:30:48.180 --> 01:30:50.010
You put up a picture
of them, which

01:30:50.010 --> 01:30:51.866
I will do if I ever
master PowerPoint

01:30:51.866 --> 01:30:53.490
in some subsequent
lecture-- you put up

01:30:53.490 --> 01:30:56.590
a picture of a marmoset
pair, and you can't tell

01:30:56.590 --> 01:30:58.340
who's the male and the female.

01:30:58.340 --> 01:31:00.570
This is not the world
of the mandrill baboons,

01:31:00.570 --> 01:31:04.310
with males with big, bright,
bizarre coloration on the face,

01:31:04.310 --> 01:31:06.700
and with antlers when
the females don't,

01:31:06.700 --> 01:31:09.681
and that whole world
of sexual dimorphism.

01:31:09.681 --> 01:31:11.180
You can't tell which
one is the male

01:31:11.180 --> 01:31:13.920
and which one is the female
marmoset by looking at them.

01:31:13.920 --> 01:31:16.180
You can't tell by seeing
how long they live.

01:31:16.180 --> 01:31:17.630
You can't tell by
how much they're

01:31:17.630 --> 01:31:19.180
taking care of the kids.

01:31:19.180 --> 01:31:22.180
You can't tell in terms of
their reproductive variability.

01:31:22.180 --> 01:31:24.560
That's a whole different
world of selection.

01:31:24.560 --> 01:31:27.950
All of the South American
tamarins and marmosets,

01:31:27.950 --> 01:31:30.010
the females always twin.

01:31:30.010 --> 01:31:31.710
They have a higher
rate of cuckoldry,

01:31:31.710 --> 01:31:33.400
of abandoning the kids.

01:31:33.400 --> 01:31:35.520
The males take as much
care, if not more,

01:31:35.520 --> 01:31:37.100
of the kids than
the female does.

01:31:37.100 --> 01:31:38.470
Very low levels of aggression.

01:31:38.470 --> 01:31:40.320
Same body size, same lifespan.

01:31:40.320 --> 01:31:43.020
All the males have low
degree of variability.

01:31:43.020 --> 01:31:43.880
How come?

01:31:43.880 --> 01:31:45.910
Because if you're
some marmoset male,

01:31:45.910 --> 01:31:49.150
you don't want to get 47
marmoset females pregnant.

01:31:49.150 --> 01:31:51.970
Because you are going to have
to take care of all the kids.

01:31:51.970 --> 01:31:55.010
Because as we will see way
down the line in lectures

01:31:55.010 --> 01:31:57.900
on parental behavior,
the wiring there is such

01:31:57.900 --> 01:32:01.310
is bonding with the offspring
and taking care of them.

01:32:01.310 --> 01:32:03.870
No wonder among
species like these,

01:32:03.870 --> 01:32:05.810
you have very low variability.

01:32:05.810 --> 01:32:08.100
All the males reproduce
once or twice.

01:32:08.100 --> 01:32:10.780
This is the world of 5%
of the guys accounting

01:32:10.780 --> 01:32:12.890
for 95% of the matings.

01:32:12.890 --> 01:32:16.160
This is totally
remarkable because again,

01:32:16.160 --> 01:32:17.320
that starting point.

01:32:17.320 --> 01:32:19.320
You start off here,
and you look at these,

01:32:19.320 --> 01:32:21.530
and oh, you can tell if
they were bipedal and were

01:32:21.530 --> 01:32:24.650
they diseased or malnourished,
simply by applying

01:32:24.650 --> 01:32:28.200
these principles of individual
selection, reciprocity,

01:32:28.200 --> 01:32:29.050
all of that.

01:32:29.050 --> 01:32:32.230
One factoid, you see
a new primate species,

01:32:32.230 --> 01:32:34.760
and you see one nursing
and one with a penis,

01:32:34.760 --> 01:32:37.820
and they're the same size or
there's difference in the size,

01:32:37.820 --> 01:32:40.850
and you already know all
about their social system.

01:32:40.850 --> 01:32:46.620
Very consistent across birds,
across fish, across primates.

01:32:46.620 --> 01:32:48.730
Of course, all of
those, this dichotomy

01:32:48.730 --> 01:32:52.210
between tournament species
and pair bonding species.

01:32:52.210 --> 01:32:54.570
As we will see
way down the line,

01:32:54.570 --> 01:32:57.540
among some species,
types of voles, rodents,

01:32:57.540 --> 01:33:01.060
that are famous in Hallmark
cards for their pair bonding,

01:33:01.060 --> 01:33:02.310
for their monogamy.

01:33:02.310 --> 01:33:04.560
As we'll see, they're
not quite as monogamous

01:33:04.560 --> 01:33:05.390
as you would think.

01:33:05.390 --> 01:33:09.190
But nonetheless, a general
structure like this.

01:33:09.190 --> 01:33:14.860
So, one asks expectedly, where
do humans fit in on this one?

01:33:14.860 --> 01:33:16.530
Where do humans fit?

01:33:16.530 --> 01:33:19.320
And the answer
is, complicatedly.

01:33:19.320 --> 01:33:22.820
Are we a tournament species,
are we a pair bonding species.

01:33:22.820 --> 01:33:24.240
What's up with that?

01:33:24.240 --> 01:33:28.520
What we will see is
we're kind of in between.

01:33:28.520 --> 01:33:31.310
When you look at the degree
of sexual dimorphism,

01:33:31.310 --> 01:33:34.440
we are not like baboons, but
we're sure not like marmosets.

01:33:34.440 --> 01:33:36.080
We're somewhere in the middle.

01:33:36.080 --> 01:33:39.530
Variability is somewhere
in the middle there.

01:33:39.530 --> 01:33:41.250
I'm not going near that one.

01:33:41.250 --> 01:33:44.200
Life span, the
dimorphism in lifespan

01:33:44.200 --> 01:33:46.880
tends to be in between.

01:33:46.880 --> 01:33:49.290
Parental behavior and
likelihood-- all of those,

01:33:49.290 --> 01:33:50.800
you look at a
number of measures.

01:33:50.800 --> 01:33:53.370
And by next lecture,
we'll be looking

01:33:53.370 --> 01:33:56.570
at some genetics of what
a monogamous species

01:33:56.570 --> 01:33:58.560
and tournament
species look like.

01:33:58.560 --> 01:34:00.780
And we're right in the middle.

01:34:00.780 --> 01:34:04.980
In other words, that explains
like 90% of literature.

01:34:04.980 --> 01:34:08.010
Because we're not a classic
tournament species and we're

01:34:08.010 --> 01:34:09.760
not a classic pair bonding one.

01:34:09.760 --> 01:34:12.790
We are terribly confused
in the middle there.

01:34:12.790 --> 01:34:17.250
And everything about
anthropology supports that.

01:34:17.250 --> 01:34:19.980
Most people on the
planet right now

01:34:19.980 --> 01:34:23.220
are in a form of
monogamous relationships

01:34:23.220 --> 01:34:28.000
in a culture that
demands monogamy.

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.700
An awful lot of people who are
in monogamous relationships

01:34:30.700 --> 01:34:33.910
in such cultures aren't really
in monogamous relationships.

01:34:33.910 --> 01:34:38.850
Traditionally, most cultures on
this planet allowed polygamy.

01:34:38.850 --> 01:34:41.960
Nonetheless, in most of
those polygamous cultures,

01:34:41.960 --> 01:34:45.760
the majority of individuals
were pair bonded and monogamous.

01:34:45.760 --> 01:34:47.690
You get two different
versions of polygamy

01:34:47.690 --> 01:34:49.650
in different social
systems of humans.

01:34:49.650 --> 01:34:53.620
One is economic polygamy,
which is you're basically

01:34:53.620 --> 01:34:57.200
sitting around, and the
wealthiest guy in the village

01:34:57.200 --> 01:35:00.680
is the one who can have the
largest number of wives.

01:35:00.680 --> 01:35:02.910
An enormous skew in
reproductive success

01:35:02.910 --> 01:35:04.800
that's driven by economics.

01:35:04.800 --> 01:35:06.970
The other type is demographic.

01:35:06.970 --> 01:35:09.380
You have a culture
where, for example, you

01:35:09.380 --> 01:35:11.050
have a warrior class.

01:35:11.050 --> 01:35:14.570
Guys spend 10 years as
warriors-- worriers, warriors,

01:35:14.570 --> 01:35:15.920
New York City accent.

01:35:15.920 --> 01:35:17.870
As warriors, they don't worry.

01:35:17.870 --> 01:35:18.730
There's no anxiety.

01:35:18.730 --> 01:35:20.350
But they eventually worry
about getting a wife,

01:35:20.350 --> 01:35:22.450
because by the time they're
done being a warrior,

01:35:22.450 --> 01:35:24.060
they're like 25.

01:35:24.060 --> 01:35:26.330
And they marry someone
who's 13, which

01:35:26.330 --> 01:35:28.520
is what you see in a lot
of traditional cultures

01:35:28.520 --> 01:35:29.970
that follow that pattern.

01:35:29.970 --> 01:35:32.460
And at that point,
you've got a problem,

01:35:32.460 --> 01:35:35.260
which is an awful lot of
those guys have been killed

01:35:35.260 --> 01:35:38.220
over the course of 10
years of being involved

01:35:38.220 --> 01:35:41.030
in high levels of aggression
and 10 more years of life

01:35:41.030 --> 01:35:42.610
expectancy to catch up with you.

01:35:42.610 --> 01:35:44.640
There's is a shortage of males.

01:35:44.640 --> 01:35:48.000
So you see polygamy there
driven by demographics,

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.660
and you see polygamy
driven by economics

01:35:50.660 --> 01:35:52.270
in other types of society.

01:35:52.270 --> 01:35:56.070
So most cultures on this
planet allow-- traditionally,

01:35:56.070 --> 01:35:57.690
before the
missionaries got them--

01:35:57.690 --> 01:36:00.530
most cultures on this
planet allow polygamy.

01:36:00.530 --> 01:36:03.520
Nonetheless, within most
polygamous cultures,

01:36:03.520 --> 01:36:06.270
the majority of people
are not polygamous.

01:36:06.270 --> 01:36:10.580
We have one really confused,
screwed up species here.

01:36:10.580 --> 01:36:14.160
Because we are halfway in
between in all sorts of these

01:36:14.160 --> 01:36:15.190
measures.

01:36:15.190 --> 01:36:17.770
OK, so what do we
have next, which

01:36:17.770 --> 01:36:19.240
we will pick up on Friday.

01:36:19.240 --> 01:36:20.940
What we've just
started with here

01:36:20.940 --> 01:36:23.810
is the first case of using
all these principles,

01:36:23.810 --> 01:36:26.590
individual selection, kin
selection, reciprocal altruism,

01:36:26.590 --> 01:36:29.390
to understand all sorts
of aspects of behavior.

01:36:29.390 --> 01:36:31.770
We will then move
on to seeing how

01:36:31.770 --> 01:36:35.040
they explain other aspects
of animal behavior, some ones

01:36:35.040 --> 01:36:38.290
which, if you are behaving for
the good of the species circa

01:36:38.290 --> 01:36:42.070
1960, there's no explanation
at all, because you're

01:36:42.070 --> 01:36:45.520
doing things like killing
other members of your species.

01:36:45.520 --> 01:36:47.620
And then finally,
we will see how

01:36:47.620 --> 01:36:51.090
this applies to humans and
some of the witheringly

01:36:51.090 --> 01:36:52.930
appropriate--

01:36:52.930 --> 01:36:56.190

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.958
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:05.938
Stanford University.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.600
OK.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:11.380
Let's get going.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.280
Various announcements,
procedural things.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.620
A number of people want more
information about grading

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.580
and what the exams
are like, all of that.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.740
I think I mentioned
one-third of the points

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.800
will come from the midterm,
2/3 from the final.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.890
In terms of the
style of the midterm,

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.500
the midterm is
heavily going to be

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.550
about making sure you
got down all the factoids

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.130
from the first
half of the course,

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.460
that you've got the basics of
each of our proverbial buckets.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.520
The second half of
the final is all

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.730
going to be about
integration, thinking

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.550
across the different categories.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.030
So just a sense of that.

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:49.920
Readings.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.770
Readings, as they
are coming out,

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.340
the books are not required until
the second half of the course.

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.640
The handout on
Monday, I think, said

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.430
which chapters of
the [? Zebra ?] book

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.640
you should read.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.680
We will shortly get to you which
chapters of the [? Chaos ?]

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.490
book you should read as well.

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.270
The readings that
are being posted

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.920
on the CourseWorks, the
downloads of various published

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.130
papers, those are required.

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.940
I'm clear on those
whether this is

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.240
a paper you should read
all of, if this is one you

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.860
should read the abstract of.

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.350
Even if you read all
of, do not read it

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.200
in some obsessive,
detail-oriented way.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.650
The goal is probably to be
able to say, in one or two

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.040
paragraphs, why this paper
has something pertinent to say

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.200
about the topic they fell into.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.350
You're not sitting there
having to memorize techniques,

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.610
middle names of the authors,
how many animals, anything

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:41.952
like that.

00:01:41.952 --> 00:01:43.660
In terms of that, it
probably makes sense

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.240
to read those after the
first lecture of whatever

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.930
block there is.

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.010
And hopefully, if
I get organized,

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.970
I'll be able to get you sort
of a list of the readings

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.490
further in advance than
one week in advance.

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.660
Nonetheless, you should
probably hold off reading it

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.200
until after the lecture occurs.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.710
Let's see.

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:02.210
What else?

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.160
People wanted to get a
sense of how long things

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.320
were going to go.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.430
As we'll see today, the
evolution lecture topic

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:11.130
will cover two classes.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.340
Molecular genetics, which is
what we'll pick up on Monday,

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.040
I'm guessing one
to one and a half.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.890
Behavior genetics following
that, one to one and a half,

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.470
ethology one.

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.660
Neurobiology,
endocrinology, we'll

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.480
have one week devoted
to intro to the topics.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.280
And again, that's one where this
is so important for everybody

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.270
to be up to speed rather
than these being in catch-up

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.500
sections that week.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.270
The whole week, Monday,
Wednesday, Friday,

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.780
will be devoted to that
with the TAs teaching it.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.090
The following week, three more
lectures, more advanced ones.

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.970
And depending on
proximity to the midterm,

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.250
there may be a half-lecture
in there on statistics,

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.980
or maybe not.

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.560
So this is going to depend
on keeping on schedule.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.190
This is a rough approximation.

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.230
The midterm is going
to be a Monday night.

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.760
You will be responsible for
material up to the previous

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.880
Wednesday, and there will
be lots of review stuff.

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.930
Take a look at the extended
notes being posted.

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:05.610
What else?

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.970
OK.

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.410
I think that covers most
of the procedural stuff.

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.980
All of this stuff will
get posted as well.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.990
So picking up on the other day.

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.010
What was happening
the other day?

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.640
Number one, the trouncing of
Darwin inventing evolution,

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.640
trouncing of survival
of the fittest,

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.360
probably most
importantly, trouncing

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.880
of behavior for the good
of the species, group

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.380
selection-type arguments.

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.760
What we saw was, number one, the
rationale for the whole thing.

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.000
There is a vicious,
un-fightable logic

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.280
to why hearts have to be the
size they are and kidneys

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.550
have the filtration
rates they have to have

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:46.410
in order to solve the
challenges of leaving

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.930
as many copies of your genes
in the next generation.

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.260
And making sense of the
evolution of hearts and kidneys

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.400
and things like that
could be the worlds

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.170
of bioengineers and biomechanics
folks with an underlying logic

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.140
that it's got to
be something that

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.130
increases the number of copies
of genes that you leave.

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:06.750
And the whole rationale for
Wednesday's lecture and today

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.330
is applying the same sort
of logic to behavior.

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:14.690
The whole world of just
as you can optimize

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.390
sort of the way one's neck, how
long it is if you're a giraffe,

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.200
you can optimize
behavioral strategies.

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.310
And again, also for
a caveat, no animal

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.550
is sitting there, maybe with the
exception of some other apes,

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.110
sitting there consciously
strategizing along those lines.

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.400
One saying, so what would
you, as this dandelion,

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.240
want to do at that point with
this ecological challenge,

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.880
personifying just to
make things easier.

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:40.390
OK.

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:44.090
What we then barreled into were
the three major building blocks

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.460
for thinking about the
evolution of behavior

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.140
in the framework of contemporary
evolutionary thinking.

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:52.040
Number one,
individual selection--

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.310
passing on as many
copies of your own genes

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.460
to the next
generation as possible

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.430
by way of your own reproducing.

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.460
The individual
selection-- a chicken

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.130
is an egg's way to
make another egg.

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.510
I've now rehearsed that, so
I've got that down right.

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:09.290
The whole notion of behavior as
just being this epi-phenomenon

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:12.780
in order to do what's needed to
get another copy of the genes

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.450
into the next generation.

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:16.770
Building block number two.

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:19.840
Some of the time, the best way
to increase the number of genes

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.610
you pass on to the
next generation

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:25.330
is to help your relatives
do so following that logic

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.560
of Mendelian relatedness.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.720
And people in the
catch-up section, I know,

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.650
went over issues of, why is it
that you share half your genes

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:36.770
with a full sibling, a quarter
with a half sibling, et cetera?

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:41.100
So sometimes the way to maximize
is by helping out a relative

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.570
to do so with,
again, constrained

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:46.360
by this vicious
mathematical logic of,

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.340
it depends on how related
you are to the relative.

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:51.910
And thus, you will
gladly lay down your life

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:55.540
for one identical twin, two
full siblings, eight cousins.

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:56.920
Off you go.

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:00.360
So the whole notion
there of insight into why

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.980
social animals the galaxy
over are so obsessed

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:06.930
with kinship and
relatedness, the whole world

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:10.320
of who counts as an us,
who counts as a them

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.260
in terms of
cooperative behaviors

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.970
playing out along
lines of relatedness.

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:19.310
Finally, we saw the third piece,
which was reciprocal altruism.

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:21.590
You scratch my back,
I'll scratch yours.

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:25.140
Many hands make the task
less scratchy or whatever.

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:27.170
And what you see in
those cases, there

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:30.330
is a whole world
in which you don't

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.640
have to be related
to have cooperation.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.120
And we saw all the
domains of that bringing

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.150
in the formalization--
biomechanics person

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:41.270
figuring out how strong
a leg bone has to be.

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:43.900
A game theorist figuring
out within the realm

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:46.240
of social behavior
when you cooperate

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.990
and when you don't and
what sort of strategies.

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:51.240
Game theory, of seeing
the prisoner's dilemma

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:54.530
as the building block
of that entire field

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:58.640
and seeing all the strategies
worked out by mathematicians

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:02.050
and economists and diplomats
and seeing which ones optimize

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:03.470
under what circumstance.

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:05.340
And then going and
look in the real world

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:08.510
and seeing there's all
sorts of animals out there

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:12.670
that have evolved optimization
strategies of when to cooperate

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:13.990
and when to defect.

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:17.580
And what we'll get to as a huge,
huge issue by the time we get

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:21.040
to the lectures on aggression,
cooperation, et cetera is,

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:24.240
well, that's great when you've
got a cooperative system going.

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:26.080
How do they ever start?

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.890
How do you jump start
cooperation in systems?

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:31.340
The evolution of
cooperation, that's

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:35.150
something we will get to in
great detail down the line.

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:37.790
Finally, what we shifted
to was now saying,

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:40.330
great, we've got all these
principles in hand here

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:43.210
and our big three building
blocks and all of that.

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:46.660
How would it be applied to
making sense of animal behavior

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:47.970
out in the real world?

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:51.430
And we left with the examples
starting someplace there--

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:57.100
where did it go, yes, that's
it-- of us marching through,

00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:00.680
know one individual
factoid about some species

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:02.910
or other species,
know that there's

00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:05.890
a big difference between
the genders in size

00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:08.110
or there isn't, know
that there's not

00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:10.140
high levels of
aggression in males,

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:12.230
know that females
always give birth.

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:15.000
Whatever those traits are
as we marched through,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.210
using these ideas about
individual selection, kin

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:20.410
selection, reciprocal
altruism, you

00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:23.050
could march through
and logically infer

00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:26.060
what the social behavior
of this particular species

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:28.840
was going to be like,
and you would be right.

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:31.780
We saw, for example,
in tournament species,

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:35.500
tournament species where you
have high levels of aggression

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:38.950
among males, male-male
competition for access

00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:39.880
to females.

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:42.780
As a result, males tend to
be a lot bigger than females.

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:45.610
They are being selected
for muscle mass,

00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:48.950
secondary sexual
characteristics, plumage,

00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:51.880
big sharp canines for
slashing the other guy.

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:55.200
Bringing up this issue of,
in a tournament species,

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.250
who does the male
want to mate with?

00:08:57.250 --> 00:09:00.300
What sort of female are males
interested in mating with?

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:01.870
The answer being,
anyone who will

00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:05.030
mate with them because
there's like no cost involved.

00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:08.440
All that's involved is no
parental behavior, none

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:10.190
of that, the cost of sperm.

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:13.020
And literally, people
analyze the relative cost

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:16.260
of sperm versus eggs
in tournament species.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:20.510
Males are dramatically un-choosy
as to who they mate with.

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:23.990
In tournament species, males
have dramatic variability

00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:27.130
in reproductive
success-- 5% accounting

00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:29.240
for 95% of the matings.

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:31.740
Female choice in a
tournament species.

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:33.620
What does a female
want out of a male?

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:36.140
She certainly is not going
to get good fatherhood out

00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:36.650
of the guy.

00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:38.850
All she wants are good
genes because that's

00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:40.810
all she could hope
for from the guy.

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:43.430
A whole world of
female selectivity

00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:46.060
for markers of good genes.

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:48.360
And as we'll see in the
sexual behavior lectures,

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:52.040
a whole world of males
trying to fake out females

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:53.900
across the animal
world, suggesting they

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:56.500
got better genes than
they actually do.

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:58.180
So we will come to that.

00:09:58.180 --> 00:09:59.620
Then tournament species.

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:02.009
Do you see female
abandonment of kids?

00:10:02.009 --> 00:10:04.050
Absolutely not, because
there's nobody else who's

00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:05.340
going to take care of them.

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:07.750
Coupled with that,
you see single births

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:09.830
among those species, low level.

00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:12.150
High levels of aggression
amongst the males,

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:13.810
low levels of parenting.

00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:16.910
And males tend to live a
lot shorter than females.

00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:18.330
And what we saw
at the other end,

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:22.320
the pair-bonded species was a
completely different picture.

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:24.590
Males are being
careful who they're

00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:27.752
mating with because the
wiring there is you mate,

00:10:27.752 --> 00:10:29.400
you take care of the kids.

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:31.560
High levels of male
parenting, females

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:33.510
are thus able to abandon them.

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:35.850
Females can have
multiple births.

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:38.620
Males are selected to
be as close to females

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:39.830
as a male can be.

00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:41.900
So there's not a big
difference in size.

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:44.030
There's not a big difference
in secondary sexual

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:45.010
characteristics.

00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:46.930
There's not high
levels of aggression.

00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:49.030
There's not big
differences in lifespan.

00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:50.940
Who does a female
want to mate with?

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:53.770
Someone who is going to
be a competent father.

00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:56.690
Thus the whole world
of pair-bonded species,

00:10:56.690 --> 00:11:00.360
where males court with
rituals of coming up with food

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:02.310
and coming up with
things of that sort.

00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:04.930
So the most striking thing
about that was, again,

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:07.070
going back to the
two skulls I brought

00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:10.480
in, you could know nothing
more about that species

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:12.560
other than this is
an adult female.

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:13.850
This is an adult male.

00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:15.730
And working through
the same logic,

00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:19.760
you know a huge amount about
the private lives of the species

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:22.040
and who's messing around
with who in the bushes.

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:24.980
And that's merely by
applying these principles.

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:27.200
And likewise saying,
here is a picture

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:29.060
of a pair in this
species and you

00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:31.520
can't tell which one
is who by gender, that

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:33.890
tells you a whole
world of predictability

00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:35.070
at the other end.

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:37.950
So a first example of how
much explanatory power

00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:39.130
you can get out of this.

00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:41.320
And on the website,
I will find all sorts

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:43.710
of appropriate pictures of
tournament and pair-bonding

00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:45.331
species for you to look at.

00:11:45.331 --> 00:11:45.830
OK.

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:48.600
So a first round of
looking at animal behavior

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:51.630
and seeing how once we got
these principles in hand,

00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:54.470
individual selection, kin
selection, reciprocal altruism,

00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:58.140
suddenly an awful lot
of stuff makes sense.

00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:00.080
Next domain where
that's the case.

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:04.160
And this is one that has
had a real challenge to the,

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.440
"Ooh, isn't nature
benign and animals behave

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:08.390
for the good of the
species" viewpoint.

00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:11.930
This one domain probably
proves an individual selection

00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:14.261
framework more than
anything else out there.

00:12:14.261 --> 00:12:14.760
OK.

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:18.290
Back to our inevitable
National Geographic specials.

00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:20.800
And somewhere at the end
of whatever the special is,

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:23.300
about whatever species,
at some point they usually

00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:26.440
get some narrator with some
deep, baritone voice coming

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:28.440
at that stage and
saying something like,

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:31.640
man is the only species
that kills for pleasure.

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:35.330
Man is the only-- and look
at how wonderful and benign

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:36.560
these rosebushes are.

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:37.480
They don't kill.

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:38.610
They don't have war.

00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:39.500
Only humans do.

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:42.480
And what occurred, by
about the mid '70s or so,

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:45.840
was enough field workers from
a different species reporting,

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:46.980
hey, wait a second.

00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:50.080
We're not the only
species that kills.

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:52.010
And we will see
plenty of domains

00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:54.410
where that makes sense
in the lectures to come.

00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:57.150
But one particular
version really,

00:12:57.150 --> 00:13:01.800
really demanded some rethinking
about animal behavior, which

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:02.980
was as follows.

00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:05.930
What is one of the universals,
whether you start with us

00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:08.140
and go all the way
down to slime molds?

00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:10.190
It's babies are cute.

00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:11.520
Everybody likes babies.

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:12.627
Babies are adorable.

00:13:12.627 --> 00:13:13.960
You want to take care of babies.

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:16.410
Your eyes dilate as soon
as you're around them.

00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:20.960
And a longstanding notion that
what infants, what babies,

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:24.080
what baby features are about
are, among other things, are

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:26.350
means to reduce aggression.

00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:29.070
And we will see in the ethology
lecture something about that.

00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:31.600
That was the standard
sound bite forever.

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:34.290
And suddenly, you
got field biologists

00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:36.620
coming back from studying
various species saying,

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:40.390
something's up there,
because in my species

00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:43.730
I see individuals murdering
kids all the time.

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:45.840
Whoa, what's up with that?

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:47.920
Infanticide within a species.

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:51.090
Suddenly, not only are humans
not the only species that

00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:53.220
kills, we're like
not the only one

00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:56.560
who goes and kills adorable,
little, Disney infants.

00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:59.480
Suddenly, all sorts
of species popping up

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:01.400
where there was infanticide.

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:04.640
And the huge challenge then
became to make sense of this.

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:08.850
This first emerged in the
1970s, studies of langur monkeys

00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:12.280
in India by someone named
Sarah Hrdy reporting this.

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:15.260
Soon it was reported among
lions, some other species

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:16.370
as well.

00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:18.990
And the first obvious
response to this was, wait,

00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:21.401
this can't be because I watch
all the wildlife specials.

00:14:21.401 --> 00:14:22.650
There's something [? wrong. ?]

00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:26.080
Oh, there's some sort of
psychopathology going on.

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:28.327
This is not a normal population.

00:14:28.327 --> 00:14:30.160
This is not a normal
population because they

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:31.380
live close to humans.

00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:32.460
There's some disturbance.

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:34.870
There's a toxic
waste dump somewhere.

00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:37.180
They're not a normal
species because you've

00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:40.220
got the wrong color socks on as
the observer, whatever it is.

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:41.510
And this is not normal.

00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:43.630
This is pathological behavior.

00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:46.200
But long enough
time goes by, and it

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:48.420
becomes clear in all
sorts of species,

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:50.590
individuals kill infants.

00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:52.270
So what is this about?

00:14:52.270 --> 00:14:55.830
You start to look closely,
and there's patterns.

00:14:55.830 --> 00:14:57.150
There are patterns to it.

00:14:57.150 --> 00:15:00.080
The first one
being that it tends

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:03.480
to be adult males
who kill infants.

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:05.990
The next being,
you look closely,

00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:09.020
and it's not random
who kills who.

00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:11.580
It's males killing
infants who are

00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:14.640
most likely to be the
offspring of, you guessed it,

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:16.710
individual selection,
most likely to be

00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:19.220
the offspring of other males.

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:22.830
Competitive strategies for
reducing some other guy's

00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:24.940
reproductive success.

00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:27.670
So this began to be seen
in these species that

00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:28.980
had infanticide.

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:33.210
It was male
infanticide of kids who

00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:36.330
were most likely to be the
offspring of other males.

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:39.880
But more patterns popped
up at that time, which is,

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:42.320
well, why don't you see
that in any social species

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:43.610
where you have competition?

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:46.440
And what wound up being
clear after a while is

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:49.800
there's only a certain pattern
that you see in species that

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:54.540
have competitive infanticide,
which is the average interbirth

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:57.450
interval among females is
longer than the average tenure

00:15:57.450 --> 00:15:59.840
of a high-ranking male.

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:00.940
What?

00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:02.240
Here's what that means.

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:04.570
That means you're
some low-ranking guy.

00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:07.380
You've been working out in
the gym for years on end.

00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:10.240
You're finally in the position
to boot out the alpha male

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:11.830
and take over the whole group.

00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:14.277
And damn, every single
female in the group

00:16:14.277 --> 00:16:16.860
has a newborn who they're going
to be nursing for the next two

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:17.550
and a half years.

00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:18.890
So they're not going
to be ovulating,

00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:20.431
and they're not
going to be ovulating

00:16:20.431 --> 00:16:21.350
for about three years.

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:24.520
And you're likely to be alpha
for only a year and a half

00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:27.880
or so, where the length of time,
on average, that you are going

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:30.260
to be able to be
reproductively active

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:32.500
is shorter than
the length of time

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:35.570
that females in your
species nurse kids and thus

00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:36.940
are not ovulating.

00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:40.690
And suddenly, you have
this brutally clear logic

00:16:40.690 --> 00:16:43.290
that makes perfect sense from
everything on Monday, which

00:16:43.290 --> 00:16:46.000
is, go and kill the kids.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.080
Go and kill the kids
for two reasons.

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:52.790
Number one, by killing the
offspring of some other male,

00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:54.530
you are decreasing
that individual's

00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:55.970
reproductive success.

00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:58.450
This competition is leaving
as many copies of your genes,

00:16:58.450 --> 00:16:59.230
et cetera.

00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:02.890
Number two, by killing
an offspring, the female,

00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:05.910
by stopping nursing,
will soon be ovulating.

00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:09.750
And thus, you see this
pattern in langur monkeys,

00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:13.839
vervet monkeys,
patas monkeys, lions,

00:17:13.839 --> 00:17:15.430
mountain gorillas
and such, where

00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:17.119
it's always this structure.

00:17:17.119 --> 00:17:20.720
Competitive infanticide-- a
male takes over a breeding group

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:24.750
and goes about systematically
trying to kill the infants.

00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:28.390
So we've got an enormous
violation there of behavior

00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:31.080
for the good of the species,
and baby animals are cute

00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:33.550
and suppress aggression,
all that sort of thing.

00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:36.730
The clearest demonstration of
that is to look at the fact

00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:39.390
that one of the species
where this goes on

00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:44.110
by this vicious sort of
logic of competition, this

00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:47.010
is one of the species on Earth
that is as close to extinction

00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:49.390
as you can get--
mountain gorillas.

00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:52.050
There's maybe 600,
700 of them are left.

00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:54.980
And these are just
like stunning animals,

00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:58.490
and they are disappearing
because of habitat degradation,

00:17:58.490 --> 00:18:00.360
and human presence,
and civil war

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:02.800
is sweeping through there,
and all that sort of stuff.

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:05.290
But also they are
facing, I think,

00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:08.040
inevitable extinction
in a decade or two

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:11.510
because every now and then,
a male mountain gorilla will

00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:15.290
systematically go and kill
the infants around in a group

00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:16.410
by this logic.

00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:20.390
You can't ask for a much
better demonstration of animals

00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:22.870
not behaving for the
good of the species

00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:27.120
or the group-- this
individual selection strategy.

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:30.150
So immediately we start
applying some rules to this.

00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:35.040
Well, when's a circumstance that
a male would come into a group

00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:37.870
and boot out the previous
reproductive male

00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:40.950
and take over, and
where he wouldn't

00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:44.390
be all that fast to try to kill
all the infants in the group?

00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:46.360
When would a male
take over a group

00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:49.780
and not be all that thrilled to
do this competitive infanticide

00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:51.080
strategy?

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:52.420
Any guesses?

00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:53.690
When he's a brother.

00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:54.860
Yeah.

00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:58.830
Part two, individual
selection, kin selection.

00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:02.570
Kin selection, you don't see
the competitive infanticide

00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:06.730
if the males replacing are
close relatives by exactly

00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:08.210
that logic.

00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:11.870
So then you begin to see some
more elegant stuff going on.

00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:14.880
In some cases, in
a bunch of species,

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:17.870
instead of males killing
infants, what happens

00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:20.800
is the presence of
a new male causes

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:24.430
females to miscarry,
pregnant females to miscarry.

00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:28.200
One version of this, and
this is seen in wild horses,

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:31.460
the new male in there
harasses pregnant females

00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:33.890
to the point of
them miscarrying.

00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:36.140
Same exact logic again.

00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:38.550
In a whole bunch
of rodent species,

00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:40.750
you see something
far more elegant.

00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:44.610
The new male shows up, and if
you were a pregnant female,

00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:49.770
the smell of a new male causes
you to miscarry a litter.

00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:51.780
And the biology
that is completely

00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:54.660
worked out, going from
the olfactory signaling--

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:57.200
and we're going to hear tons
about olfactory signaling

00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:00.120
in weeks to come-- going
from the olfactory system

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:03.250
to release of a
stress hormone that

00:20:03.250 --> 00:20:06.420
disrupts uterine
maturation, and you abort.

00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:09.180
Olfaction-induced abortion.

00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:11.060
What's up with the
female with that?

00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:13.310
Why is that a strategy
for her to leave

00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:16.210
as many copies of her own
genes in the next generation?

00:20:16.210 --> 00:20:19.170
If this guy is around, she's
got a choice at that point,

00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:21.510
a choice, again, metaphorically.

00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:23.030
She has a choice at that point.

00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:26.130
Either she can go through the
rest of the metabolic costs

00:20:26.130 --> 00:20:28.070
of pregnancy, give
birth to these kids,

00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:29.280
and then they get killed.

00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:32.320
Or at least she can take
the lesser of two evils.

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:34.860
[? He ?] spontaneously
aborts at that point.

00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:38.300
And soon after, she is
ovulating and has a chance

00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:41.370
again to pass on copies
of her own genes.

00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:45.040
And this is the whole world
of-- you put a male hamster

00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:47.100
in with a female
who's just had babies,

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:48.730
and he goes and eats the kids.

00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:50.300
Oh, it's psychopathological.

00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:51.800
It's not psychopathological.

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:53.760
Male hamsters are migratory.

00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:57.110
If there are kids there, they're
not likely to have been mine.

00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:58.430
That's the logical thing.

00:20:58.430 --> 00:21:01.440
Females having been
selected for if there

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:05.650
is the smell of a
new male, miscarry.

00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:08.740
And the same logic again
extending, the smell

00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:11.990
of a new male, unless
he's a close relative

00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:13.340
of the previous male.

00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:16.930
You see the exact same
thing playing out there.

00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:20.560
Now, all of this, of course,
is very sort of male-biased

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:21.360
in terms of this.

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:25.170
These are females sort of making
the best of the bad situation.

00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:27.140
You're some female
langur monkey,

00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:29.160
and some new male
has come in and is

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:30.980
intent on being infanticidal.

00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:34.050
And you've read
evolutionary biology also.

00:21:34.050 --> 00:21:36.090
What do you want
to do to maximize

00:21:36.090 --> 00:21:39.300
copies of your own genes
in the next generation?

00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:43.580
Well, you've got this kid here
who you're trying to protect.

00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:47.480
Would you protect that child to
the point of your being killed?

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:48.570
Probably not.

00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:51.210
And you don't see
females doing that.

00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:53.730
Under what circumstance
would a female

00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:57.410
be most motivated to defend
her child to the point of her

00:21:57.410 --> 00:21:59.060
being seriously injured?

00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:01.510
Older females, older
females who are

00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:05.370
less likely to have
another child after that.

00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:08.640
You're on the scene there,
and who else from day one

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:10.740
would be most willing
to get injured

00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:12.550
in order to protect the kid?

00:22:12.550 --> 00:22:16.630
The maternal grandmother, who
has no reproductive potential

00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:17.350
at that point.

00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:19.895
And what you see in
these langur monkeys,

00:22:19.895 --> 00:22:24.150
the females will defend, not
to the point of serious injury.

00:22:24.150 --> 00:22:27.470
The older the mother is, the
more strenuously she defends,

00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:29.810
and the grandmothers
defend even more.

00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:33.890
Following the same logic
here playing out in that way.

00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:36.470
But you also have
another option,

00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:38.820
which is to do something
much more clever.

00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:40.720
And this is not in
the world after you've

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:43.680
given birth, but the world
of when you are pregnant.

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:45.100
Because even in
these species that

00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:47.440
have the competitive
infanticide,

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:49.940
the new male was also
perfectly happy to harass

00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:51.210
a pregnant female.

00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:54.660
What have females evolved in
a number of primate species?

00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:58.550
One of the great, all-time
ways of manipulating males.

00:22:58.550 --> 00:23:00.810
So you're this
pregnant langur monkey,

00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:03.340
and in comes this new male.

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:05.280
And you know you're
going to go through

00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:07.060
like six more
weeks of pregnancy,

00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:08.810
and they're going to
be enormously costly,

00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:10.640
and the damn guy is
going to kill your kids

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:11.730
as soon as they're born.

00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:14.010
And what can you
do and all of that?

00:23:14.010 --> 00:23:17.250
And you come up with something
very clever physiologically.

00:23:17.250 --> 00:23:22.460
You go into what is called
pseudo-estrus, estrus being

00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:25.390
the term for when female
primates are ovulating

00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:27.650
or sexually receptive,
are in heat.

00:23:27.650 --> 00:23:30.360
And most primate species
give external signs

00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:31.530
of when they're ovulating.

00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:33.550
There is engorgement
of all sorts

00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:36.830
of tissues around the vagina
and rear end and stuff

00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:37.970
that humans don't do.

00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:40.640
But they have some of the
physiological residues,

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:42.810
of water retention, for example.

00:23:42.810 --> 00:23:46.424
So you've got all these external
signs of, I am ovulating,

00:23:46.424 --> 00:23:48.590
except you're not ovulating
because you're pregnant.

00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:50.350
You are pseudo-ovulating.

00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:52.610
You are going through
a pseudo-estrus.

00:23:52.610 --> 00:23:54.580
You generate the picture of it.

00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:57.410
So what happens at that
point with this new guy who's

00:23:57.410 --> 00:24:00.560
just shown up, and here's this
like four-month pregnant female

00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:02.810
who nonetheless looks like
she's going through estrus?

00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:05.730
Well, these guys sit there
then and say, well, well,

00:24:05.730 --> 00:24:08.110
that's kind of nice, and
they go and mate with her.

00:24:08.110 --> 00:24:10.744
And like two and a half
weeks later, she gives birth.

00:24:10.744 --> 00:24:12.410
And you know what the
guy's going to do.

00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:14.650
He's going to sit there and
say, what's the gestation period

00:24:14.650 --> 00:24:15.250
in my species?

00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:16.054
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:16.054 --> 00:24:19.770
[INAUDIBLE], what is it, like
five months or something?

00:24:19.770 --> 00:24:24.080
I've been here three weeks,
and already she's given birth.

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:24.940
Whoa, what a guy.

00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:26.110
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:26.110 --> 00:24:27.420
And they fall for it.

00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:29.040
They fall for it every time.

00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:31.900
Females, by having these
pseudo-estrus things,

00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:34.890
the males are not
infanticidal afterward

00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:36.880
when the female gives birth.

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:38.730
So this whole world
that initially

00:24:38.730 --> 00:24:41.790
makes no sense at
all-- oh, my god,

00:24:41.790 --> 00:24:44.640
animals killing members of
their own species, even babies,

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:47.450
making vicious logic
when applying issues

00:24:47.450 --> 00:24:50.990
of individual selection
and the qualifications

00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:52.500
by way of kin selection.

00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:55.700
Next example, another one
with a similar flavor.

00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:57.048
And yeah?

00:24:57.048 --> 00:25:01.420
Wouldn't evolution favor a male
that he didn't figure it out

00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:03.240
that it was his children?

00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:03.780
Yep.

00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:06.980
And I think probably the
most technical, Darwinian way

00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:09.920
of explaining that is the
well-known propensity of blood

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:12.470
flow to either go to
male brains or penises.

00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:15.270
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:15.270 --> 00:25:17.480
They just get impulsive
at that point.

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:21.010
They don't stop to think and
get the gynecology textbook.

00:25:21.010 --> 00:25:23.780
That there no doubt
is an advantage

00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:26.210
for the tiny subset
of male langur monkeys

00:25:26.210 --> 00:25:29.240
who can actually be like
prudent at that point

00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:31.440
and think through the logic.

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:33.610
It works with males.

00:25:33.610 --> 00:25:35.760
They fall for it.

00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:38.230
Suggesting that a lot
of what's going on there

00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:40.890
is not a conscious,
cognitive strategy.

00:25:40.890 --> 00:25:43.410
And this is sort of not
a facetious answer, when

00:25:43.410 --> 00:25:45.650
by the end of next week,
we get to looking at,

00:25:45.650 --> 00:25:48.720
how do animals
recognize individuals?

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:51.632
With a lot of species, there's
not a cognitive strategy.

00:25:51.632 --> 00:25:54.090
You're not able to sit there
and figure out, wait a second,

00:25:54.090 --> 00:25:55.440
this isn't making any sense.

00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:55.940
No.

00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:59.097
I mean, like not that
logically figure it out,

00:25:59.097 --> 00:26:01.532
but [INAUDIBLE]
just favor the males

00:26:01.532 --> 00:26:04.454
that, for any reason,
whether they figure it out,

00:26:04.454 --> 00:26:08.187
they just feel like
[INAUDIBLE] three weeks instead

00:26:08.187 --> 00:26:12.060
of five months [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:13.980
I think what it is
is that there's not

00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:16.230
a whole lot of males
there who could make sense

00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:19.260
or who have been selected
for making sense of the fact

00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:21.450
that mating has something
to do with babies down

00:26:21.450 --> 00:26:23.220
at the other end of things.

00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:25.560
I think there's not been
much selection for being

00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:27.200
able to cognitively do that.

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:31.610
Or to have some sort of rule--
if I mate with this individual,

00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:34.479
any time she
produces a baby, I'm

00:26:34.479 --> 00:26:36.020
going to be unaggressive
to the baby,

00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:38.230
unless it's within
this sort of time span.

00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:40.530
I think that's a little too
much, too fast, [? too ?]

00:26:40.530 --> 00:26:43.320
evolved in sort of
a primate system.

00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:45.540
The males fall for it.

00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:48.000
Another version with a
lot of the same logic.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.700
And this became clear-- studies
of baboons, Savannah baboons,

00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:54.200
in the early '60s,
which is you would

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:56.390
have some male,
who male was having

00:26:56.390 --> 00:26:58.180
a tension with
another adult male.

00:26:58.180 --> 00:27:00.630
And they're about to have
some sort of clear fight,

00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:03.639
and one guy is
obviously low ranking,

00:27:03.639 --> 00:27:04.930
and he's going to get trounced.

00:27:04.930 --> 00:27:07.260
And here comes the
big, high-ranking male,

00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:08.420
and this guy is terrified.

00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:09.940
And what does he do?

00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:13.310
He looks around frantically
and grabs a baby

00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:16.170
and holds it to his chest.

00:27:16.170 --> 00:27:18.460
1950s National
Geographic special.

00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:19.700
Why is he doing that?

00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:23.950
Because infants are comforting,
because babies are cute.

00:27:23.950 --> 00:27:25.780
And everybody becomes
less aggressive

00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:27.830
when there's a baby
around, because oh, my god,

00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:29.663
who would attack somebody
holding an infant?

00:27:29.663 --> 00:27:30.950
What if the infant's injured?

00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:31.560
OK.

00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:33.900
So that's the old version.

00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:36.690
So applying some
contemporary interpretations,

00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:39.910
what you wind up seeing, along
comes the threatening male.

00:27:39.910 --> 00:27:43.610
The subordinate male grabs
an infant and holds it.

00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:46.790
And what you only begin to
see after a while of studying

00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:51.050
individuals is, it's not
random which infant he grabs.

00:27:51.050 --> 00:27:52.590
And you know
exactly what's going

00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:54.450
to come next, a
very similar theme

00:27:54.450 --> 00:27:56.250
to the competitive infanticide.

00:27:56.250 --> 00:27:59.670
When males are doing
"kidnapping" like this,

00:27:59.670 --> 00:28:01.380
and that is the
term to use, they're

00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:03.390
not randomly grabbing kids.

00:28:03.390 --> 00:28:06.000
They're grabbing kids
who are likely to be

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.810
the offspring of that male.

00:28:07.810 --> 00:28:10.990
And it is very clear at
that point, mess with me,

00:28:10.990 --> 00:28:13.079
and your kid's going to get it.

00:28:13.079 --> 00:28:14.620
And it's clearly
not being played out

00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:16.870
in any sort of conscious
level like that.

00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:20.350
But what you see
is, it's not random.

00:28:20.350 --> 00:28:22.600
And it comes with the
sort of qualifiers

00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:25.770
that show you even more
how the system is working.

00:28:25.770 --> 00:28:29.590
So you've got some guy who's
a big, high-ranking male

00:28:29.590 --> 00:28:32.390
and has obviously fathered all
sorts of kids in the troop.

00:28:32.390 --> 00:28:34.460
And you're about to
trounce this smaller

00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:36.970
guy who grabs one of the kids
who's more likely to be his

00:28:36.970 --> 00:28:37.800
than yours.

00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:41.690
Logical competitive strategy
of essentially blackmail.

00:28:41.690 --> 00:28:44.430
You've got a big,
high-ranking male

00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:46.850
who's dominating everybody
else, except he only

00:28:46.850 --> 00:28:49.070
joined the troop two weeks ago.

00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:51.110
In other words, there's
not been enough time

00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:53.130
for him to have kids yet.

00:28:53.130 --> 00:28:55.430
When he is threatening
lower-ranking guys,

00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:58.100
they're less likely
to kidnap against him

00:28:58.100 --> 00:29:00.250
than kidnap against
the high-ranking male

00:29:00.250 --> 00:29:02.520
with a long residency.

00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:04.660
And what you find
even more interesting,

00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:06.890
which throws you into
this world of, well,

00:29:06.890 --> 00:29:09.330
are these guys consciously
thinking about this,

00:29:09.330 --> 00:29:14.360
or do they just smell that
that kid is that guy's kid,

00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:15.780
and do they just know?

00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:18.260
In primates, they're
thinking about it.

00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:20.490
And the way to realize
that is when they

00:29:20.490 --> 00:29:23.090
screw up and make a mistake.

00:29:23.090 --> 00:29:26.670
And this one, sort of years ago
I was watching some baboons,

00:29:26.670 --> 00:29:28.265
and there was this
low-ranking guy.

00:29:28.265 --> 00:29:30.640
He was actually middle ranking,
and this high-ranking guy

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:31.750
was coming at him.

00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:35.200
And he was a middle-ranking guy
who critically was on his way

00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:35.700
down.

00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:37.660
He used to be a
high-ranking guy.

00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:38.870
He was aging.

00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:42.250
In other words, he used to
be reproductively active.

00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:45.480
In other words, there's some of
his kids around in the troop.

00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:47.150
So he's sitting
there, and here comes

00:29:47.150 --> 00:29:50.520
this terrifying, high-ranking
male who's coming at him.

00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:53.850
And our guy gets all agitated,
nervous, looks around,

00:29:53.850 --> 00:29:57.220
and he grabs a kid, and
it's likely to be his kid.

00:29:57.220 --> 00:29:58.584
He's grabbed his own kid.

00:29:58.584 --> 00:30:00.250
Oh, my god, you're
sitting there saying,

00:30:00.250 --> 00:30:02.291
I'm never going to get a
damn thesis out of this.

00:30:02.291 --> 00:30:04.890
These animals just ruined
all the theoretical models.

00:30:04.890 --> 00:30:06.397
He's grabbing the wrong kid.

00:30:06.397 --> 00:30:08.730
So he's holding the kid there,
and you're sitting there.

00:30:08.730 --> 00:30:12.220
And you could see the guy's
about five steps away, and he--

00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:14.460
so he tosses the
kid in the air--

00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:14.960
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:16.460
--just as he's attacked.

00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:20.640
You will see they act as if
they have made a mistake.

00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:23.670
They are consciously working
around something like this.

00:30:23.670 --> 00:30:28.630
So this whole notion of coercive
blackmail and kidnapping,

00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:31.190
again, it only
makes sense once you

00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:34.320
begin to see the structures
of individual selection, kin

00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:36.610
selection, reciprocal altruism.

00:30:36.610 --> 00:30:40.810
Another example, and this one
makes perfect sense instantly.

00:30:40.810 --> 00:30:43.480
You look at the world
of female primates

00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:46.880
in lots of different species,
and there's ranking systems.

00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:48.030
There is a hierarchy.

00:30:48.030 --> 00:30:50.150
And what's the
hierarchy built around?

00:30:50.150 --> 00:30:53.740
You get a rank one below
that of your mother.

00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:55.540
You inherit your rank.

00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:57.550
Your mom is the alpha female.

00:30:57.550 --> 00:31:00.580
You're her first daughter,
so you're number two.

00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:02.930
And as soon as she
has another daughter,

00:31:02.930 --> 00:31:05.380
your kid sister is
number three, until you

00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:08.120
have a first daughter, who
pushes your kid sister down

00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:08.840
one step.

00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:10.940
In other words,
dominance hierarchies

00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:14.080
amongst the females are
entirely nepotistic.

00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:14.850
Whoa.

00:31:14.850 --> 00:31:17.095
How can you explain that?

00:31:17.095 --> 00:31:19.710
Part number two, kin selection.

00:31:19.710 --> 00:31:22.960
Dominance systems in all
sorts of social species

00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:26.080
are built around the
nepotism of relatedness.

00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:28.180
So that makes sense.

00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:31.210
Next one, next
interesting notion here,

00:31:31.210 --> 00:31:34.140
which is one of those
choices, one of those choices

00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:35.640
that are not conscious choices.

00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:37.280
But you're about
to get pregnant,

00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:40.150
and you have a choice, as
whatever species you are,

00:31:40.150 --> 00:31:42.514
do you want to have
a male or a female,

00:31:42.514 --> 00:31:44.680
or do you want to have a
litter of males or females,

00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:46.721
or do you want have a
litter that's predominantly

00:31:46.721 --> 00:31:48.080
male or predominantly female?

00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:51.780
And it comes down to an issue
now of two things, which

00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:56.450
is, how much does it cost to
have a female versus a male

00:31:56.450 --> 00:31:57.720
during pregnancy?

00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:00.570
And what are the
reproductive probabilities

00:32:00.570 --> 00:32:02.770
of having a male
versus a female?

00:32:02.770 --> 00:32:03.730
Back to this issue.

00:32:03.730 --> 00:32:06.040
You are in a big
tournament species.

00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:09.360
And as we saw, there's high
degrees of male variability

00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:10.950
in reproductive success.

00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:16.500
5% of the guys are accounting
for 95% of the matings.

00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:19.030
So you sit there,
and what you've got

00:32:19.030 --> 00:32:24.180
is a rule that if you go for a
son-- like 90% of sons running

00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:26.130
around there are never
going to reproduce.

00:32:26.130 --> 00:32:29.340
And you hit the jackpot and you
have the 5% at the very top,

00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:31.370
and each of them are
going to like father

00:32:31.370 --> 00:32:35.600
30 different kids, going for
males in a tournament species

00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:37.270
is a big gamble.

00:32:37.270 --> 00:32:39.390
It's a risky move.

00:32:39.390 --> 00:32:41.350
Going for a female,
however, there

00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:43.920
is no female primate
out there who

00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:48.060
has 420 kids because she
lays eggs like a salmon.

00:32:48.060 --> 00:32:50.910
Most females there, unless they
have some fertility problem,

00:32:50.910 --> 00:32:53.730
they all have something
roughly one to five kids

00:32:53.730 --> 00:32:57.210
or so over the course of the
life of an old-world primate.

00:32:57.210 --> 00:32:59.830
So female variability
is way down.

00:32:59.830 --> 00:33:03.250
In other words, what's
a conservative strategy

00:33:03.250 --> 00:33:04.920
to pass on copies of your genes?

00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:06.050
Have a daughter.

00:33:06.050 --> 00:33:08.020
What's a riskier strategy?

00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:09.460
Have a son.

00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:13.050
And what that immediately
predicts is two things.

00:33:13.050 --> 00:33:16.150
Number one, you look in
dominance hierarchies,

00:33:16.150 --> 00:33:19.960
and the prediction is that
females who are high ranking

00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:22.990
should show more of a
tendency towards having sons

00:33:22.990 --> 00:33:24.110
than daughters.

00:33:24.110 --> 00:33:27.830
And females who are low
ranking, exactly the opposite.

00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:31.190
And that's what you see in
a bunch of primate species

00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:33.390
that have this
sort of structure.

00:33:33.390 --> 00:33:35.020
Next prediction.

00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:39.210
You should then predict that
when ecological circumstances

00:33:39.210 --> 00:33:42.470
get tough, when
times are tough, you

00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:45.260
want to go for the
offspring that costs less.

00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:47.560
A female fetus is
less calorically

00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:49.320
demanding than a male fetus.

00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:53.370
Male fetuses cost more to
bring to term than females do.

00:33:53.370 --> 00:33:57.320
The prediction should be, during
times of ecological pressure,

00:33:57.320 --> 00:34:01.010
the percentage of females
being born should increase.

00:34:01.010 --> 00:34:02.960
And as a measure of
the fact that males

00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:05.150
are more expensive
as fetuses, something

00:34:05.150 --> 00:34:09.020
like 53% of
fertilizations in humans

00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:13.239
are males, about a
53% to 47% ratio.

00:34:13.239 --> 00:34:15.219
And over the course
of pregnancy,

00:34:15.219 --> 00:34:18.230
the cost, the increased
metabolic vulnerability

00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:21.650
of male fetuses, are such that
by the time birth comes around,

00:34:21.650 --> 00:34:23.820
it's around 51-49.

00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:26.300
And it's not until
adolescence that it flips over

00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:28.960
to the typical pattern
of female dominance.

00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:31.170
You've got to have
more male fetuses

00:34:31.170 --> 00:34:33.739
to start off with because
they are more expensive, more

00:34:33.739 --> 00:34:34.650
vulnerable.

00:34:34.650 --> 00:34:38.030
So this prediction during
times of ecological duress,

00:34:38.030 --> 00:34:40.860
you should get a bias
towards more females

00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:44.350
being born, the 50/50 ratio
skewing in that direction.

00:34:44.350 --> 00:34:47.340
And that's precisely
what you wind up seeing.

00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:49.750
And you see all sorts
of examples of this.

00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:53.790
In humans, for example,
during periods of famine,

00:34:53.790 --> 00:34:57.470
food deprivation, the ratio of
births skew towards females.

00:34:57.470 --> 00:35:01.480
What you also see as a measure
of that is among humans,

00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:06.370
a boy, giving birth to a
boy, statistically decreases

00:35:06.370 --> 00:35:08.760
the body weight, is likely
to decrease the body

00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:10.360
weight, of the next offspring.

00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:13.300
It's expensive having
one of those males.

00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:14.950
And what you wind
up getting, then,

00:35:14.950 --> 00:35:19.140
is fluctuation as a function
of your dominance rank.

00:35:19.140 --> 00:35:21.620
If you're high ranking,
it's almost always

00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:24.720
worth the gamble to go for one
of those high-risk, high-payoff

00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:25.480
boys.

00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:28.020
If you're low ranking, go
for the far more conservative

00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:28.860
female.

00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:32.576
You've got this fluctuation
around this 50-50 ratio.

00:35:32.576 --> 00:35:33.950
And this was
something worked out

00:35:33.950 --> 00:35:36.669
by one of the sort
of founding figures

00:35:36.669 --> 00:35:38.710
[? just through ?] modern
evolutionary thinking--

00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:41.760
a guy named Robert
Trivers in the 1970s,

00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:45.900
sex ratio fluctuation as a
function of social context.

00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:49.890
And people have gone and
looked, and it's precisely this.

00:35:49.890 --> 00:35:52.140
And you get an interesting
bit of conservatism

00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:55.970
in this, though, which is
there's some circumstance where

00:35:55.970 --> 00:35:59.080
it makes perfect sense for
you to have a gazillion

00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:01.290
daughters because that's
the time to do it.

00:36:01.290 --> 00:36:03.905
And at some point, you're
having a gazillion daughters,

00:36:03.905 --> 00:36:06.030
and everybody else is having
a gazillion daughters.

00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:09.750
And suddenly, males become
really valuable because there's

00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:11.160
not a whole lot of them around.

00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:12.590
So the logical
thing to do then is

00:36:12.590 --> 00:36:14.490
to switch over and
start having males.

00:36:14.490 --> 00:36:16.705
And everything else being
equal, after a while,

00:36:16.705 --> 00:36:18.900
with a predominance of
males, it's going to make

00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:20.680
sense to switch over to females.

00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:24.460
You have density-dependent
selection you will always

00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:27.620
have oscillating around 50%.

00:36:27.620 --> 00:36:31.040
Whichever sex is in
the smaller number,

00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:33.740
that one is immediately
more preferable.

00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:36.390
Poor ecological conditions
pushes you this way.

00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:38.670
Dominance rank push you
one way or the other.

00:36:38.670 --> 00:36:40.140
But in any of those
circumstances,

00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:42.450
you have an oscillation
around the mean.

00:36:42.450 --> 00:36:45.810
Whichever is more common
is less desirable.

00:36:45.810 --> 00:36:48.300
So sex ratio fluctuation.

00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:49.450
More stuff.

00:36:49.450 --> 00:36:52.770
Role of kinship, for
example, in vervet monkeys.

00:36:52.770 --> 00:36:54.700
We talked about
that the other day.

00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:57.290
Play the sound, an
infant alarm call,

00:36:57.290 --> 00:36:59.710
and the mother
gets all agitated,

00:36:59.710 --> 00:37:01.980
and everyone else
looks at the mother.

00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:03.370
They know that
she is the mother.

00:37:03.370 --> 00:37:06.380
Sort of demonstration of
awareness of kinship there.

00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:09.850
Now, another very
interesting social structure

00:37:09.850 --> 00:37:13.690
to some species, which is we've
seen all of these tournament

00:37:13.690 --> 00:37:14.650
species.

00:37:14.650 --> 00:37:18.950
You have one high-ranking male
mating with lots of females

00:37:18.950 --> 00:37:22.170
and all that sort of stuff
and polygamous systems.

00:37:22.170 --> 00:37:25.270
What about polyandry--
circumstances

00:37:25.270 --> 00:37:28.460
where a female is mating
with multiple males?

00:37:28.460 --> 00:37:31.660
What about circumstances
of stable polyandry,

00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:34.590
where you get, in effect,
the inverse of a harem?

00:37:34.590 --> 00:37:38.680
You get a single breeding
female with a number of males?

00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:42.260
And what is seen with a
very, very high predominance

00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:45.930
is when polyandry occurs,
you get a type which

00:37:45.930 --> 00:37:49.270
is called adelphic polyandry.

00:37:49.270 --> 00:37:51.480
And the second I
tell what it is,

00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:53.630
it will make perfect,
wonderful sense.

00:37:53.630 --> 00:37:54.140
OK.

00:37:54.140 --> 00:37:57.770
Two male lions sharing a pride?

00:37:57.770 --> 00:37:59.640
That's like not what
you're supposed to see.

00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:04.170
It's one male lion, and
Mufasa and his, like, brother

00:38:04.170 --> 00:38:05.220
gets pushed out of there.

00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:06.594
And like, that's
not what you see

00:38:06.594 --> 00:38:08.080
when you study Disney lions.

00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:09.580
There's supposed
to be only one male

00:38:09.580 --> 00:38:11.120
is the breeder in the pride.

00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:13.160
And occasionally
you see these prides

00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:14.910
where instead there
were two males.

00:38:14.910 --> 00:38:16.910
How can they pull that off?

00:38:16.910 --> 00:38:19.880
They should be doing competitive
infanticide, all of that.

00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:21.630
Who were the two males?

00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:24.870
Yes, you guessed it
somewhere up there before.

00:38:24.870 --> 00:38:26.650
It'll be two brothers.

00:38:26.650 --> 00:38:31.190
When you see cases of two
male lions sharing a pride,

00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:33.540
or flip the other
way, when you see

00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:36.150
a pride being willing to
tolerate two males in there

00:38:36.150 --> 00:38:39.150
instead of one, very,
very high likelihood

00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:40.430
that they are brothers.

00:38:40.430 --> 00:38:43.580
This technical term--
"adelphic polyandry."

00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:47.200
And you wind up seeing
one totally wild example

00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:49.350
of this in humans.

00:38:49.350 --> 00:38:52.219
As I went over the other
day, looking at our humans,

00:38:52.219 --> 00:38:54.010
tournament species,
[? the ?] pair bonding.

00:38:54.010 --> 00:38:55.384
We're somewhere
stuck in between.

00:38:55.384 --> 00:38:56.740
We're terribly confused.

00:38:56.740 --> 00:39:00.655
What you see is most cultures
traditionally allow polygamy,

00:39:00.655 --> 00:39:03.030
but most people are not actually
polygamous, all of that.

00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:05.404
And somewhere in there, you
got to ask the same question.

00:39:05.404 --> 00:39:09.000
Hey, is there any polyandry
going on with humans?

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:12.440
And there is one wild
cultural example of this.

00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:15.840
And this is seen in
traditional Tibetan society,

00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:19.520
and there you get
adelphic polyandry.

00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:22.530
You have the following
structure in rural areas.

00:39:22.530 --> 00:39:25.020
A woman will marry a man.

00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:26.650
And in the process,
she will marry

00:39:26.650 --> 00:39:29.950
him along with all of his
brothers, all his brothers.

00:39:29.950 --> 00:39:32.240
She marries the
entire lot of them.

00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:34.350
It is adelphic polyandry.

00:39:34.350 --> 00:39:35.340
And you see that.

00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:37.160
And like it's down
to the point where

00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:39.340
here's this woman
with her husband

00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:41.340
and his younger brother
and his younger brother,

00:39:41.340 --> 00:39:43.090
all the way down to
this infant that she's

00:39:43.090 --> 00:39:45.310
holding, who's the
youngest brother who's

00:39:45.310 --> 00:39:46.690
now one of her husbands.

00:39:46.690 --> 00:39:48.640
And that's what you see.

00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:50.285
What's the explanation for this?

00:39:50.285 --> 00:39:53.660
This is a pattern that
you get in agriculturally

00:39:53.660 --> 00:39:56.710
very impoverished areas
where you got a problem.

00:39:56.710 --> 00:39:59.020
You've got five
sons or whatever.

00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:01.590
And with a pattern
of land inheritance

00:40:01.590 --> 00:40:04.760
where you would otherwise split
up the land amongst the five

00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:06.750
sons, that's going
to put each of them

00:40:06.750 --> 00:40:08.380
below subsistence level.

00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:11.190
What you need to do is
have a way in which they

00:40:11.190 --> 00:40:15.160
remain as one reproductive unit
so you don't split up the land.

00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:18.760
You see this adelphic
polyandry, a woman marrying

00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:20.940
this whole bunch of brothers.

00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:22.900
And it's in
circumstances where it's

00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:25.910
trying to keep the small farm
plots from being broken up.

00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:28.790
But again, the logic
there is the same

00:40:28.790 --> 00:40:32.920
as you see in lions with two
brothers sharing a pride.

00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:33.900
What else?

00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:35.810
Now, somewhere in
there, you begin

00:40:35.810 --> 00:40:38.640
to get in a realization
that not only do

00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:41.740
you have males competing with
males for reproductive success

00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:43.680
and females with
females, but there's

00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:46.240
intersexual competition.

00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:47.620
How could this be?

00:40:47.620 --> 00:40:50.020
How could a planet that
comes up with Valentine's Day

00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:51.880
have intersexual competition?

00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:55.240
What is obvious is the
reproductive interests

00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:57.720
of any given
individual may not be

00:40:57.720 --> 00:40:59.640
exactly the same
as the individual

00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:01.850
she or he mates with.

00:41:01.850 --> 00:41:04.330
What would be an
example of this?

00:41:04.330 --> 00:41:09.420
Here you have a species in
which males are migratory.

00:41:09.420 --> 00:41:11.010
It's a tournament species.

00:41:11.010 --> 00:41:14.650
A male shows up during a mating
season, lots of aggression,

00:41:14.650 --> 00:41:16.610
lots of secondary
sexual whatever.

00:41:16.610 --> 00:41:19.670
And he mates with a
female, and she has kids.

00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:21.140
Hooray.

00:41:21.140 --> 00:41:25.030
They have parented an offspring,
and they've shared their genes

00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:26.840
and increased their
reproductive success.

00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:29.010
Except this being
the species, this guy

00:41:29.010 --> 00:41:31.950
is going to pack up
and leave the next day.

00:41:31.950 --> 00:41:34.990
In other words, he
has no investment

00:41:34.990 --> 00:41:37.620
in the future reproductive
health of that female,

00:41:37.620 --> 00:41:39.810
whereas she sure does.

00:41:39.810 --> 00:41:42.440
She would be delighted
for this offspring

00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:46.140
to thrive and prosper, but
perhaps not at the cost

00:41:46.140 --> 00:41:47.940
of her future reproduction.

00:41:47.940 --> 00:41:50.840
What we see here is, between
the male and the female,

00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:53.090
different reproductive
strategies.

00:41:53.090 --> 00:41:56.400
And this opens up a
whole bizarre world

00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:59.360
of intersexual competition.

00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:02.370
Here's one really bizarre
manifestation of this.

00:42:02.370 --> 00:42:02.870
OK.

00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:04.940
Basic Mendelian genetics.

00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:06.896
Those of you who got
the catch-up this week

00:42:06.896 --> 00:42:08.270
should have a
vague sense of this

00:42:08.270 --> 00:42:10.610
by now, Hardy-Weinberg ratios.

00:42:10.610 --> 00:42:14.440
You've got one parent
has one genotype,

00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:17.890
just to distinguish the parents
and changes the colors there,

00:42:17.890 --> 00:42:18.510
all of that.

00:42:18.510 --> 00:42:21.970
What is it that isn't bothered
with from day one when you

00:42:21.970 --> 00:42:23.836
learn these sorts of things?

00:42:23.836 --> 00:42:25.460
It doesn't matter
which one is the male

00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:26.980
and which is the female,
which is the father

00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:28.260
and which is the mother.

00:42:28.260 --> 00:42:30.320
This is just one
of them contributes

00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:31.790
this profile, one that.

00:42:31.790 --> 00:42:33.450
What pops out the other side?

00:42:33.450 --> 00:42:35.570
Basic Mendelian genetics.

00:42:35.570 --> 00:42:37.480
When making sense
of pedigrees, it

00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:39.770
doesn't matter which
parent is contributing

00:42:39.770 --> 00:42:42.380
the homozygotic profile,
the heterozygotic.

00:42:42.380 --> 00:42:44.530
It doesn't matter which parent.

00:42:44.530 --> 00:42:48.900
But then, there is a whole
world of genetic traits

00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:52.450
where, in fact, it does matter
which parent it comes from,

00:42:52.450 --> 00:42:56.430
because the same
combination of alleles

00:42:56.430 --> 00:42:59.610
will function differently
whether it came from the mother

00:42:59.610 --> 00:43:01.330
or from the father.

00:43:01.330 --> 00:43:05.100
And this was a field that sort
of emerged in the early 1990s,

00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:09.340
and these are called imprinted
genes, imprinted genes.

00:43:09.340 --> 00:43:12.410
These are genes where, for
our purposes to define them,

00:43:12.410 --> 00:43:16.370
these are genes which have
different manifestations,

00:43:16.370 --> 00:43:18.410
different phenotypic
consequences.

00:43:18.410 --> 00:43:21.250
These are genes that work
differently depending

00:43:21.250 --> 00:43:23.800
on which parent they came from.

00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:26.450
Mendel rolling in his grave.

00:43:26.450 --> 00:43:28.480
This is not how it's
supposed to work.

00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:32.690
This obscure world of
imprinted genes violates this.

00:43:32.690 --> 00:43:35.450
They work differently
depending on which parent

00:43:35.450 --> 00:43:37.140
you get it from.

00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:41.080
Dramatic foreshadowing-- when
we get to the ethology lecture,

00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:43.110
the word "imprinting" is
going to come up again

00:43:43.110 --> 00:43:44.530
in a totally different sense.

00:43:44.530 --> 00:43:47.080
This is a purely
molecular term right now.

00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:47.580
OK.

00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:51.250
So you get imprinted
genes, imprinted genes.

00:43:51.250 --> 00:43:53.690
People began to figure
this out in the '90s,

00:43:53.690 --> 00:43:57.220
that, wait a second, we've got
a completely different profile

00:43:57.220 --> 00:43:58.970
in these individuals
with a mutation

00:43:58.970 --> 00:44:00.680
and a particular disease.

00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:02.980
Here we have these two
very different diseases,

00:44:02.980 --> 00:44:05.420
and they turn out to have
the exact same mutation

00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:06.210
in the same gene.

00:44:06.210 --> 00:44:07.390
What's up with that?

00:44:07.390 --> 00:44:11.380
If you get that gene from this
parent, you get this disease.

00:44:11.380 --> 00:44:14.150
If you get it from that
parent, you get that disease.

00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:17.600
Totally boggling,
making no sense at all.

00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:19.610
First thing to
have to be solved.

00:44:19.610 --> 00:44:23.320
What's a mechanism for actually
making a gene work differently

00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:25.500
depending on which
parent it comes from?

00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:27.660
For those who care about
these sorts of details,

00:44:27.660 --> 00:44:30.570
it's a biochemical process
called methylation.

00:44:30.570 --> 00:44:33.890
You methylate the gene in
one parent's genome and not

00:44:33.890 --> 00:44:34.680
the other.

00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:35.930
Don't worry about the details.

00:44:35.930 --> 00:44:39.580
The main way is there is a
genetic mechanism for making

00:44:39.580 --> 00:44:44.410
genes work differently depending
on which parent it comes from.

00:44:44.410 --> 00:44:46.130
So OK, we know how to do it.

00:44:46.130 --> 00:44:47.440
Why should this happen?

00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:49.330
Why does this make any sense?

00:44:49.330 --> 00:44:53.640
And it took a while, and people
began to see patterns to this.

00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:55.970
And finally this
was put together

00:44:55.970 --> 00:44:58.040
by an evolutionary
biologist at Harvard

00:44:58.040 --> 00:45:00.510
named David Haig in
the early '90s, who

00:45:00.510 --> 00:45:04.680
came up with a unifying
theory which explains it all.

00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:06.550
And it's very cool.

00:45:06.550 --> 00:45:08.160
Here's what you see.

00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:11.310
You begin to look
at imprinted genes.

00:45:11.310 --> 00:45:14.250
And for our purposes, the
way we can describe them

00:45:14.250 --> 00:45:18.040
is, this is a gene where if
you get it from one parent,

00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:19.670
it does what it's
supposed to do.

00:45:19.670 --> 00:45:22.710
If you get it from another
parent, it's silenced.

00:45:22.710 --> 00:45:23.600
It never works.

00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:25.640
It's methylated into silence.

00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:27.190
These are imprinted genes.

00:45:27.190 --> 00:45:29.220
So he began to notice something.

00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:32.560
When you look at
imprinted genes where

00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:35.860
they are active if they
come from the father,

00:45:35.860 --> 00:45:41.150
they all tend to be genes
that promote fetal growth.

00:45:41.150 --> 00:45:44.790
They're all genes that
increase fetal metabolism.

00:45:44.790 --> 00:45:48.870
They're all genes that
make for a thicker uterus.

00:45:48.870 --> 00:45:51.360
They're all genes driven
by hormones coming out

00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:52.100
of the fetus.

00:45:52.100 --> 00:45:56.690
They're all genes that push
for greater fetal development.

00:45:56.690 --> 00:45:59.750
And then you look at the
imprinted genes coming

00:45:59.750 --> 00:46:02.310
from the female, and
they're all genes

00:46:02.310 --> 00:46:05.560
that tend to slow down
fetal development.

00:46:05.560 --> 00:46:07.170
What have we got here?

00:46:07.170 --> 00:46:10.330
We've got that intersexual
competition played out

00:46:10.330 --> 00:46:11.730
precisely there.

00:46:11.730 --> 00:46:14.430
You've got this
male hamster who's

00:46:14.430 --> 00:46:16.020
going to mate and
never be seen again

00:46:16.020 --> 00:46:17.384
because he's in this category.

00:46:17.384 --> 00:46:18.300
And what does he want?

00:46:18.300 --> 00:46:21.400
He could care less what happens
to the future reproductive

00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:22.740
success of this female.

00:46:22.740 --> 00:46:25.670
He wants this offspring
of his to survive.

00:46:25.670 --> 00:46:29.330
The male imprinted genes
push for greater amounts

00:46:29.330 --> 00:46:30.710
of fetal growth.

00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:32.540
And the female ones
saying, well, that'll

00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:34.310
be great if this kid
survives, but I also

00:46:34.310 --> 00:46:36.740
have a future reproductive
life to think about.

00:46:36.740 --> 00:46:39.250
Her imprinted genes
tend to counter it.

00:46:39.250 --> 00:46:41.310
What would this look like?

00:46:41.310 --> 00:46:43.870
One of the imprinted genes,
first ones identified,

00:46:43.870 --> 00:46:47.080
which comes [? from ?]
active from the male, codes

00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:52.350
for a protein called
insulin-like growth factor.

00:46:52.350 --> 00:46:54.810
Who cares what insulin-like
growth factor does?

00:46:54.810 --> 00:46:57.210
What's clear from the name
is it's a growth factor.

00:46:57.210 --> 00:47:00.480
It's one of those things
that make fetuses grow more.

00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:02.900
It promotes fetal growth.

00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:05.070
And then meanwhile,
the female hamster

00:47:05.070 --> 00:47:08.300
has a cognate, an
opposing imprinted gene.

00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:10.010
What's that one for?

00:47:10.010 --> 00:47:13.740
That codes the gene for the
insulin-like growth factor

00:47:13.740 --> 00:47:15.280
receptor.

00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:17.290
And what her
version does is make

00:47:17.290 --> 00:47:19.570
for a less responsive receptor.

00:47:19.570 --> 00:47:23.030
The male was pushing for more of
the insulin-like growth factor.

00:47:23.030 --> 00:47:26.030
She gets a receptor
that's not as responsive.

00:47:26.030 --> 00:47:29.510
And you literally have this
co-evolutionary arms race

00:47:29.510 --> 00:47:32.750
there of male imprinted
genes evolving to push

00:47:32.750 --> 00:47:34.320
for more and more fetal growth.

00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:37.940
Female ones pushing for
less and less fetal growth.

00:47:37.940 --> 00:47:40.730
And you see that coming
out most apparently

00:47:40.730 --> 00:47:43.990
when you see mutations
in some of these genes.

00:47:43.990 --> 00:47:47.030
For example, another pair
of imprinted genes, one

00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:48.620
from the father,
one from the mother,

00:47:48.620 --> 00:47:53.620
and what you see there
is the father's version

00:47:53.620 --> 00:47:58.330
promotes invasion, placental
invasion, into the uterus.

00:47:58.330 --> 00:47:59.800
And that's actually
the term that

00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:02.770
gynecologists use,
invasion of the fetus

00:48:02.770 --> 00:48:04.710
into the uterine wall.

00:48:04.710 --> 00:48:06.240
It promotes more of that.

00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:09.180
The female version
slows it down.

00:48:09.180 --> 00:48:11.310
So what if you have
a disease where

00:48:11.310 --> 00:48:14.660
the male gene relevant to this
is mutated and knocked out

00:48:14.660 --> 00:48:15.740
of action?

00:48:15.740 --> 00:48:18.590
You solely have
the female input,

00:48:18.590 --> 00:48:23.060
which is decreasing fetal
implantation into the uterus.

00:48:23.060 --> 00:48:24.270
What have you got then?

00:48:24.270 --> 00:48:29.030
You've got a disease where
fertilized eggs don't implant.

00:48:29.030 --> 00:48:30.840
On the other side,
suppose there's

00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:34.250
a mutation in the female
part of this pairing.

00:48:34.250 --> 00:48:37.160
And as a result, all you
have is the male input

00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:41.040
driving for more and more
aggressive fetal invasion.

00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:42.110
What do you have?

00:48:42.110 --> 00:48:45.400
You wind up with one of
the all time bad cancers

00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:47.890
you don't want to
get, choriocarcinoma,

00:48:47.890 --> 00:48:49.950
a cancer of the
uterus, because it's

00:48:49.950 --> 00:48:52.130
growing completely
out of control

00:48:52.130 --> 00:48:53.830
being prompted by the fetus.

00:48:53.830 --> 00:48:56.820
When you take out each of the
voices through a mutation,

00:48:56.820 --> 00:48:58.910
you see that normally
you're having

00:48:58.910 --> 00:49:03.360
this tilting, this balancing,
of competition between males

00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:06.070
pushing for more fetal
growth at the expense

00:49:06.070 --> 00:49:09.030
of the future reproductive
success of the female, females

00:49:09.030 --> 00:49:10.310
trying to slow it down.

00:49:10.310 --> 00:49:12.920
All of the imprinted
genes show this.

00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:17.140
Amazingly, people now have
even identified imprinted genes

00:49:17.140 --> 00:49:20.470
that don't work
until after birth,

00:49:20.470 --> 00:49:22.800
and they work in the brain.

00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:24.410
And what do they do?

00:49:24.410 --> 00:49:28.390
The male-derived one does
things like make for infants

00:49:28.390 --> 00:49:30.230
that suckle more.

00:49:30.230 --> 00:49:32.820
Ooh, get more
calories out of mom.

00:49:32.820 --> 00:49:34.750
And the female
version tends to blunt

00:49:34.750 --> 00:49:36.310
some of the suckling reflexes.

00:49:36.310 --> 00:49:39.950
It's all built around the
strategy of males and females

00:49:39.950 --> 00:49:43.180
do not necessarily have
exactly overlapping

00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:45.510
reproductive strategies.

00:49:45.510 --> 00:49:47.210
So another version
of it is one--

00:49:47.210 --> 00:49:50.550
a male gene which is
pushing towards expression

00:49:50.550 --> 00:49:54.610
of the fetal enzyme fetal
lactogen, placental lactogen.

00:49:54.610 --> 00:49:57.500
And what that does is it
makes it easier for the fetus

00:49:57.500 --> 00:50:00.510
to grab sugar out of the
bloodstream from the mother,

00:50:00.510 --> 00:50:02.430
and the mother
tries to counter it.

00:50:02.430 --> 00:50:04.680
And if she's not very
effective at doing it,

00:50:04.680 --> 00:50:06.450
or if she's rather
over-effective,

00:50:06.450 --> 00:50:11.010
you get pregnancy hypoglycemia,
pregnancy diabetes.

00:50:11.010 --> 00:50:15.190
Suddenly, this is mom having
a fight with her offspring

00:50:15.190 --> 00:50:17.610
over how much calories
they're going to get,

00:50:17.610 --> 00:50:21.990
the offspring being driven by an
imprinted gene from the father.

00:50:21.990 --> 00:50:24.320
Totally cool,
totally interesting.

00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:27.190
There should be a problem
lurking here, though,

00:50:27.190 --> 00:50:33.560
which is this is a pattern you
only see in tournament species.

00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:36.240
You got a pair-bonding
species, and there's

00:50:36.240 --> 00:50:39.300
no reason why a male should be
saying something like, ooh, I

00:50:39.300 --> 00:50:42.210
want to like ruin her
future reproductive success

00:50:42.210 --> 00:50:44.240
at the cost of her giving birth.

00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:47.045
I'm a pair-bonding
vole, and I want

00:50:47.045 --> 00:50:49.270
her to give birth to a child
the size of an elephant

00:50:49.270 --> 00:50:51.820
who's going to survive, and
who cares about her future?

00:50:51.820 --> 00:50:53.070
They're pair bonding.

00:50:53.070 --> 00:50:55.270
They're in it together
for the rest of time.

00:50:55.270 --> 00:50:59.480
You don't find imprinted
genes in pair-bonding species.

00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:02.650
You find imprinted genes
in tournament species.

00:51:02.650 --> 00:51:04.680
And thus, we get back
to that same issue

00:51:04.680 --> 00:51:07.740
the other day looking at
tournament versus pair.

00:51:07.740 --> 00:51:09.940
Where do humans fall into this?

00:51:09.940 --> 00:51:12.770
And what we've already seen
is, if humans can come up

00:51:12.770 --> 00:51:15.840
with choriocarcinomas
and things like that,

00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:17.820
we have imprinted genes.

00:51:17.820 --> 00:51:20.360
Same punchline again
as the other day--

00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:21.870
in terms of the
number of genes we

00:51:21.870 --> 00:51:25.370
have puts us somewhere
in between tournament

00:51:25.370 --> 00:51:27.120
and pair-bonding species.

00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:29.940
Again, we are terribly confused.

00:51:29.940 --> 00:51:30.440
OK.

00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:32.510
Let's take a five-minute
break, and we will pick up

00:51:32.510 --> 00:51:33.323
with more examples.

00:51:39.521 --> 00:51:40.020
OK.

00:51:43.510 --> 00:51:45.520
Let's get going again.

00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:46.900
Two good questions just now.

00:51:46.900 --> 00:51:50.740
One is, where does homosexuality
fit into all of this?

00:51:50.740 --> 00:51:52.940
And where it fits in
is about 30 minutes

00:51:52.940 --> 00:51:56.160
worth of the sexual behavior
lecture sometime in mid-May.

00:51:56.160 --> 00:51:59.120
It is a challenge for
some of this thinking.

00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:02.020
The second good question was,
am I capable of speaking louder?

00:52:02.020 --> 00:52:03.060
I will try.

00:52:03.060 --> 00:52:04.610
I mumble.

00:52:04.610 --> 00:52:05.210
OK.

00:52:05.210 --> 00:52:06.060
Pushing on.

00:52:06.060 --> 00:52:10.060
So we've just brought in this
whole bizarre, unexpected world

00:52:10.060 --> 00:52:14.570
of trashing the Hallmark cards
of intersexual competition.

00:52:14.570 --> 00:52:17.850
Another example of it, a
really interesting one.

00:52:17.850 --> 00:52:19.230
This was work done
by a guy named

00:52:19.230 --> 00:52:22.320
William Rice at Santa Cruz
over some years looking

00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:25.110
at a number of
different fly species.

00:52:25.110 --> 00:52:28.050
Female flies are polyandrous.

00:52:28.050 --> 00:52:30.040
They mate with a lot
of different males.

00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:31.080
And you're a male.

00:52:31.080 --> 00:52:32.480
You've just mated with a female.

00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:34.730
And what you would
like more than anything

00:52:34.730 --> 00:52:37.260
in order to pass on
copies of your own genes

00:52:37.260 --> 00:52:40.520
is, like, not have some
other guy impregnate

00:52:40.520 --> 00:52:44.170
her, some other male fly
guy who's intimidating you.

00:52:44.170 --> 00:52:45.620
Not have some other guy do it.

00:52:45.620 --> 00:52:48.730
And suddenly, what you see is
this interesting world where,

00:52:48.730 --> 00:52:51.260
because of the mating
frequency of the females,

00:52:51.260 --> 00:52:54.470
she will have sperm from a
number of different males

00:52:54.470 --> 00:52:56.950
inside her at the same time.

00:52:56.950 --> 00:53:01.170
And suddenly, we get this very
strange world, a whole field

00:53:01.170 --> 00:53:05.210
of research, of sperm
competition-- sperm

00:53:05.210 --> 00:53:07.950
competition of
[? regal A teams, ?]

00:53:07.950 --> 00:53:10.750
and gold medals and
all of that, of sperm

00:53:10.750 --> 00:53:13.580
competing with the
sperm from other males.

00:53:13.580 --> 00:53:18.090
And what you see is, in fly
species, the sperm of males

00:53:18.090 --> 00:53:22.670
make toxins that kill
the sperm of other males.

00:53:22.670 --> 00:53:23.810
Whoa.

00:53:23.810 --> 00:53:25.170
That's very elegant.

00:53:25.170 --> 00:53:27.000
That's very elegant
because it, in part,

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:29.170
requires you to come
up with a toxin that

00:53:29.170 --> 00:53:30.980
isn't toxic to yourself.

00:53:30.980 --> 00:53:31.910
You can solve that.

00:53:31.910 --> 00:53:34.090
All sorts of molecular
tricks for doing that.

00:53:34.090 --> 00:53:35.980
But this makes wonderful sense.

00:53:35.980 --> 00:53:38.720
You increase the likelihood
of you, the sperm,

00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:40.440
reaching the goal
line and killing

00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:41.820
the other guys and all of that.

00:53:41.820 --> 00:53:44.410
Except there is a
problem for the females,

00:53:44.410 --> 00:53:46.940
which is these toxins
that the male sperm

00:53:46.940 --> 00:53:50.860
release aren't such a hot
deal for the female's health.

00:53:50.860 --> 00:53:54.690
And what Rice did with these
really interesting studies--

00:53:54.690 --> 00:53:56.750
I won't go into the details
of it, in large part

00:53:56.750 --> 00:53:58.940
because I still don't
understand what the guy did.

00:53:58.940 --> 00:54:01.750
But he was able to
somehow take populations

00:54:01.750 --> 00:54:05.680
of male and female flies,
and he would hold the females

00:54:05.680 --> 00:54:08.710
so that they could not evolve
in response to whatever

00:54:08.710 --> 00:54:11.450
was going on with the
males-- male-male competition

00:54:11.450 --> 00:54:14.670
for reproduction-- while he
held constant the female-female

00:54:14.670 --> 00:54:15.490
competition.

00:54:15.490 --> 00:54:17.050
The females were not evolving.

00:54:17.050 --> 00:54:18.175
The males were.

00:54:18.175 --> 00:54:21.360
And what he saw over the
course of 30 generations

00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:23.760
was this male-male
sperm competition

00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:26.100
was such that the
male sperm were making

00:54:26.100 --> 00:54:29.490
such powerful toxins that
they were shortening the life

00:54:29.490 --> 00:54:31.930
expectancies of the females.

00:54:31.930 --> 00:54:32.630
Whoa.

00:54:32.630 --> 00:54:33.501
That's not smart.

00:54:33.501 --> 00:54:34.000
Whoa.

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:35.360
That makes perfect sense.

00:54:35.360 --> 00:54:38.120
House flies are not
your pair-bonding swans

00:54:38.120 --> 00:54:40.990
dying in each other's arms
for life sort of organisms.

00:54:40.990 --> 00:54:43.640
It's a classic case
of the male only has

00:54:43.640 --> 00:54:45.910
an investment in the
current reproductive bout.

00:54:45.910 --> 00:54:48.690
And if he can wipe out
the competitor's sperm

00:54:48.690 --> 00:54:50.500
and, oh, bummer,
the female has now

00:54:50.500 --> 00:54:53.910
got all sorts of rotty
necrotic lesions in her vagina,

00:54:53.910 --> 00:54:56.610
this is not a very
reproductively effective female

00:54:56.610 --> 00:54:57.710
fly down the line.

00:54:57.710 --> 00:54:58.650
What do I care?

00:54:58.650 --> 00:55:01.410
I'm off to the next pile
of cow dung after that.

00:55:01.410 --> 00:55:03.430
You have that same
structure there,

00:55:03.430 --> 00:55:05.900
but this is a bummer
for the females.

00:55:05.900 --> 00:55:08.420
The males, left to
their own competition,

00:55:08.420 --> 00:55:11.410
will evolve more and
more toxic sperm,

00:55:11.410 --> 00:55:13.480
which exacts more
and more of a price

00:55:13.480 --> 00:55:16.520
on the future reproductive
success of the females.

00:55:16.520 --> 00:55:18.760
Now Rice flips things.

00:55:18.760 --> 00:55:20.600
And now he takes
these populations,

00:55:20.600 --> 00:55:23.030
and he holds the male
evolution constant

00:55:23.030 --> 00:55:24.970
and allows the
females to evolve.

00:55:24.970 --> 00:55:27.930
And over the course
of 30 generations,

00:55:27.930 --> 00:55:32.190
they have evolved a means
of detoxifying the sperm.

00:55:32.190 --> 00:55:35.630
So here we have male-male
competition inadvertently being

00:55:35.630 --> 00:55:37.910
played out in an
intersexual realm

00:55:37.910 --> 00:55:41.950
as well, where, again, this
co-evolutionary arms race--

00:55:41.950 --> 00:55:43.020
totally bizarre.

00:55:43.020 --> 00:55:46.530
Sperm killing each other, and
sperm damaging the female.

00:55:46.530 --> 00:55:50.170
And that makes no sense if you
do for the good of the species.

00:55:50.170 --> 00:55:54.810
Again, very logical in the
context of these models, these

00:55:54.810 --> 00:55:56.310
models of evolution.

00:55:56.310 --> 00:55:58.160
OK, final example.

00:55:58.160 --> 00:56:01.870
And here's one that will become
very relevant way down the line

00:56:01.870 --> 00:56:04.640
when we're are looking at things
like the biology of aggression.

00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:06.700
So you've got these
social primates.

00:56:06.700 --> 00:56:08.480
And in lots of social
mammals, you've

00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:11.940
got this pattern, which is one
of the genders picks up around

00:56:11.940 --> 00:56:14.980
puberty and moves
to another group.

00:56:14.980 --> 00:56:18.400
It's to avoid inbreeding and
everybody having six fingers

00:56:18.400 --> 00:56:20.810
and tails, if you're a species
that doesn't have a tail,

00:56:20.810 --> 00:56:22.240
and is perfectly logical.

00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:24.970
And what you need is just
some sort of [? pattern-- ?]

00:56:24.970 --> 00:56:29.780
is that the females or the males
of the species which disperse?

00:56:29.780 --> 00:56:31.850
And no one among the
primates has ever

00:56:31.850 --> 00:56:34.960
found a good rule for
which primate species have

00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:40.310
female exogamy or male exogamy,
which gender leaves at puberty.

00:56:40.310 --> 00:56:42.540
But there's
variability in chimps.

00:56:42.540 --> 00:56:44.770
It's the females who
leave at puberty.

00:56:44.770 --> 00:56:47.300
In gorillas, it's the
females who leave at puberty.

00:56:47.300 --> 00:56:50.990
In baboons, macaques, a few
other Old World monkeys,

00:56:50.990 --> 00:56:54.330
it's the males who leave at
puberty, with a very critical

00:56:54.330 --> 00:56:55.820
implication.

00:56:55.820 --> 00:56:57.580
So you've got baboons.

00:56:57.580 --> 00:57:00.950
Baboons-- you've got the troop,
and you look at the adult males

00:57:00.950 --> 00:57:02.740
and adult females in there.

00:57:02.740 --> 00:57:05.920
The adult females
grew up in that group.

00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:08.560
The adult males grew
up someplace else

00:57:08.560 --> 00:57:11.290
and emigrated into
here at puberty.

00:57:11.290 --> 00:57:14.950
In other words, among the
adult females in this group,

00:57:14.950 --> 00:57:16.540
they're all relatives.

00:57:16.540 --> 00:57:19.530
Among the males,
there's no relatives.

00:57:19.530 --> 00:57:21.760
Meanwhile, next door
with the chimps,

00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:23.940
it's the females who
have left at puberty.

00:57:23.940 --> 00:57:26.060
You look at the mature
animals in the group,

00:57:26.060 --> 00:57:28.490
and it's the males who were
there with all the relatives

00:57:28.490 --> 00:57:30.010
who have been there
all their life,

00:57:30.010 --> 00:57:32.730
and the females who
have no relatives.

00:57:32.730 --> 00:57:34.780
So asking a question.

00:57:34.780 --> 00:57:38.610
Comparing baboons and chimps,
which of those species

00:57:38.610 --> 00:57:43.850
has higher levels of male-male
aggression within the group?

00:57:43.850 --> 00:57:44.850
[INAUDIBLE]

00:57:44.850 --> 00:57:48.490
Baboons, yeah, because
they're all brothers

00:57:48.490 --> 00:57:51.070
and brothers-at-arms in
the chimp group there.

00:57:51.070 --> 00:57:53.040
And none of the adult
males in baboon troops

00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:54.730
are typically related
to each other.

00:57:54.730 --> 00:57:59.270
Very high levels of intramale
aggression intragroup.

00:57:59.270 --> 00:58:01.790
So which species,
on a certain level,

00:58:01.790 --> 00:58:03.500
has put us to
shame when it comes

00:58:03.500 --> 00:58:07.630
to the invention of warfare,
of fighting between groups?

00:58:07.630 --> 00:58:10.150
Chimps, because
you've got bunches

00:58:10.150 --> 00:58:13.660
of males who cooperate
because they are relatives.

00:58:13.660 --> 00:58:15.390
And what you wind up
seeing with chimps--

00:58:15.390 --> 00:58:17.030
and we will eventually
get to this--

00:58:17.030 --> 00:58:20.650
is you see things that are now
termed "border patrols," where

00:58:20.650 --> 00:58:23.290
a bunch of males from
a group will patrol

00:58:23.290 --> 00:58:24.910
the edge of their territory.

00:58:24.910 --> 00:58:27.680
If they encounter a male
from the group over there,

00:58:27.680 --> 00:58:28.680
they will attack.

00:58:28.680 --> 00:58:31.840
They will kill him, as
documented by Jane Goodall.

00:58:31.840 --> 00:58:34.520
Taken to an extreme,
the males of one group

00:58:34.520 --> 00:58:37.370
will eradicate another group.

00:58:37.370 --> 00:58:40.370
And if the rule is, I
am killing this guy,

00:58:40.370 --> 00:58:42.332
we are killing this
guy, not because we

00:58:42.332 --> 00:58:44.290
don't like the look on
his face, but because he

00:58:44.290 --> 00:58:47.630
is a member of that group,
this is the United Nations

00:58:47.630 --> 00:58:49.440
definition of genocide.

00:58:49.440 --> 00:58:52.380
Chimps have not only come
up with organized warfare

00:58:52.380 --> 00:58:54.220
between groups,
they have come up

00:58:54.220 --> 00:58:55.980
with a chimp
version of genocide.

00:58:55.980 --> 00:58:57.870
What's the driving
force on that?

00:58:57.870 --> 00:59:02.210
One of the truly scary
things on this planet, which

00:59:02.210 --> 00:59:04.290
is when all the males
living next door

00:59:04.290 --> 00:59:06.240
are getting along
with each other.

00:59:06.240 --> 00:59:07.940
Because when they
do, they suddenly

00:59:07.940 --> 00:59:09.750
start looking over at this side.

00:59:09.750 --> 00:59:13.780
Organized males driven by
female exogamy in chimps

00:59:13.780 --> 00:59:16.300
is where the warfare
pattern comes from.

00:59:16.300 --> 00:59:18.590
And as you can
guess, when we get

00:59:18.590 --> 00:59:21.160
to thinking about the biology
of aggression with humans,

00:59:21.160 --> 00:59:24.450
we are suddenly in this
world of taking non-relatives

00:59:24.450 --> 00:59:26.810
who were military
recruits and convincing

00:59:26.810 --> 00:59:28.990
them to pseudo-kinship
themselves

00:59:28.990 --> 00:59:33.971
into being a band of brothers,
increasing the sense of kinship

00:59:33.971 --> 00:59:34.470
there.

00:59:34.470 --> 00:59:35.990
Chimps do this all on their own.

00:59:35.990 --> 00:59:39.330
So now making sense of
which primate species have

00:59:39.330 --> 00:59:41.030
high levels of
male-male aggression

00:59:41.030 --> 00:59:44.490
within group versus between
group, between group

00:59:44.490 --> 00:59:47.790
are ones where it's the
females who leave at puberty.

00:59:47.790 --> 00:59:49.490
All these guys
have been together

00:59:49.490 --> 00:59:52.320
since they were terrorizing
other kids in kindergarten.

00:59:52.320 --> 00:59:54.910
They're an organized
group against each other.

00:59:54.910 --> 00:59:58.390
You get intergroup organized
conflict in primates

00:59:58.390 --> 01:00:02.220
that have female exogamy,
females leaving at puberty.

01:00:02.220 --> 01:00:02.869
OK.

01:00:02.869 --> 01:00:05.160
So we've now worked our way
through a bunch of examples

01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:08.280
here and how to apply
individual selection,

01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:10.690
kin selection,
that sort of thing.

01:00:10.690 --> 01:00:13.960
A fourth branch has come into
the field in the last decade

01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:14.870
or so.

01:00:14.870 --> 01:00:18.370
And this is one that has had
a lot of controversy, in part

01:00:18.370 --> 01:00:21.470
because what it is built around
is mistaken by a lot of folks

01:00:21.470 --> 01:00:23.010
as being an outdated concept.

01:00:23.010 --> 01:00:25.530
But in part because what
it is actually implying

01:00:25.530 --> 01:00:27.680
is very controversial
in some realms.

01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:30.660
And this is this business
of group selection

01:00:30.660 --> 01:00:33.220
somehow sneaking
back in the back door

01:00:33.220 --> 01:00:36.189
there and becoming
relevant to the evolution

01:00:36.189 --> 01:00:36.980
of social behavior.

01:00:36.980 --> 01:00:37.810
Group selection.

01:00:37.810 --> 01:00:39.020
You remember Wednesday.

01:00:39.020 --> 01:00:42.530
All the wildebeests there,
and the elderly wildebeest

01:00:42.530 --> 01:00:45.970
pushes his way forward and
distributes his bank account

01:00:45.970 --> 01:00:48.840
and then leaps into the river
and the crocs and all of that.

01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:51.420
And that makes no sense at all
because animals don't behave

01:00:51.420 --> 01:00:52.586
for the good of the species.

01:00:52.586 --> 01:00:54.400
In individual selection,
he got pushed in.

01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:57.070
Nonetheless, a notion
of group selection

01:00:57.070 --> 01:01:00.860
has come back into thinking, but
it occurs only under a couple

01:01:00.860 --> 01:01:02.690
of specialized circumstances.

01:01:02.690 --> 01:01:06.040
The version that we just
trashed, which was the version

01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:07.040
Marlin-- OK.

01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:10.510
How many of you guys know
who Marlin Perkins was?

01:01:10.510 --> 01:01:11.840
It's come to that.

01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:12.740
Marlin Perkins.

01:01:12.740 --> 01:01:15.420
How many of you guys know
what-- does Mutual of Omaha,

01:01:15.420 --> 01:01:16.430
does that still exist?

01:01:16.430 --> 01:01:19.110
Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom?

01:01:19.110 --> 01:01:21.470
Is that still a
television program?

01:01:21.470 --> 01:01:21.970
Yes, no?

01:01:21.970 --> 01:01:24.403
When you were young
did that exist?

01:01:24.403 --> 01:01:24.902
Yeah.

01:01:24.902 --> 01:01:25.401
OK.

01:01:25.401 --> 01:01:28.140
Is it still sponsored
by Mutual of Omaha?

01:01:28.140 --> 01:01:29.330
They still do.

01:01:29.330 --> 01:01:31.560
That's great, OK,
because that one has been

01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:33.400
going for decades and decades.

01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:39.460
And they'd somehow always have
to segue to Mutual of Omaha

01:01:39.460 --> 01:01:41.780
in there doing the
commercials, building it

01:01:41.780 --> 01:01:45.980
like, just as rhinos will
mate on for hours on end,

01:01:45.980 --> 01:01:49.350
you want fire insurance for
your home or some such thing.

01:01:49.350 --> 01:01:51.540
But in its original
couple of decades,

01:01:51.540 --> 01:01:54.050
it was hosted by a guy
named Marlin Perkins,

01:01:54.050 --> 01:01:56.800
and Marlin Perkins
taught most of America

01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:58.680
their evolutionary biology.

01:01:58.680 --> 01:02:01.270
Marlin Perkins is the
guy who taught everybody

01:02:01.270 --> 01:02:04.090
behaving for the good of the
species and that sort of thing.

01:02:04.090 --> 01:02:06.350
The first version of
group selection that got

01:02:06.350 --> 01:02:10.100
trashed in the '60s was Marlin
Perkins' group selection.

01:02:10.100 --> 01:02:13.190
The group selection that's
sneaking back into the field

01:02:13.190 --> 01:02:16.650
is very different, two
different versions.

01:02:16.650 --> 01:02:23.550
First one, something you will
get in various populations.

01:02:23.550 --> 01:02:26.040
You've got a population
of something or others,

01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:29.670
and some biogeographic
event occurs,

01:02:29.670 --> 01:02:32.680
which causes a subset
of them to get isolated

01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:33.710
from everybody else.

01:02:33.710 --> 01:02:38.390
A land bridge disappears,
or somebody drops a lake

01:02:38.390 --> 01:02:39.640
there, or who knows what.

01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:43.530
But something isolates a small
subset of the population.

01:02:43.530 --> 01:02:46.990
So these guys go about
reproducing by their standards,

01:02:46.990 --> 01:02:49.970
and these guys go about
reproducing by their standards.

01:02:49.970 --> 01:02:52.160
And what's going to be
a characteristic very

01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:54.790
soon of the smaller
population, they're

01:02:54.790 --> 01:02:58.830
going to be more inbred
than this population

01:02:58.830 --> 01:03:00.540
simply because they're smaller.

01:03:00.540 --> 01:03:03.500
They're going to have a
higher degree of relatedness

01:03:03.500 --> 01:03:05.810
among individuals.

01:03:05.810 --> 01:03:09.710
So now we throw our second piece
of our three building blocks,

01:03:09.710 --> 01:03:11.420
throw in kin selection.

01:03:11.420 --> 01:03:13.020
And what that
immediately predicts

01:03:13.020 --> 01:03:16.970
is levels of cooperation
will be higher in this group

01:03:16.970 --> 01:03:21.520
than in this group, because the
higher degree of relatedness.

01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:22.770
That's great.

01:03:22.770 --> 01:03:25.300
And that's great
because once we see

01:03:25.300 --> 01:03:28.990
how these sort of cooperative
systems have a larger payoff,

01:03:28.990 --> 01:03:31.710
you will get a crystallization
so that everybody,

01:03:31.710 --> 01:03:33.980
the second or third
cousins, are eventually

01:03:33.980 --> 01:03:36.650
going to have to be just as
cooperative as the siblings are

01:03:36.650 --> 01:03:37.660
with each other.

01:03:37.660 --> 01:03:41.370
You are going to fix
a trait of cooperation

01:03:41.370 --> 01:03:43.750
in that population
at a high rate.

01:03:43.750 --> 01:03:46.860
So notice here, in this
case, we have a high degree

01:03:46.860 --> 01:03:50.310
of cooperation driven
by kin selection,

01:03:50.310 --> 01:03:52.880
whereas these guys are going
about their usual "savage

01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:55.110
at each other's
throats" business.

01:03:55.110 --> 01:03:58.250
Biogeographic event
reverses, and these guys

01:03:58.250 --> 01:04:01.580
get reincorporated into
the main population.

01:04:01.580 --> 01:04:04.410
And they're so different
by then that they

01:04:04.410 --> 01:04:05.830
get a different color.

01:04:05.830 --> 01:04:09.950
And what you've got then is,
here in the large population,

01:04:09.950 --> 01:04:13.980
here is a nucleus of
animals who are cooperating,

01:04:13.980 --> 01:04:18.520
and here is the huge, unwashed
mass of the ones who are not.

01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:21.300
And everything we know
about reciprocal altruism,

01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:23.530
all of that, means
that these guys

01:04:23.530 --> 01:04:26.520
are going to start
out-competing these guys.

01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:29.710
And the model that is
used is cooperation

01:04:29.710 --> 01:04:32.100
will have to
crystallize outward.

01:04:32.100 --> 01:04:35.820
Animals will have to join in
in these cooperative patterns

01:04:35.820 --> 01:04:38.920
because these guys
will outcompete them.

01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:40.010
What do we have?

01:04:40.010 --> 01:04:42.150
This is called a founder effect.

01:04:42.150 --> 01:04:45.870
This is a small population
that, thanks to being inbred,

01:04:45.870 --> 01:04:48.920
has fixated some trait
that's advantageous.

01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:51.350
[? Where ?] the evolution
here moves faster than

01:04:51.350 --> 01:04:54.560
in here because of the smaller
population with the inbreeding,

01:04:54.560 --> 01:04:56.990
some adaptive trait
comes in there.

01:04:56.990 --> 01:04:59.450
They get re-induced into
the main population,

01:04:59.450 --> 01:05:02.280
and this founder-driven
trait quickly

01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:04.910
spreads throughout
the population.

01:05:04.910 --> 01:05:08.070
And what you get here is, if
the same thing is occurring

01:05:08.070 --> 01:05:11.160
in the realm of behavior,
reciprocal, cooperative

01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:14.240
behavior, somewhere in
here you have a transition

01:05:14.240 --> 01:05:17.450
from this being a kin
selection phenomenon

01:05:17.450 --> 01:05:20.900
to this being a reciprocal
altruism phenomenon.

01:05:20.900 --> 01:05:24.240
So that stands as one of
the models out there for,

01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:26.720
how do you jump
start cooperation

01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:29.120
in non-relative populations?

01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:32.710
You use inbred founder
populations to drive it there.

01:05:32.710 --> 01:05:35.560
And just to have a metaphor,
all you need to do,

01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:39.930
think about in some city
there's some occupations,

01:05:39.930 --> 01:05:42.380
some mercantile something
or other, that there's

01:05:42.380 --> 01:05:45.000
a gazillion of them, and all
sorts of people work in that.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:46.880
And there's a subgroup
of people there

01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:49.540
who work in this
who are all related.

01:05:49.540 --> 01:05:52.170
And as a result, they
do something cooperative

01:05:52.170 --> 01:05:53.360
and kin selective.

01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:56.590
They make low-interest
loans to each other.

01:05:56.590 --> 01:06:00.020
And as a result, they're
more successful at business,

01:06:00.020 --> 01:06:02.050
and they get
incorporated into here.

01:06:02.050 --> 01:06:04.540
And what you then have
is this economic force

01:06:04.540 --> 01:06:06.900
that everybody
else has to join in

01:06:06.900 --> 01:06:10.320
to this cooperative business
of trusting each other,

01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:14.480
or low-interest loans, or
I trust you like a sibling.

01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:16.450
You don't have to pay
me in full next week.

01:06:16.450 --> 01:06:18.210
Used to be that only
siblings trusted

01:06:18.210 --> 01:06:19.470
each other like siblings.

01:06:19.470 --> 01:06:21.850
But a force there
for more cooperation,

01:06:21.850 --> 01:06:25.949
a driving force of inbred
kin selection initially.

01:06:25.949 --> 01:06:27.490
So that's one way
in which people are

01:06:27.490 --> 01:06:29.700
thinking about group selection.

01:06:29.700 --> 01:06:33.030
And here you now have
this group out-competing

01:06:33.030 --> 01:06:34.490
this because of this trait.

01:06:34.490 --> 01:06:37.370
And people actually use
terms like "crystallization."

01:06:37.370 --> 01:06:41.460
The trait of cooperation will
crystallize outward and fix

01:06:41.460 --> 01:06:43.210
in the whole population.

01:06:43.210 --> 01:06:45.000
So that's one version of it.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.440
And this is one, again,
we will come back to,

01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:50.780
this is one of the ways
to jumpstart cooperation

01:06:50.780 --> 01:06:54.077
in a world in which there
is no reciprocal altruism.

01:06:54.077 --> 01:06:55.660
Because you see the
problem with that.

01:06:55.660 --> 01:06:58.470
We all have learned
tit for tat is the best

01:06:58.470 --> 01:07:00.690
one, except
[? forgiving ?] tit for tat

01:07:00.690 --> 01:07:02.910
might be better, except
Pavlov might even be better.

01:07:02.910 --> 01:07:05.910
And all of those who built
around this one requirement,

01:07:05.910 --> 01:07:09.140
though, which is somebody
has to make the first move

01:07:09.140 --> 01:07:10.590
of being cooperative.

01:07:10.590 --> 01:07:12.700
That's got to
jumpstart the system.

01:07:12.700 --> 01:07:15.060
And what we all
know is, in a system

01:07:15.060 --> 01:07:17.470
that doesn't go along with
the rules of can't we all

01:07:17.470 --> 01:07:20.210
sing "Kumbaya," what
happens is the first one

01:07:20.210 --> 01:07:22.510
in the first round who does
something cooperative is

01:07:22.510 --> 01:07:24.890
some schmuck who's one
step behind everybody

01:07:24.890 --> 01:07:26.360
else for the rest of time.

01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:30.320
There's no way to get these
cooperative systems to evolve

01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:31.220
initially.

01:07:31.220 --> 01:07:32.760
We'll see there are ways.

01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:35.400
And this is one of those--
have it driven initially

01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:39.510
by kin selection, and then throw
it into the general population.

01:07:39.510 --> 01:07:42.440
So that's one version of where
group selection has crept back

01:07:42.440 --> 01:07:43.290
in.

01:07:43.290 --> 01:07:46.820
Another version is sort of the
more generalized form of it.

01:07:46.820 --> 01:07:49.380
And it could be illustrated--
OK, the following example.

01:07:49.380 --> 01:07:51.250
You've got chickens.

01:07:51.250 --> 01:07:54.260
You've got chickens
with an array of traits,

01:07:54.260 --> 01:07:56.800
and you can see there's
two types of chickens.

01:07:56.800 --> 01:08:01.570
One chicken is super aggressive
and beats on everybody else,

01:08:01.570 --> 01:08:04.060
and she lays lots of eggs.

01:08:04.060 --> 01:08:07.310
Another chicken-- far more
pacific and introspective

01:08:07.310 --> 01:08:10.930
and less aggressive
and has fewer eggs.

01:08:10.930 --> 01:08:14.500
So now you take any one of
the high-aggression females

01:08:14.500 --> 01:08:17.100
and one of the low-aggression
guys and put them together,

01:08:17.100 --> 01:08:19.750
and who's going to leave
more copies of her genes?

01:08:19.750 --> 01:08:22.819
The high-aggression female
laying lots of eggs.

01:08:22.819 --> 01:08:25.540
Now instead, you
have a whole group

01:08:25.540 --> 01:08:28.390
of the high-aggression
females and a whole group

01:08:28.390 --> 01:08:29.859
of the low-aggression females.

01:08:29.859 --> 01:08:32.370
What's going to happen in
the high-aggression females?

01:08:32.370 --> 01:08:35.350
They're all so aggressive that
they all injure each other.

01:08:35.350 --> 01:08:38.000
They all stress each other
into lower fertility rates,

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:38.660
all of that.

01:08:38.660 --> 01:08:42.010
And suddenly you have
this very important world

01:08:42.010 --> 01:08:48.760
in which A can dominate
B, but where groups of B

01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:52.520
dominate groups of A.
And it's in that realm

01:08:52.520 --> 01:08:55.790
that you suddenly get a push
towards group selection.

01:08:55.790 --> 01:09:00.189
When selection on that level--
a world of any individual being

01:09:00.189 --> 01:09:02.830
outcompeted because of a trait.

01:09:02.830 --> 01:09:07.100
But as a "collective"-- and
bringing in that word not

01:09:07.100 --> 01:09:10.090
randomly, as a collective
in the collectivist future

01:09:10.090 --> 01:09:13.380
of low-ranking chickens to
throw off their chains--

01:09:13.380 --> 01:09:16.350
once you have a group of them,
the same traits that could be

01:09:16.350 --> 01:09:20.170
disadvantageous on an
individual dyadic level,

01:09:20.170 --> 01:09:22.479
as a group outcompetes
the others.

01:09:22.479 --> 01:09:26.200
And when you do that, you've
suddenly got group selection

01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:29.880
in a classical form,
where these animals,

01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:32.080
because of their traits,
they are not behaving

01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:33.430
for the good of the group.

01:09:33.430 --> 01:09:35.760
But the very traits
that are disadvantageous

01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:38.847
individually are
advantageous as a group.

01:09:38.847 --> 01:09:40.680
And it's another way
of thinking about this.

01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:43.990
If you indiscriminately
make low-interest loans

01:09:43.990 --> 01:09:46.479
to everybody on earth,
you are very readily

01:09:46.479 --> 01:09:48.229
falling into this category.

01:09:48.229 --> 01:09:50.450
If you were part of
a group that makes

01:09:50.450 --> 01:09:52.540
low-interest loans
to each other,

01:09:52.540 --> 01:09:55.010
suddenly you
outcompete the other.

01:09:55.010 --> 01:09:56.255
A fascinating book.

01:09:56.255 --> 01:09:59.750
An evolutionary biologist
named David Sloan Wilson, who's

01:09:59.750 --> 01:10:02.510
been the main person pushing
for this idea for decades,

01:10:02.510 --> 01:10:05.740
has a very broad range of
intellectual interests,

01:10:05.740 --> 01:10:07.220
including religious history.

01:10:07.220 --> 01:10:09.430
And a number of years
ago, he published a book

01:10:09.430 --> 01:10:11.730
called Darwin's Cathedral.

01:10:11.730 --> 01:10:15.680
And he analyzed the birth
of clusters of new religions

01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:21.340
over time as examples of
founder effects and group

01:10:21.340 --> 01:10:23.040
selection-type properties.

01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:25.340
And he wound up,
in great detail,

01:10:25.340 --> 01:10:31.150
analyzing Calvin and the
starts of Calvinism and Calvin

01:10:31.150 --> 01:10:34.960
and his sidekick Hobbes in
Zurich in the 17th century,

01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:37.010
or whenever it was
that Calvinism started,

01:10:37.010 --> 01:10:39.850
of analyzing how there were all
sorts of these little religions

01:10:39.850 --> 01:10:42.570
popping up there in
these little city-states.

01:10:42.570 --> 01:10:45.350
And what it was about
Calvinism-- in I

01:10:45.350 --> 01:10:47.440
think it was Zurich--
that took off,

01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:51.390
where they established some
of these inbred cooperative

01:10:51.390 --> 01:10:53.620
patterns and then
beat the pants off

01:10:53.620 --> 01:10:55.150
of all the other city-states.

01:10:55.150 --> 01:10:57.880
And soon, all of central
Europe was Calvinist.

01:10:57.880 --> 01:11:00.440
Really interesting
book in that regard.

01:11:00.440 --> 01:11:01.020
OK.

01:11:01.020 --> 01:11:05.140
So back has come this whole
possibility of group selection.

01:11:05.140 --> 01:11:07.610
And out of that has come the
more broad way of thinking

01:11:07.610 --> 01:11:11.440
about it now, which is
multi-level selection,

01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:15.720
a very important concept here,
which is sometimes selection

01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:18.912
occurs entirely on the
level of a single gene.

01:11:18.912 --> 01:11:22.840
In other words, have a gene
with bad enough of a mutation,

01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:25.250
and it doesn't matter how
many great other genes you got

01:11:25.250 --> 01:11:26.220
going for you.

01:11:26.220 --> 01:11:28.360
Selection will be
decided entirely

01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:30.930
on the basis of one gene.

01:11:30.930 --> 01:11:34.120
As we saw in our principles
from the other day, much more

01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:37.930
common-- selection at the
level of the individual,

01:11:37.930 --> 01:11:41.130
[? at ?] an aggregation of
the genotype playing out

01:11:41.130 --> 01:11:43.730
in terms of phenotype all
the different traits there.

01:11:43.730 --> 01:11:47.450
But what this introduces is some
circumstances where selection

01:11:47.450 --> 01:11:49.680
is at the group level.

01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:53.620
And it is never at the level of
how an individual's trait plays

01:11:53.620 --> 01:11:55.640
out individually in a group.

01:11:55.640 --> 01:11:58.280
It's how this trait
played out individually

01:11:58.280 --> 01:12:02.350
emerges as a group behavior
that you get group selection.

01:12:02.350 --> 01:12:05.020
And this marks this
great peace that's

01:12:05.020 --> 01:12:07.250
come between this
David Sloan Wilson

01:12:07.250 --> 01:12:09.670
and the guy who's probably
the most towering figure

01:12:09.670 --> 01:12:12.170
in this whole field,
this guy EO Wilson,

01:12:12.170 --> 01:12:15.210
Edward O. Wilson at Harvard.

01:12:15.210 --> 01:12:17.380
David Sloan Wilson and
EO Wilson spent years

01:12:17.380 --> 01:12:20.350
not getting along with each
other because Wilson-- Wilson--

01:12:20.350 --> 01:12:23.090
because EO Wilson
is very strongly

01:12:23.090 --> 01:12:25.270
individual
selectionist model guy,

01:12:25.270 --> 01:12:27.410
and thus he hated
group selection.

01:12:27.410 --> 01:12:29.300
David Sloan Wilson,
the other way around.

01:12:29.300 --> 01:12:31.140
Each of them were
endlessly invited

01:12:31.140 --> 01:12:34.910
to the wrong parties because
of the same shared last name

01:12:34.910 --> 01:12:36.850
and all sorts of social
awkwardness there.

01:12:36.850 --> 01:12:39.436
In the last few years, I
don't know what happened.

01:12:39.436 --> 01:12:41.060
I don't know if they
arranged marriages

01:12:41.060 --> 01:12:43.080
between their
grandchildren or something.

01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:45.210
But they arranged
some sort of truce.

01:12:45.210 --> 01:12:48.110
And Wilson-Wilson
published a paper last year

01:12:48.110 --> 01:12:50.561
basically saying,
whoa, you know what?

01:12:50.561 --> 01:12:53.060
Some of the time I'm right, and
some of the time he's right.

01:12:53.060 --> 01:12:55.101
And isn't that great, and
can't we all get along,

01:12:55.101 --> 01:12:59.070
and delineating circumstances
where individual selection--

01:12:59.070 --> 01:13:01.840
individual selection, kin
selection, reciprocal altruism

01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:03.760
is going to dominate
circumstances

01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:06.600
where selection is going to get
played out at the group level.

01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:07.840
They love each other now.

01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:09.300
They have formed a new language.

01:13:09.300 --> 01:13:11.020
They share burial customs.

01:13:11.020 --> 01:13:14.300
And this sort of constitutes
a great resolution.

01:13:14.300 --> 01:13:16.180
Yeah, depending on
the circumstances,

01:13:16.180 --> 01:13:18.190
the most important
thing in evolution

01:13:18.190 --> 01:13:22.940
might be a single gene, a single
organism, or a single group.

01:13:22.940 --> 01:13:26.730
And the power of a group
and aggregate traits that

01:13:26.730 --> 01:13:29.080
work lousy in the
individual is going

01:13:29.080 --> 01:13:31.080
to be really important
down the line

01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:34.410
when thinking about aggression
and stopping aggression

01:13:34.410 --> 01:13:35.840
and things of that sort.

01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:37.010
OK.

01:13:37.010 --> 01:13:38.250
So all of this is great.

01:13:38.250 --> 01:13:41.150
This multi-level
selection now showing

01:13:41.150 --> 01:13:43.330
sort of a fancier,
more sophisticated way

01:13:43.330 --> 01:13:46.220
of thinking about
individual, kin,

01:13:46.220 --> 01:13:48.490
reciprocal circumstances,
where it works,

01:13:48.490 --> 01:13:51.200
circumstances where this is
the most interesting thing.

01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:52.380
So that's great.

01:13:52.380 --> 01:13:55.420
So now we begin to look
for a first pass of where

01:13:55.420 --> 01:13:56.850
humans fit into this.

01:13:56.850 --> 01:14:00.520
We've already seen in terms of
all of these traits, tournament

01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:03.530
versus pair bonding, we're
somewhere in between.

01:14:03.530 --> 01:14:06.940
In terms of imprinted genes,
we're somewhere in between.

01:14:06.940 --> 01:14:08.140
These are specifics.

01:14:08.140 --> 01:14:10.830
How do we begin for
a first pass to think

01:14:10.830 --> 01:14:14.510
about humans, human behavior,
fitting into these frameworks?

01:14:14.510 --> 01:14:17.960
Two problems, or two
issues, that are all we'll

01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:19.060
touch on at this point.

01:14:19.060 --> 01:14:22.150
The first one is, there
is this temptation,

01:14:22.150 --> 01:14:26.070
as soon as you think along
these lines, to discover, oh,

01:14:26.070 --> 01:14:27.130
isn't that interesting?

01:14:27.130 --> 01:14:30.100
Langur monkeys will
have infanticide.

01:14:30.100 --> 01:14:32.720
Male langur monkeys will kill
the kids of some other male.

01:14:32.720 --> 01:14:35.030
Human males do that sometimes.

01:14:35.030 --> 01:14:39.130
Oh, langur monkeys might be an
interesting evolutionary model

01:14:39.130 --> 01:14:42.370
for where infanticidal
behavior came from in humans.

01:14:42.370 --> 01:14:44.580
Oh, isn't this interesting?

01:14:44.580 --> 01:14:46.929
Dominance is passed
along by males.

01:14:46.929 --> 01:14:48.970
We do that [? sometimes. ?]
isn't it interesting?

01:14:48.970 --> 01:14:50.310
Kidnapping somehow occurs.

01:14:50.310 --> 01:14:52.900
And before you know it, you
have a world in which people

01:14:52.900 --> 01:14:56.720
are saying, well, damselflies do
something that look like rape.

01:14:56.720 --> 01:15:00.290
So huh, we've got a damselfly
model of human behavior

01:15:00.290 --> 01:15:01.150
in that realm.

01:15:01.150 --> 01:15:02.790
And two things are
happening there.

01:15:02.790 --> 01:15:06.140
One is taking the traits,
a small number of traits,

01:15:06.140 --> 01:15:09.280
in some other species and
inflating the relevance it has

01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:10.510
for understanding us.

01:15:10.510 --> 01:15:12.310
The other danger
is that somewhere,

01:15:12.310 --> 01:15:14.650
creeping below the
surface, is you see

01:15:14.650 --> 01:15:16.780
it happens in other species.

01:15:16.780 --> 01:15:18.580
It's kind of natural.

01:15:18.580 --> 01:15:20.020
It's kind of inevitable.

01:15:20.020 --> 01:15:22.730
This is a whole world in
which people have run off

01:15:22.730 --> 01:15:26.710
with how this applies to humans
in a completely distorted way.

01:15:26.710 --> 01:15:30.600
We are unique as a species,
as is every other species.

01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:31.570
We are unique.

01:15:31.570 --> 01:15:33.640
By applying the same
evolutionary rules

01:15:33.640 --> 01:15:36.830
that every other species has,
that's the commonality, not

01:15:36.830 --> 01:15:38.040
the outcome.

01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:39.930
The other challenge
is constantly

01:15:39.930 --> 01:15:43.040
going to be that you get all
these great predictive models,

01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:45.580
and then humans
go and screw it up

01:15:45.580 --> 01:15:48.540
by having quirks
and idiosyncrasies

01:15:48.540 --> 01:15:50.990
and personalities
and stuff like that.

01:15:50.990 --> 01:15:53.620
All I can say in that realm
is, back to Wednesday,

01:15:53.620 --> 01:15:55.900
if making sense of
which lions are going

01:15:55.900 --> 01:15:59.720
to go to the scary speaker
in the bushes there revolves,

01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:02.440
in some part, around
personalities, humans,

01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:05.890
by the time you get to us,
blindly assuming these models

01:16:05.890 --> 01:16:11.160
apply is going to be very shaky.

01:16:11.160 --> 01:16:11.690
OK.

01:16:11.690 --> 01:16:13.530
So just a first
pass at how one will

01:16:13.530 --> 01:16:15.420
have to be cautious
for the rest of course

01:16:15.420 --> 01:16:16.820
in applying all these models.

01:16:16.820 --> 01:16:20.230
Now, far more critically,
is looking at,

01:16:20.230 --> 01:16:22.650
what are the criticisms
that have been brought

01:16:22.650 --> 01:16:24.470
against this whole framework?

01:16:24.470 --> 01:16:27.010
This framework of
social behavior

01:16:27.010 --> 01:16:29.235
has evolved to maximize
the number of copies

01:16:29.235 --> 01:16:32.440
of genes driven by kin,
driven by reciprocal altruism.

01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:34.680
Group selection is a rare
trait, but when it does,

01:16:34.680 --> 01:16:35.850
it follows these properties.

01:16:35.850 --> 01:16:38.510
This is how you explain
all the behavior.

01:16:38.510 --> 01:16:41.020
Know these four or
five rules and not only

01:16:41.020 --> 01:16:43.500
can you look at two
skulls of different sizes,

01:16:43.500 --> 01:16:47.140
but you can explain all behavior
and all of human behavior,

01:16:47.140 --> 01:16:48.360
and it's all biology.

01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:50.920
And eventually,
as EO Wilson said

01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:53.500
in his landmark
book of his in 1975,

01:16:53.500 --> 01:16:57.200
Social Biology, eventually
all of the social sciences

01:16:57.200 --> 01:17:00.630
will be under the wing
of evolutionary biology.

01:17:00.630 --> 01:17:02.500
No surprise that social
scientists were not

01:17:02.500 --> 01:17:04.960
very pleased with that
proclamation at that point.

01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:06.840
But this was this
notion that this was

01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:08.920
going to explain everything.

01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:11.710
So what are the criticisms
that have been leveled

01:17:11.710 --> 01:17:12.960
at this style of thinking?

01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:15.760
And as we'll see, there
are a lot of them.

01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:17.880
All of the stuff we've
been thinking about,

01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:22.560
this basic notion of applying
the Darwinian rules as to why

01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:25.460
giraffe have to have hearts
of certain size to behavior,

01:17:25.460 --> 01:17:28.960
there's three features that
are coming through [INAUDIBLE].

01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:34.280
The first one is the notion
of heritability of traits.

01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:35.960
Because what we've
been discussing

01:17:35.960 --> 01:17:38.720
throughout the last
lecture or so is,

01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:42.430
there's heritability of the
tendency to kidnap infants

01:17:42.430 --> 01:17:44.070
at the right strategic time.

01:17:44.070 --> 01:17:46.900
There's heritability
of the tendency

01:17:46.900 --> 01:17:49.980
to decide that you like
males with big, fancy plumage

01:17:49.980 --> 01:17:51.610
and long canines.

01:17:51.610 --> 01:17:55.120
There's heritability to deciding
that your daughter should

01:17:55.120 --> 01:17:58.260
be highest ranking in
the troop [INAUDIBLE].

01:17:58.260 --> 01:17:59.250
Heritability.

01:17:59.250 --> 01:18:02.880
An assumption of heritable
behavioral traits

01:18:02.880 --> 01:18:06.170
runs through every single
one of these discussions.

01:18:06.170 --> 01:18:08.320
The next theme that runs
throughout all of them

01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:10.930
is the notion of adaptiveness.

01:18:10.930 --> 01:18:15.300
If some trait has emerged
out of the evolutionary murk,

01:18:15.300 --> 01:18:18.270
if some trait has
been selected for,

01:18:18.270 --> 01:18:21.800
selection implies
adaptiveness-- the notion

01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:25.290
that everything you see has an
adaptive explanation for why

01:18:25.290 --> 01:18:27.590
it's emerged evolutionarily.

01:18:27.590 --> 01:18:31.110
The third principle, which
is not explicitly stated

01:18:31.110 --> 01:18:33.900
in this field very often but
is implicit to everything

01:18:33.900 --> 01:18:37.780
about it, is these processes
of evolutionary change

01:18:37.780 --> 01:18:39.030
are gradual.

01:18:39.030 --> 01:18:42.240
At every generation, if by
getting into some better

01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:45.240
behavioral strategy for
playing prisoner's dilemma

01:18:45.240 --> 01:18:48.850
you leave 1% more copies of
your genes than everybody else,

01:18:48.850 --> 01:18:51.010
come back in 100
zillion generations

01:18:51.010 --> 01:18:52.870
and that trait will have spread.

01:18:52.870 --> 01:18:56.280
All of this is played out in
generation after generation

01:18:56.280 --> 01:18:58.720
so that evolutionary
change is occurring

01:18:58.720 --> 01:19:02.300
in gradual, incremental steps.

01:19:02.300 --> 01:19:05.200
So what do you do with
these three starting points?

01:19:05.200 --> 01:19:06.220
The first one.

01:19:06.220 --> 01:19:08.390
An awful lot of
the next two weeks

01:19:08.390 --> 01:19:10.620
will be looking at how
other disciplines look

01:19:10.620 --> 01:19:12.690
at the issue of, how
do you figure out

01:19:12.690 --> 01:19:14.825
when a behavior is genetic?

01:19:14.825 --> 01:19:16.450
And one of the first
things we'll learn

01:19:16.450 --> 01:19:19.210
is how that phrase means
absolutely nothing whatsoever.

01:19:19.210 --> 01:19:21.580
Maybe a better way of
stating it is, how do you

01:19:21.580 --> 01:19:25.789
figure out when a behavioral
trait has a genetic influence?

01:19:25.789 --> 01:19:27.830
And as we'll see, even
the safer way of saying it

01:19:27.830 --> 01:19:29.830
is, how do you
figure out in which

01:19:29.830 --> 01:19:32.120
environment a
certain behavior has

01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:33.710
a particular genetic influence?

01:19:33.710 --> 01:19:37.420
How do other disciplines go
about saying, oh, it's genetic.

01:19:37.420 --> 01:19:38.420
It's genetic.

01:19:38.420 --> 01:19:41.530
In this field, among this sort
of sociobiological thinking,

01:19:41.530 --> 01:19:44.570
what you do is an
inverse style of proof.

01:19:44.570 --> 01:19:47.780
You say, OK, if a trait
has a genetic component,

01:19:47.780 --> 01:19:50.410
you would expect it to be
heritable along these lines.

01:19:50.410 --> 01:19:52.226
If it's more adaptive,
it will increase

01:19:52.226 --> 01:19:53.350
its frequency, all of that.

01:19:53.350 --> 01:19:57.150
And look, that explains where
competitive infanticide has

01:19:57.150 --> 01:19:57.830
come from.

01:19:57.830 --> 01:20:00.820
Show me a more
explanatory model.

01:20:00.820 --> 01:20:03.270
Show me a model that
is more predictive.

01:20:03.270 --> 01:20:05.180
And until you can
show me one, I'm

01:20:05.180 --> 01:20:07.300
assuming this trait
has some heritability.

01:20:07.300 --> 01:20:10.310
And we'll see how, by next
week, the more molecular people

01:20:10.310 --> 01:20:12.200
rip this view to shreds.

01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:14.970
Tell me, when you're
talking about heritability

01:20:14.970 --> 01:20:17.570
of some behavior,
show me the damn gene.

01:20:17.570 --> 01:20:19.690
Show me the sequence of DNA.

01:20:19.690 --> 01:20:22.080
Show me how that
produces the behavior.

01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:24.620
This is where this field
ends saying, oh, we

01:20:24.620 --> 01:20:28.480
can inferentially sort of decide
there's a genetic influence.

01:20:28.480 --> 01:20:31.270
As we'll see by next
week, this one piece

01:20:31.270 --> 01:20:34.770
is the main thing attacked
by a number of other fields.

01:20:34.770 --> 01:20:37.710
Next piece, the
adaptiveness-- the notion

01:20:37.710 --> 01:20:39.960
that everything
that has evolved has

01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:43.280
evolved under the scalpel
of evolutionary demand

01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:45.290
for optimization
and all of that.

01:20:45.290 --> 01:20:46.960
And the critics
of this view call

01:20:46.960 --> 01:20:50.580
this the adaptationist
fallacy-- the notion

01:20:50.580 --> 01:20:53.510
that everything is
there for a good reason.

01:20:53.510 --> 01:20:57.040
And what they often do in terms
of making fun of that is that,

01:20:57.040 --> 01:20:58.670
oh, you look at people
who do this kind

01:20:58.670 --> 01:21:01.650
of evolutionary biology with
this adaptationist emphasis,

01:21:01.650 --> 01:21:04.040
and it's one big just-so story.

01:21:04.040 --> 01:21:06.970
Why do giraffe have
hearts with thick muscles?

01:21:06.970 --> 01:21:09.980
And here's the story I make up,
and if my story is better than

01:21:09.980 --> 01:21:11.560
yours, I get tenure
and you don't.

01:21:11.560 --> 01:21:13.700
Why is that the
zebras got stripes?

01:21:13.700 --> 01:21:15.600
Why is it that
males kill infants

01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:17.040
in this species or whatever?

01:21:17.040 --> 01:21:18.710
That everything is adaptive.

01:21:18.710 --> 01:21:21.080
And what you need to do now
is come up with the story

01:21:21.080 --> 01:21:22.580
to explain why it's adaptive.

01:21:22.580 --> 01:21:25.040
And if it fits some of those
principles of individual

01:21:25.040 --> 01:21:27.190
and group, et
cetera, then you win.

01:21:27.190 --> 01:21:29.380
You've got the
best just-so story.

01:21:29.380 --> 01:21:33.050
And what is constantly
brought as a sort of criticism

01:21:33.050 --> 01:21:37.650
of that is, show me experimental
evidence that it is adaptive.

01:21:37.650 --> 01:21:39.110
And by the time
we get to looking

01:21:39.110 --> 01:21:41.400
at the field of ethology,
you'll see a whole way

01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:42.850
in which people do that.

01:21:42.850 --> 01:21:46.280
Show me that it's
possible to disprove it.

01:21:46.280 --> 01:21:50.340
OK, tell me a just-so story,
where if that were the case,

01:21:50.340 --> 01:21:52.810
that would prove that this
is not what's going on.

01:21:52.810 --> 01:21:54.460
You got to have the
rules of science.

01:21:54.460 --> 01:21:56.980
It can't just be you observe
something and come up

01:21:56.980 --> 01:21:58.790
with the best story and you win.

01:21:58.790 --> 01:22:01.920
But what's most striking in sort
of terms of criticizing this

01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:04.090
is some domains
in which there are

01:22:04.090 --> 01:22:07.900
traits that have not evolved
because they are adaptive.

01:22:07.900 --> 01:22:11.630
They've just evolved because
they are excess baggage.

01:22:11.630 --> 01:22:15.440
And this has brought in a whole
sort of criticism of the field.

01:22:15.440 --> 01:22:17.600
Now, some of the time, when
you begin to see-- it's

01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:20.530
kind of hard to see where
the adaptiveness is.

01:22:20.530 --> 01:22:23.370
It's because it's a more
subtle feature of it.

01:22:23.370 --> 01:22:26.060
For example, you
could look at squid.

01:22:26.060 --> 01:22:28.430
And someone who is
enamored with fish

01:22:28.430 --> 01:22:31.910
and how cool and aerodynamic,
aquadynamic, fish are

01:22:31.910 --> 01:22:33.660
and all of that, will
point out that squid

01:22:33.660 --> 01:22:36.860
are pretty lousy swimmers
compared to all sorts of fish.

01:22:36.860 --> 01:22:39.690
They're pretty lousy
swimmers compared to fish,

01:22:39.690 --> 01:22:41.750
but they're pretty great
swimmers for something

01:22:41.750 --> 01:22:45.250
starting out evolutionarily
as a mollusk.

01:22:45.250 --> 01:22:47.990
This adaptiveness has to be
in the context of where it

01:22:47.990 --> 01:22:49.880
came from and where it got to.

01:22:49.880 --> 01:22:51.740
OK, so that is a qualifier.

01:22:51.740 --> 01:22:54.250
Nonetheless, even
factoring that in,

01:22:54.250 --> 01:22:57.870
of hidden features of adaptation
in evolutionary history,

01:22:57.870 --> 01:23:00.690
there's lots of traits that
are simply not adaptive.

01:23:00.690 --> 01:23:02.850
And one of the most
effective critics

01:23:02.850 --> 01:23:05.260
of this whole view,
Stephen Jay Gould,

01:23:05.260 --> 01:23:09.300
introduced a term about 30 years
ago that summarized this view.

01:23:09.300 --> 01:23:12.540
Gould was a
paleontologist at Harvard,

01:23:12.540 --> 01:23:15.650
and his thinking will come
in a whole lot in next week's

01:23:15.650 --> 01:23:16.230
lectures.

01:23:16.230 --> 01:23:19.290
He teamed up with another guy, a
molecular geneticist at Harvard

01:23:19.290 --> 01:23:20.560
named Richard Lewontin.

01:23:20.560 --> 01:23:24.100
And in critiquing a lot of
this, they came up with a term

01:23:24.100 --> 01:23:27.090
saying an awful lot
of traits have evolved

01:23:27.090 --> 01:23:29.410
that exist not because
they're adaptive,

01:23:29.410 --> 01:23:32.690
but because they're spandrels.

01:23:32.690 --> 01:23:34.490
So at that point,
everybody in the field

01:23:34.490 --> 01:23:36.040
had to go run to
their dictionary

01:23:36.040 --> 01:23:39.010
because Gould and Lewontin were
all being snotty and coming up

01:23:39.010 --> 01:23:41.430
with fancy, highfalutin
culture terms,

01:23:41.430 --> 01:23:44.730
because it turns out "spandrel"
is a term from architecture.

01:23:44.730 --> 01:23:47.340
So immediately, they already
won points off of everyone else

01:23:47.340 --> 01:23:48.880
for being all
cultured and stuff.

01:23:48.880 --> 01:23:55.740
But a spandrel, a spandrel is
you got some medieval building.

01:23:55.740 --> 01:24:01.950
Remarkably enough, that's a
medieval building, and-- [SIGH]

01:24:01.950 --> 01:24:05.310
[LAUGHTER]

01:24:05.310 --> 01:24:06.765
--it's a nice medieval building.

01:24:06.765 --> 01:24:07.265
[LAUGHTER]

01:24:07.265 --> 01:24:11.960
And what you get is you have
these arches that-- there winds

01:24:11.960 --> 01:24:14.170
up being a space
between arches, that's

01:24:14.170 --> 01:24:16.419
there's space between
arches just because you

01:24:16.419 --> 01:24:17.960
can't build arches
next to each other

01:24:17.960 --> 01:24:19.820
without there being
like this space here.

01:24:19.820 --> 01:24:24.570
This is solid brick or
LEGO blocks or whatever.

01:24:24.570 --> 01:24:27.510
So you have these arches, and
there's a space in between.

01:24:27.510 --> 01:24:28.750
And you got this space.

01:24:28.750 --> 01:24:30.480
It's not there for
any good reason.

01:24:30.480 --> 01:24:33.600
It's there because you can't put
two arches next to each other

01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:36.070
without coming up with
this triangular space.

01:24:36.070 --> 01:24:38.510
And the architectural
term for those triangles

01:24:38.510 --> 01:24:40.650
are "spandrels."

01:24:40.650 --> 01:24:44.060
And spandrels, in
architecture, is something

01:24:44.060 --> 01:24:45.840
that forms between two arches.

01:24:45.840 --> 01:24:47.960
And as Gould and
Lewontin used the term,

01:24:47.960 --> 01:24:52.320
a spandrel is some
trait that occurs simply

01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:55.130
as the unavoidable outcome
of some other traits that

01:24:55.130 --> 01:24:56.490
are being selected for.

01:24:56.490 --> 01:24:58.550
You can't put two
arches together

01:24:58.550 --> 01:25:02.310
without getting some sort of
triangular shape in between.

01:25:02.310 --> 01:25:06.250
And throughout the history of
architects making spandrels,

01:25:06.250 --> 01:25:10.710
these would be artistically
built up and all of that,

01:25:10.710 --> 01:25:13.490
and there would be all sorts
of decorative stuff on that.

01:25:13.490 --> 01:25:16.980
So if you were an adaptationist
[? folly ?] person,

01:25:16.980 --> 01:25:19.670
everything has an adaptive
[? purpose. ?] You look at that

01:25:19.670 --> 01:25:23.270
and, oh, there's got to be
some reason why spandrels have

01:25:23.270 --> 01:25:26.520
evolved and have these elaborate
secondary sexual features

01:25:26.520 --> 01:25:31.010
on spandrels, little gossamer
things flying around and stuff.

01:25:31.010 --> 01:25:33.230
And there's got to be
an adapt-- oh, I know,

01:25:33.230 --> 01:25:36.030
because people in church will
look up at it a whole lot,

01:25:36.030 --> 01:25:37.310
and their necks will get sore.

01:25:37.310 --> 01:25:38.851
And when their necks
stop being sore,

01:25:38.851 --> 01:25:40.650
they will decide this
is the glory of God,

01:25:40.650 --> 01:25:42.730
and they will increase
their [? belief. ?]

01:25:42.730 --> 01:25:44.890
That's why architects
put in spandrels.

01:25:44.890 --> 01:25:47.180
No, you can't build
buildings like this

01:25:47.180 --> 01:25:48.936
without spandrels happening.

01:25:48.936 --> 01:25:50.310
And just because
they were there,

01:25:50.310 --> 01:25:52.190
why not let's decorate them.

01:25:52.190 --> 01:25:54.560
That's the evolution
of spandrels.

01:25:54.560 --> 01:25:56.680
And in Gould and
Lewontin's critique,

01:25:56.680 --> 01:26:00.060
an awful lot of stuff,
where the sociobiology types

01:26:00.060 --> 01:26:02.660
would sit there and say, we're
going to have a just-so story

01:26:02.660 --> 01:26:04.650
contest now and
use our principles

01:26:04.650 --> 01:26:07.515
and figure out some way in
which this is actually adaptive,

01:26:07.515 --> 01:26:09.390
they're saying, this
actually wasn't selected

01:26:09.390 --> 01:26:10.710
for because it's adaptive.

01:26:10.710 --> 01:26:14.510
It was an inadvertent
byproduct of something else.

01:26:14.510 --> 01:26:16.830
So here's an example
of that would be given.

01:26:16.830 --> 01:26:19.930
Humans have chins.

01:26:19.930 --> 01:26:21.000
Humans have chins.

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:22.700
Apparently, all
humans do have chins

01:26:22.700 --> 01:26:24.140
hidden away someplace or other.

01:26:24.140 --> 01:26:25.190
Humans have chins.

01:26:25.190 --> 01:26:28.440
And weirdly, we're like
the only primate that does.

01:26:28.440 --> 01:26:30.540
You look at, like,
other apes and stuff,

01:26:30.540 --> 01:26:32.240
and they have the
sort of weak chins

01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:36.660
that suggest sort of immoral
characters and criminality

01:26:36.660 --> 01:26:37.540
and things like that.

01:26:37.540 --> 01:26:40.010
We're the only species
that has chins.

01:26:40.010 --> 01:26:43.780
And apparently, there's been
some like nutty adaptationist

01:26:43.780 --> 01:26:45.780
school somewhere
back when, trying

01:26:45.780 --> 01:26:49.070
to make sense of why it is
that humans evolved chins.

01:26:49.070 --> 01:26:51.810
Why it is that human faces
come to a point there,

01:26:51.810 --> 01:26:53.590
and what's the
adaptive advantage?

01:26:53.590 --> 01:26:56.626
And [? where ?] you
can, like, stab rivals--

01:26:56.626 --> 01:26:57.300
[LAUGHTER]

01:26:57.300 --> 01:27:01.370
--or you can get crumbs from
out of the corner on the floor

01:27:01.370 --> 01:27:02.600
and stuff with your chin.

01:27:02.600 --> 01:27:04.400
Until somebody figured
out that there's

01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:06.470
no way that you could
have a primate face

01:27:06.470 --> 01:27:09.664
that has a muzzle foreshortened
and a jaw at this angle.

01:27:09.664 --> 01:27:11.330
You do this, and you
do this, and you're

01:27:11.330 --> 01:27:14.481
going to get this little
spandrel thing sticking out

01:27:14.481 --> 01:27:14.980
there.

01:27:14.980 --> 01:27:18.110
And oh, there hasn't
been selection for a chin

01:27:18.110 --> 01:27:20.970
because you have selection
for a hominid face

01:27:20.970 --> 01:27:23.890
with a shortened muzzle, and
this thing pops out there.

01:27:23.890 --> 01:27:26.260
And suddenly, all
those doctoral theses

01:27:26.260 --> 01:27:28.630
about the reproductive
advantages of chins

01:27:28.630 --> 01:27:29.990
go down the tubes there.

01:27:29.990 --> 01:27:32.250
It was merely a spandrel.

01:27:32.250 --> 01:27:33.910
And Gould and
Lewontin's argument

01:27:33.910 --> 01:27:36.750
is that there's lots
and lots of spandrels,

01:27:36.750 --> 01:27:39.050
that this emphasis--
everything is adaptive,

01:27:39.050 --> 01:27:41.030
everything is the
outcome of competition--

01:27:41.030 --> 01:27:43.480
that's produced that,
an awful lot of stuff

01:27:43.480 --> 01:27:46.790
is excess baggage that
merely gets carried along

01:27:46.790 --> 01:27:50.520
because the evolutionary process
isn't all that efficient.

01:27:50.520 --> 01:27:52.320
You're starting with
a mollusk if you

01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:54.260
want to make yourself a squid.

01:27:54.260 --> 01:27:57.420
Giving rise to another concept,
another term in the field.

01:27:57.420 --> 01:28:02.390
Andre Lwoff, who was a
French-- or was it Jacob?

01:28:02.390 --> 01:28:05.860
They were these two French
molecular biology guys,

01:28:05.860 --> 01:28:07.640
and they both got Nobel Prizes.

01:28:07.640 --> 01:28:09.890
And one of them said this,
and I don't remember which,

01:28:09.890 --> 01:28:11.770
but I'm going to
say it was Lwoff

01:28:11.770 --> 01:28:13.320
because I like saying Lwoff.

01:28:13.320 --> 01:28:17.290
Andre Lwoff once said that
"Evolution is not an inventor.

01:28:17.290 --> 01:28:19.150
Evolution is a tinkerer."

01:28:19.150 --> 01:28:21.380
It works with
preexisting structures.

01:28:21.380 --> 01:28:23.820
And the notion that you're
going to see this everywhere,

01:28:23.820 --> 01:28:25.630
you're gluing stuff together.

01:28:25.630 --> 01:28:27.960
You're duct taping
this part of the pelvis

01:28:27.960 --> 01:28:30.710
to this part of the
circulatory system, whatever.

01:28:30.710 --> 01:28:32.280
And you're going
to have spandrels.

01:28:32.280 --> 01:28:35.000
An awful lot of
what those folks go

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.910
through in these whole song
and dances of adaptation

01:28:37.910 --> 01:28:39.990
are merely spandrels.

01:28:39.990 --> 01:28:44.240
Evolution is not about
optimizing every single trait.

01:28:44.240 --> 01:28:47.840
What comes out of
that is this notion

01:28:47.840 --> 01:28:51.730
that an awful lot of
this world of competition

01:28:51.730 --> 01:28:53.120
really isn't about competition.

01:28:53.120 --> 01:28:54.830
You stick with these
models, the models

01:28:54.830 --> 01:28:56.740
we've been covering
for the last two days,

01:28:56.740 --> 01:28:59.502
and every bit of
advantage is going

01:28:59.502 --> 01:29:01.460
to increase the number
of copies of your genes.

01:29:01.460 --> 01:29:03.200
What's the only
possible outcome?

01:29:03.200 --> 01:29:04.220
You need to compete.

01:29:04.220 --> 01:29:05.440
You need to outcompete.

01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:07.820
It was a critique
of this whole view

01:29:07.820 --> 01:29:11.410
as being one driven very
strongly by competition,

01:29:11.410 --> 01:29:13.680
because all the traits
there are driven

01:29:13.680 --> 01:29:16.550
by having to out-reproduce
the next individual, next

01:29:16.550 --> 01:29:17.460
individual.

01:29:17.460 --> 01:29:20.390
Another realm in which
this has been critiqued

01:29:20.390 --> 01:29:23.850
has been by, interestingly,
evolutionary biologists

01:29:23.850 --> 01:29:25.830
from the Soviet Union.

01:29:25.830 --> 01:29:28.080
And where it was
emphasized there--

01:29:28.080 --> 01:29:31.010
in Western sort of emphasis
in evolutionary biology,

01:29:31.010 --> 01:29:33.330
most of evolutionary
selection was

01:29:33.330 --> 01:29:35.850
about competing with
other individuals.

01:29:35.850 --> 01:29:38.320
Sexual competition,
competing for running

01:29:38.320 --> 01:29:41.000
away from the predator faster
than the guy next to you,

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:42.849
competing for food, all of that.

01:29:42.849 --> 01:29:44.640
If you're sitting there
in the Soviet Union

01:29:44.640 --> 01:29:47.270
and you're thinking about
evolutionary biology, what

01:29:47.270 --> 01:29:49.270
you're mostly thinking
about is evolving

01:29:49.270 --> 01:29:53.540
the means of surviving climate
demands, surviving extremes

01:29:53.540 --> 01:29:57.030
of climate, what would
be categorized as abiotic

01:29:57.030 --> 01:30:00.830
rather than biotic, abiotic
demands in the environment.

01:30:00.830 --> 01:30:03.430
And when you look at species
where most of their survival

01:30:03.430 --> 01:30:06.410
is about surviving
ecological extremes,

01:30:06.410 --> 01:30:08.110
environmental
extremes, you don't

01:30:08.110 --> 01:30:09.690
see a whole lot of competition.

01:30:09.690 --> 01:30:11.410
That's a world with far less.

01:30:11.410 --> 01:30:15.160
And throughout the years, the
Soviet evolutionary biologists

01:30:15.160 --> 01:30:18.730
tended to emphasize
abiotic selection, which

01:30:18.730 --> 01:30:21.870
had far less of an
emphasis on competition.

01:30:21.870 --> 01:30:24.540
The final piece,
though, the gradualism.

01:30:24.540 --> 01:30:28.240
The gradualism is very
intrinsic to this.

01:30:28.240 --> 01:30:30.260
Because if everything
is adaptive,

01:30:30.260 --> 01:30:32.080
every little bit of
advantage is worth

01:30:32.080 --> 01:30:34.520
fighting for, and
competition and killing

01:30:34.520 --> 01:30:36.880
each other's infants and
killing each other's sperms

01:30:36.880 --> 01:30:38.279
and oviducts and all of that.

01:30:38.279 --> 01:30:39.820
And every little
bit is going to make

01:30:39.820 --> 01:30:41.490
for a little bit
of an advantage,

01:30:41.490 --> 01:30:45.010
and you will have this
gradualist change.

01:30:45.010 --> 01:30:47.450
And the huge challenge
that came to that

01:30:47.450 --> 01:30:51.020
was from Gould and another
scientist in the '80s, a notion

01:30:51.020 --> 01:30:53.600
that maybe that's not
what evolution looks like.

01:30:53.600 --> 01:30:56.960
Maybe evolution is not
occurring in these gradualist,

01:30:56.960 --> 01:30:58.360
incremental steps.

01:30:58.360 --> 01:31:01.780
Maybe what occurs instead
is long periods of nothing

01:31:01.780 --> 01:31:04.122
happening and then a
rapid evolutionary change.

01:31:04.122 --> 01:31:05.580
In long periods,
nothing happening,

01:31:05.580 --> 01:31:08.030
then rapid evolutionary
change, something

01:31:08.030 --> 01:31:11.110
that they called
punctuated equilibrium.

01:31:11.110 --> 01:31:14.480
And the whole next lecture
is going to be about this.

01:31:14.480 --> 01:31:17.450
Critical implications--
the genetics

01:31:17.450 --> 01:31:19.950
of how stuff evolves
turns out to fit

01:31:19.950 --> 01:31:22.780
far better the molecular
genetics with these models

01:31:22.780 --> 01:31:26.890
of punctuated, rapid
change, and stasis,

01:31:26.890 --> 01:31:30.220
equilibrium, punctuated change,
rather than these gradualist

01:31:30.220 --> 01:31:30.940
models.

01:31:30.940 --> 01:31:34.190
And if that's what it looks
like in these steps, most

01:31:34.190 --> 01:31:35.980
of the time you're
not punching it

01:31:35.980 --> 01:31:39.280
out for every one-half of
1% reproductive advantage,

01:31:39.280 --> 01:31:40.890
and it's all competition.

01:31:40.890 --> 01:31:43.240
Most of the time,
nothing's happening at all,

01:31:43.240 --> 01:31:47.270
and there's periods of severe
selection and then long periods

01:31:47.270 --> 01:31:48.600
in which nothing happens.

01:31:48.600 --> 01:31:52.150
A step function like that,
the role of competition

01:31:52.150 --> 01:31:55.050
is reduced tremendously in
thinking about evolution.

01:31:55.050 --> 01:31:56.820
So we're going to
spend a ton of time

01:31:56.820 --> 01:31:59.760
looking at the punctuated
equilibrium model.

01:31:59.760 --> 01:32:01.450
To give away the
punch line that I

01:32:01.450 --> 01:32:03.880
know you are all on the
edge of your seats for,

01:32:03.880 --> 01:32:06.970
I kind of think it's right
in a lot of the circumstances

01:32:06.970 --> 01:32:09.130
of evolution because
it fits much better

01:32:09.130 --> 01:32:10.940
with the molecular biology.

01:32:10.940 --> 01:32:15.920
Finally, in addition to these
critiques of show me the genes,

01:32:15.920 --> 01:32:18.110
everything doesn't
have to be adaptive

01:32:18.110 --> 01:32:20.490
because there are spandrels,
and besides, this is really

01:32:20.490 --> 01:32:23.050
wimpy science where science
counts as making of the best

01:32:23.050 --> 01:32:26.770
story, and there's no reason
to think that it's gradual,

01:32:26.770 --> 01:32:28.430
there's a mechanism
for this as well.

01:32:28.430 --> 01:32:30.070
In addition to
that, there's always

01:32:30.070 --> 01:32:33.800
been a final realm of criticism
of this style of thinking,

01:32:33.800 --> 01:32:36.310
which has been a
political critique.

01:32:36.310 --> 01:32:37.930
And in lots of
realms of science,

01:32:37.930 --> 01:32:40.630
you can't really imagine
a political critique

01:32:40.630 --> 01:32:45.310
as to whether cilia on amoeba
flip this way or that way

01:32:45.310 --> 01:32:48.220
or a critique as to
whether, like, plants

01:32:48.220 --> 01:32:52.320
should have three clover
things or four clover things,

01:32:52.320 --> 01:32:54.520
that there's not a
political factor in that.

01:32:54.520 --> 01:32:57.900
There's a huge amount of
sociopolitical implications

01:32:57.900 --> 01:33:00.060
that run through
this entire field.

01:33:00.060 --> 01:33:03.820
Because it addresses
issues of like how natural,

01:33:03.820 --> 01:33:08.400
how evolutionarily ancient,
how evolutionarily honed, how

01:33:08.400 --> 01:33:12.050
adaptive are things like
whether a species, a society,

01:33:12.050 --> 01:33:17.420
has male domination or not,
has strict hierarchies or not,

01:33:17.420 --> 01:33:19.270
has certain degrees
of aggression,

01:33:19.270 --> 01:33:21.780
has certain patterns
of sexual coercion.

01:33:21.780 --> 01:33:24.670
And a whole world arguing
that these things have

01:33:24.670 --> 01:33:28.870
a naturalistic grounding in
adaptation versus a whole world

01:33:28.870 --> 01:33:30.340
that says that's jibberish.

01:33:30.340 --> 01:33:32.140
Most of the time,
nothing's happening.

01:33:32.140 --> 01:33:34.270
And when it does, a
lot of it is spandrels.

01:33:34.270 --> 01:33:37.170
Those have very different
political implications.

01:33:37.170 --> 01:33:40.930
And from day one, the
critics of this entire world

01:33:40.930 --> 01:33:42.880
have made a point of
something that initially

01:33:42.880 --> 01:33:45.560
seems kind of silly,
but may not be silly,

01:33:45.560 --> 01:33:48.260
which is the entire
founding generation

01:33:48.260 --> 01:33:53.550
of these sociobiologists
were white, Southern males.

01:33:53.550 --> 01:33:54.830
Make of that what you will.

01:33:54.830 --> 01:33:58.830
EO Wilson from Alabama,
Robert Trivers, Irven DeVore,

01:33:58.830 --> 01:34:00.330
a whole population
of these folks,

01:34:00.330 --> 01:34:02.340
the first generation
of these people,

01:34:02.340 --> 01:34:06.160
were all white males
from the American South.

01:34:06.160 --> 01:34:08.650
Whereas Gould and Lewontin,
all of these guys,

01:34:08.650 --> 01:34:11.210
were Northeastern Marxists.

01:34:11.210 --> 01:34:11.920
OK.

01:34:11.920 --> 01:34:15.290
So we got kind of a
major contrast here.

01:34:15.290 --> 01:34:18.490
And the critique of the
sociobiological view is, well,

01:34:18.490 --> 01:34:23.780
isn't it interesting that their
notion of how evolution works

01:34:23.780 --> 01:34:27.730
just happens to emphasize the
naturalness of a system that

01:34:27.730 --> 01:34:30.200
rewards them for the
inequalities that we have?

01:34:30.200 --> 01:34:33.400
Isn't it interesting that their
models predict the naturalness

01:34:33.400 --> 01:34:35.840
of a world in which they're
the ones who benefit most

01:34:35.840 --> 01:34:37.580
from the notion that
this is natural?

01:34:37.580 --> 01:34:40.540
And from day one, that has
been a strong critique.

01:34:40.540 --> 01:34:44.440
And that's not like critiquing
cilia amoeba theories

01:34:44.440 --> 01:34:46.120
for political implications.

01:34:46.120 --> 01:34:47.720
That is a very real one.

01:34:47.720 --> 01:34:51.390
Because the notions that this
is pertinent to making sense of,

01:34:51.390 --> 01:34:54.830
is rape a human
psychopathology, or is

01:34:54.830 --> 01:34:57.590
rape a competitive
strategy, is the fact

01:34:57.590 --> 01:35:00.430
that children are more likely
to be killed by stepfathers

01:35:00.430 --> 01:35:02.230
than by biological fathers.

01:35:02.230 --> 01:35:05.270
Does that represent something
about the typical socioeconomic

01:35:05.270 --> 01:35:07.740
pressures in families
with step-parents

01:35:07.740 --> 01:35:11.250
versus the natural biology
of gene competition

01:35:11.250 --> 01:35:12.930
through competitive infanticide?

01:35:12.930 --> 01:35:14.920
This has a lot of implications.

01:35:14.920 --> 01:35:18.610
And from day one, as this
field emerged in the late '70s,

01:35:18.610 --> 01:35:20.780
there was a huge
political agenda

01:35:20.780 --> 01:35:22.320
that was assumed to be there.

01:35:22.320 --> 01:35:27.720
Sufficiently so at one lecture,
a famous conference in 1977

01:35:27.720 --> 01:35:31.060
where EO Wilson was presenting
there, a bunch of people

01:35:31.060 --> 01:35:33.160
rushed the stage and
knocked him off the stage

01:35:33.160 --> 01:35:35.470
and dumped water
on him and chanted,

01:35:35.470 --> 01:35:37.530
whatever it is in German,
saying, we will have

01:35:37.530 --> 01:35:39.860
a society of law and order.

01:35:39.860 --> 01:35:42.376
This is pretty
agitated circumstances

01:35:42.376 --> 01:35:43.500
for thinking about science.

01:35:43.500 --> 01:35:45.290
This was a group in
Boston called Science

01:35:45.290 --> 01:35:48.050
for the People, which was
a Marxist group at the time

01:35:48.050 --> 01:35:50.950
there, and saying, all
this sociobiological stuff

01:35:50.950 --> 01:35:55.070
is doing is justifying a world
in which it is male-dominated,

01:35:55.070 --> 01:35:58.720
stratified, and where aggression
and competition pays off.

01:35:58.720 --> 01:36:00.870
And this has been
highly controversial

01:36:00.870 --> 01:36:02.430
from the beginning.

01:36:02.430 --> 01:36:06.580
The one counter to it-- and I
think a lot of that was valid,

01:36:06.580 --> 01:36:08.630
and I think a lot of
it instead defaults

01:36:08.630 --> 01:36:11.710
into models where this is not
making a whole lot of sense.

01:36:11.710 --> 01:36:13.510
The one thing to
be pointed out is,

01:36:13.510 --> 01:36:16.750
when we see what punctuated
equilibrium is about,

01:36:16.750 --> 01:36:19.920
it's exactly the sort
of world of evolution

01:36:19.920 --> 01:36:22.970
that produces the sort of world
that a Gould or a Lewontin

01:36:22.970 --> 01:36:26.550
would want it to be, one
which minimizes competition

01:36:26.550 --> 01:36:30.710
in favor of cooperation and
a whole pattern of stasis

01:36:30.710 --> 01:36:33.110
and rapid dialectical change.

01:36:33.110 --> 01:36:36.040
It's exactly the world that
two Marxist geneticists would

01:36:36.040 --> 01:36:37.826
say evolution should be about.

01:36:37.826 --> 01:36:39.450
So I think that as
a first pass, you're

01:36:39.450 --> 01:36:44.120
seeing this stuff is dripping
in sociopolitical implications.

01:36:44.120 --> 01:36:47.700
So starting Monday, we will look
at this punctuated equilibrium,

01:36:47.700 --> 01:36:49.930
taking apart this
piece of the story.

01:36:49.930 --> 01:36:54.390
And basically, for the rest
of the course, examining--

01:36:54.390 --> 01:36:57.660

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.940
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:05.855
Stanford University.

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.040
So we pick up from
whatever the last day was.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.100
And we do our first
disciplinary leap

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.630
as promised at the very
beginning of the course.

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.890
The entire function of the
first half of the course

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.890
is to leap from one bucket
to another, such that

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.100
just as soon as you feel
like you are getting mildly

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.120
comfortable in one,
we will spend time

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.560
trashing it from the standpoint
of a different discipline.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.880
This is our first one of these.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.970
And the whole point of this jump
is to show on a certain level

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.310
exactly where one discipline's
the notion of an explanation

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.820
ends, another one begins.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.710
And what this one will be about
is how evolution works down

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.400
on a molecular level.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.340
Where did we leave off
after finishing our overview

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:56.960
of the evolution of behavior?

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.790
We finished with a bunch
of criticisms at the end.

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.490
Criticizing sort of what
some of the basic tenets

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:04.099
were of that view.

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:07.980
First off, that notion
of heritability.

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.970
Heritability-- assuming
that all sorts of behaviors

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.190
have a genetic component,
have a genetic basis,

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:15.520
have a genetic cause.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.100
And we will see those are worlds
of differences in those words

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.600
there.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.890
And what we saw was that
that could be the case.

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.050
That could not be the case.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.090
That's going to be what we
focus on a great deal today.

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.830
Another one of
the basic tenets--

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.190
this notion of adaptation.

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.690
Everything you see is
wonderfully adaptive.

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.330
The outcome is
exactly the process

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.290
that evolution brings
about to optimize results.

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.140
The counter view being the
world of spandrels-- a lot

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.040
of the time, stuff gets
carried along as baggage.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.900
Things evolving aren't
necessarily things

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.030
that have been sculpted into
being as adaptive as possible.

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.180
Another critique, and one
that's also central today,

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.810
is that whole emphasis
on the gradualism,

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.560
on small incremental changes.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.300
And what I alluded to
at the end the other day

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.139
is going to see
a viewpoint where

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:13.870
something very, very different
is proposed to be going on.

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.310
One that will make sense
only eventually when

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.930
we see some pretty unexpected
things about genetics

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.050
and the molecular biology of.

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.910
OK, so starting off--
what we also finished with

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.550
was a notion that there
are political agendas that

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.080
run through every
aspect of this subject.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.640
And if that very
first lecture, back

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.410
when talking about how some of
these viewpoints influence who

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.810
gets a lobotomy, who
winds up exterminated,

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.990
who winds up being viewed as
educatable or uneducatable,

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.070
et cetera, polypolitical views
run throughout all of this

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.600
you will see very
strongly in this realm.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.100
OK.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.870
So that viewpoint of
the sociobiologists,

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.130
the evolutionary
psychologists the other day,

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.430
one of the tenets going after
the notion of heritability.

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.790
The notion that these
behaviors are heritable,

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.610
or are genetically
influenced, blah, blah.

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.670
How would folks in
that business do it?

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.120
What they would do is
exactly what we were saying.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.020
Which is say, OK, here's
some behavioral structure.

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.410
And we know how evolution works,
and evolution of behavior,

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.530
and individual selection,
and kin selection,

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.310
and reciprocal
altruism, and evolution

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:26.390
of, and all the above.

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.310
And then they say, Well, with
that framework, that explains

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.750
the behavior pretty well.

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.520
Go show me something better.

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.090
Show me a better
theoretical structure

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.810
that's even more
explanatory, more predictive.

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.409
And until you come up
with something better,

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:44.200
I'm going to assume
that this one is right.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.930
And this one comes with
a larger assumption

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.990
of heritability of genetics
all built around inferentially.

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:54.140
These are highly
structured models

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.380
built around how genes work.

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.890
They explain what we see
with these behaviors.

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.500
And until you can give me a
model that does even a better

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.830
job, I'm sticking
with this, and this

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:07.350
counts as my evidence
for a genetic component

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.730
to this set of behaviors.

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.170
And what we'll see is
that's exactly where

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.110
the molecular biologists
decide that they finally

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:19.589
have gotten free of
people doing poetry

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:20.829
for all the science in it.

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:23.720
My god, that counts as science?

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.160
Coming up with a
bunch of these rules

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.140
there and saying until you come
up with fancier rules or a more

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.670
pleasing just so story, I win?

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:33.230
That counts as science?

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:35.610
Complete contempt
for this approach.

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.200
This is where more molecular
stance about it all takes off.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.600
And what we'll see
that that not only will

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.010
have lots to say
about adaptiveness,

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:48.310
it will also have lots
to say about gradualism.

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.160
So starting with it.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.700
In order to make sense of
this, for a molecular biologist

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.450
what is evolution about?

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:58.560
When you see traits that have
evolved, what's it about?

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.250
By necessity, what one is
immediately talking about

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:03.380
is genes.

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:06.560
Genes in this case
not as some constructs

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.340
that one wants to maximize
copies of and ones

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.570
that your cousins have
only whatever percentage

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:16.280
of in common with you, but
genes instead molecules.

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.230
Genes as information,
genes as strings of DNA.

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:24.080
And I'll assume by now there's
like a basic level of shared

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.650
knowledge about this after
hearing that a lot of folks

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:28.960
came to the catchup session
last week, which I think

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.310
is a good idea.

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:34.740
But what it's all built about,
all of this notion of genes,

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.350
eventually way out the
other end having something

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:41.500
to do with behavior, is the
intermediary of proteins.

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.390
Proteins are important.

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:45.090
Proteins are important
not just to have

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:49.510
in your diet to make you run
fast, and strong, and all.

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:53.950
Proteins are, in lots of ways,
the structurally most important

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:55.960
things you've got
making up cells.

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.720
Proteins have endless roles.

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.520
Proteins hold the shapes
of cells together.

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.380
Proteins form
messengers, hormones,

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:07.230
neurotransmitters,
all of this to come.

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:10.270
Proteins are the enzymes
that do all sorts

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:11.900
of the most important stuff.

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:13.940
Proteins, et cetera,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.260
Proteins are the
workhorses of what

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.730
have cells doing what
they're supposed to do.

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:21.930
So the question
of course becomes

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:23.850
what codes for proteins?

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:25.870
And this is where genes come in.

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:31.730
Our basic issue here is this
flow of information-- genes

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:34.250
specify proteins.

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:38.160
Proteins are made up of
constituent building blocks,

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:39.380
amino acids.

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:41.330
There's approximately
20 different ones

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:42.710
that are commonly occurring.

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:46.590
And each one has to be coded
for with a different DNA

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:50.300
sequence, a different
DNA sequence of three

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:53.070
letters, three nucleotides.

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:55.990
And I hope I'm not hitting
the level here where people

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:58.120
for whom this is new this
is going way too fast

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.470
and everybody else
this is way too boring.

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:03.790
But hang on for a
while in that case.

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:09.680
So DNA codes for amino acids.

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:13.290
A long string of DNA coding
for a sequence of them

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:16.080
will code for a
sequence of amino acids

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:20.060
which get plugged together,
and you then have a protein.

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:23.970
You've got one intervening
step, which for our purposes

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:26.190
is like not really interesting.

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:28.180
And we could ignore
it for the most part.

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:30.480
Which is, there's an
intermediary step--

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:34.300
genes at the level of
DNA, sequences of DNA,

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:38.530
first specify an
intermediate form called RNA.

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:41.620
And it's from that that
you get the readout forming

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:43.360
the proteins.

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.840
Now, everything about
the function of this

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:48.570
is built out of the
following sequence.

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:52.000
If you know the
sequence of DNA, you

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.250
will know the sequence of RNA.

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:56.970
You will know the
amino acid sequence.

00:07:56.970 --> 00:08:00.270
You will know the protein
that thus is made.

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:02.830
You will know the
shape of the protein.

00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:06.080
And you will then know the
function of the protein.

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:10.590
And that is this critical
link between what DNA, genes,

00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:12.640
evolution, blah,
blah, are about,

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:15.325
and the actual things that
pop out at the other end

00:08:15.325 --> 00:08:16.660
and do something.

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:19.330
For the very critical
reason that everything

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:23.130
about protein function
is built round shape.

00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:26.310
Here is a cliche that
is required by law

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:27.710
to be said at this point.

00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:30.540
Which is, all sorts
of effector proteins

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:33.250
fit into other molecules,
other effector proteins.

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:35.753
Like a-- OK, everybody
say it out loud.

00:08:35.753 --> 00:08:36.919
Everybody knows this cliche.

00:08:36.919 --> 00:08:38.120
It fits in like a--

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:39.370
Glove.

00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:39.940
Yes.

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:41.429
OK.

00:08:41.429 --> 00:08:43.320
Cliched education at its best.

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:45.100
Like a lock and key
for those of you

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:47.730
who are not tortured with
this one from early on.

00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:51.980
It's the whole notion that
a shape of a protein imparts

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:54.440
information insofar
as it interacts

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:58.140
with something else of a
shape which modifies it,

00:08:58.140 --> 00:08:59.880
which complements it, whatever.

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:04.000
The whole world that we will
have of various hormones

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.290
and neurotransmitters
will consist

00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:09.090
of hormones and
neurotransmitters going

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:12.680
into receptors where there
is a critical relationship

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:15.860
in the shape between the
messenger and the receptor.

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:19.040
And all of this is
driven by proteins,

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:20.700
protein shape, et cetera.

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:25.060
All of this is driven
thus by DNA sequences.

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:27.850
Shape is everything with this.

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:29.480
What you get from
that is, of course,

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:32.180
the question of where do you
get different shapes from?

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:35.670
And those 20 amino
acids, for our purposes,

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:37.120
for the purposes
especially people

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:39.060
without a strong
chemistry background,

00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:43.300
all that's pertinent here is
the 20 different amino acids

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:46.600
have different degrees
of being attracted to

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:49.030
or repelled by water.

00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:51.490
Which, most proteins are
spending their life swimming

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:52.490
around in water.

00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:54.110
They are pulled towards water.

00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:54.860
They avoid it.

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:56.790
They are hydrophilic,
hydrophobic.

00:09:56.790 --> 00:10:00.310
All that means is
different amino acids gets

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:04.160
pulled into different
positions by their relationship

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:04.670
with water.

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:06.930
And thus, a string
of amino acids,

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:08.980
the shape it winds
up getting with,

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:12.490
is determined by that
amino acid sequence.

00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:15.370
There is a whole world
of really interesting

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:17.490
horrible neurological
diseases called

00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:20.030
prion diseases which show
that everything I just said

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:20.530
is wrong.

00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:23.370
But for our purposes,
everything I just said is right.

00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:26.500
So this is where you get
this critical relationship.

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:28.260
Know the DNA sequence.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:29.850
Know the coding.

00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:33.880
And out the other end, you
will get protein shape because

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:36.290
of this business of
different amino acids

00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:38.260
having different
relationships with water

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:39.880
and thus strings
of them coming up

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:42.390
with different three
dimensional structures.

00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:45.550
And out of that will
be coming function out

00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:49.370
of the famed lock and key nature
between shapes of functions

00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:51.030
and shapes of other things.

00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:56.860
Just once again for people
fairly new at this-- nope.

00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:58.640
No diagram there.

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:04.217
One of the most interesting--
or the blank slate.

00:11:04.217 --> 00:11:06.300
One of the most interesting
things the proteins do

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:08.290
is when they are enzymes.

00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:11.120
Everybody knows that enzymes are
important because they put them

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:14.010
in your laundry
detergent, and advertise

00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:17.810
about how cool it is that you
have enzymes in your detergent.

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:23.190
But what enzymes do is
they catalyze reactions.

00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:26.810
They cause reactions to
occur which left on their own

00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:28.990
would be very, very rare events.

00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:32.800
What enzymes do is
accelerate vastly--

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:37.220
a gazillion times over-- the
speed with which these happen.

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:38.930
Catalyze reactions.

00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:40.490
What do I mean by that?

00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:43.180
For our purposes, they
can take two things

00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:45.860
that aren't connected
and stick them together.

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:48.870
Or they can take one
thing and break it apart.

00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:51.260
For our purposes,
that's what enzymes do.

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:54.980
Virtually every enzyme
out there is a protein.

00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:59.120
So proteins fit into other
things and send on messages.

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:00.500
Proteins are enzymes.

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:02.840
Pull things together,
pull them apart.

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:04.710
Proteins are structural.

00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:08.030
Again, a whole lot of the
superstructure of your cells

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:09.950
are held together by proteins.

00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:12.920
This is the realm
of what they do.

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:18.570
Notice here, suddenly there is
a change of shape in a protein

00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:19.960
if it's an enzyme.

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:20.960
Because what's it doing?

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:24.980
In some way, it's got to
be pulling apart something

00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:26.850
or putting something together.

00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:29.510
The shape, in some
cases, also can

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:32.080
change as a function
of what this protein is

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:33.290
doing with its job.

00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:37.310
We will see a classic
version of that are channels.

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:41.040
Channels in which chemicals
can flow in or out of cells.

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:43.080
Ions, for chemistry types.

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:46.330
Channels that will open up
under some circumstances,

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:47.660
close under others.

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:50.940
So protein structure not only
gives shape and function,

00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:55.080
but it gives the circumstances
where the shape might change

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:57.960
in a functionally relevant way.

00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:02.580
So out of all of this comes
of the central dogma of life.

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:06.530
And this was proposed by Francis
Crick of Watson and Crick fame.

00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:08.110
And Francis Crick
was the one who

00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:11.710
formalized saying the
central dogma of how

00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:17.390
life and information flows
is DNA to RNA to protein.

00:13:17.390 --> 00:13:19.120
And that became defining.

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:22.760
An entire generation of babies
were told that at birth.

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:24.350
This is the flow of information.

00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:26.350
It has been violated
in all sorts

00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:29.840
of interesting ways, which will
dominate a lot of what comes.

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:32.790
But this was the central dogma.

00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:34.940
One way in which
it is violated--

00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:37.740
and again, this notion
is not DNA to RNA,

00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:42.360
but the notion of whatever
your DNA sequence is, whatever

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:46.280
the gene is, whatever
structure of a protein

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:48.760
it codes for-- the
flow of information

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:52.450
is going to be from
DNA, RNA, to protein.

00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:54.730
DNA as running everything.

00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:58.330
Note the importance of that
in the very statement of this

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:01.690
as the central dogma, the
canonical flow of information

00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:02.220
in life.

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:04.520
It all starts with DNA.

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:08.870
DNA is the one sitting here
deciding when information is

00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:11.920
going to flow from DNA to RNA.

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:14.740
DNA as knowing what's happening.

00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:18.660
And a lot of what we will see
shortly is DNA knows squat.

00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:21.930
DNA is not making a whole
lot of decisions there.

00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:24.690
The one simplistic way in
which central dogma went down

00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:28.600
the tubes in the
1970s or so, and one

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:31.370
that's tangential here,
but just as a first blow

00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:33.010
against central dogma.

00:14:33.010 --> 00:14:34.510
One of the things
that's interesting

00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:37.000
is there are things
called viruses.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.130
And what viruses do for a
living is get into organisms.

00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:44.950
Viruses, in the classical
form, being little smidgens

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:50.710
of foreign DNA which are able
to get into the DNA of your own,

00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:53.790
hijack the processes
there, and make the cell

00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:57.050
function for its own
parasitic, vicious needs.

00:14:57.050 --> 00:15:01.090
And so you are changing
the starting step of how

00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:02.910
the central dogma of life.

00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:05.660
And thus you're going to change
RNA and protein, all of that.

00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:07.800
In the '70s, it
became apparent there

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:12.260
was one weirdo viral
world of viruses made out

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:15.870
of RNA, this intermediate form.

00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:19.140
All sorts of people were
extremely upset about this

00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:21.210
and tried to ostracize
the scientists who

00:15:21.210 --> 00:15:23.620
came up with this and
told them there's no way.

00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:26.510
But eventually, what
was shown in Nobel Prize

00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:30.650
winning glory was there's
a class of enzymes.

00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:32.070
Enzymes-- they pop up.

00:15:32.070 --> 00:15:35.610
A class of enzymes that could
take the RNA information

00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:39.140
and turn it back into
DNA, viral information.

00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:40.370
And then it does its thing.

00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:42.390
Huge blow to the central.

00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:47.960
Here's information running
from an RNA virus somehow being

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:50.780
reversed back to a DNA form.

00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:54.200
And thus these are
called retro viruses.

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:57.030
Inserting the DNA, and
off they go from there.

00:15:57.030 --> 00:15:58.330
So this was a major blow.

00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:00.330
Everybody eventually
came to terms with this.

00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:04.900
But it still is a minor
footnote in this Crickian world

00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:07.460
of everything flows from DNA.

00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:08.650
It is the Bible.

00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:09.870
It is the law giver.

00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:11.490
It is the holy grail.

00:16:11.490 --> 00:16:13.630
It is where it all starts.

00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:15.620
So stay tuned.

00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:18.530
So given that framework,
one should immediately

00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:22.030
get mighty impressed with
what if something changes

00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:23.050
in the DNA?

00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:27.550
What if one of the bits of
coding is coded incorrectly?

00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:31.240
What if we now have on
our hands a mutation?

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:35.220
And what we'll focus on
here is classical realms

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:38.460
of mutation, and
genetics, and how

00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:42.870
that plays out in
classical, gradualist models

00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:46.520
of evolutionary change, and
then see how all of that

00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:49.370
falls apart when you look
at what's really going on.

00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:51.457
So starting off,
what you can have--

00:16:51.457 --> 00:16:53.540
and again, this is going
to be a review for people

00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:55.170
with a background in this.

00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:58.220
Newcomers to this-- hopefully
this won't be going too fast.

00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:00.080
But broadly when
you were talking

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:03.290
about this world
of micromutations,

00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:06.569
for our purposes what we
will mean by a micromutation

00:17:06.569 --> 00:17:11.490
is when one letter in your
DNA sequence of information

00:17:11.490 --> 00:17:14.140
gets accidentally miscopied.

00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:17.420
Or it gets changed by radiation.

00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:20.880
Or it gets changed by
some chemical compound

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:21.650
the environment.

00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:24.349
Some such thing where
there's a mistake and one

00:17:24.349 --> 00:17:29.340
letter in the DNA
sequence comes up wrong.

00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:33.965
As I noted before,
pairs of triplets.

00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:41.550
And there we've got
three pairs of triplets.

00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:45.130
And what we've got here
is at the DNA level,

00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:50.830
a amino acid is coded
for by three base pairs.

00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:52.540
A triplet-- three of these.

00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:54.070
Next amino acid coded for.

00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:55.420
Next one coded for.

00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:59.060
So what we've just raised is
the possibility of a mutation

00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:03.480
occurring, something
changing in one single one,

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:05.310
and now asking what
are the consequences

00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:09.180
going to be in classical
realms of genetics

00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:10.870
and evolutionary change?

00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:13.060
Broadly, you can get
three different versions

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:14.670
of stuff going wrong.

00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:18.950
One is where one
of these letters--

00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:22.310
nucleotides, translating; not
essential to have that down--

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:24.300
where one of these
letters is accidentally

00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:30.090
changed into another
letter-- a point mutation.

00:18:30.090 --> 00:18:35.260
In some cases, point mutations
are of no consequence at all.

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:37.160
How can that be?

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:40.660
For this very simple reason,
going through some math here,

00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:43.050
there are four different
potential letters

00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:44.530
at each one of these sites.

00:18:44.530 --> 00:18:48.080
DNA comes in four different
letter types, letter flavors,

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:50.300
four different types of bases.

00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:52.480
And thus, you can have
four different ones

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:54.960
in the first
position times four,

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:59.780
times fourr-- a total of
64 possible three-step

00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:02.290
combinations of DNA letters.

00:19:02.290 --> 00:19:05.320
A possibility of 64
of them, and you're

00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:07.920
only coding for 20 amino acids.

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:11.200
So you use up some
of the 64 for signals

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:14.800
saying stop or start, or
thank god it's Friday,

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:16.130
or who knows what.

00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:19.440
But what you have, though,
is a large redundancy.

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:23.230
You have a number of
different triplet sequences

00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:26.250
coding for the same amino acid.

00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:29.670
There's redundancy
in the genetic code.

00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:32.610
And in general, where
you get that redundancy,

00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:36.880
where you get the differences
in three triplets, a couple

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:39.920
of different triplets that
code for the same amino acid,

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:43.250
they'll tend to differ in
the middle one of the three

00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:44.040
letters.

00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:47.350
That's the easiest one to have
a change where it doesn't change

00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:49.600
the overall consequence of it.

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:52.220
So you will tend
to have redundancy.

00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:57.010
Each amino acid is
coded for by a number

00:19:57.010 --> 00:19:59.500
of closely-related triplets.

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:04.190
So first possible type of
mutation-- this point mutation

00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:07.110
where one letter is
flipped to another.

00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:10.940
Potentially, this could be
of no consequence whatsoever.

00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:15.270
If you flipped to a letter
out of the middle one,

00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:17.550
which happens to leave you
with a triplet that codes

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:20.430
for the same amino acid.

00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:22.940
In that case, you have
a neutral mutation

00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:25.700
of zero consequence whatsoever.

00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:28.581
So that's not a very
exciting mutation.

00:20:28.581 --> 00:20:29.080
In

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:31.210
Some cases, you can
have a single point

00:20:31.210 --> 00:20:35.600
being changed where you wind
up with a different amino acid

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:36.600
coded for.

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:40.250
And that's most typically, if
it's a mutation in here or here

00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:42.040
rather than the
boring middle one,

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:43.870
you get a different amino acid.

00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:45.380
Is that the end of the world?

00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:48.720
Often not at all
or only minimally

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:52.560
because a lot of the amino
acids have similar feelings

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:55.560
and ambivalences about
water, similar responses

00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:56.830
and similar shapes.

00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:58.790
It won't be exactly
the same shape,

00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:01.460
but the protein will
function somewhat the same.

00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:04.330
So you could have, in this
case, a point mutation

00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:07.610
and most people would
not find the second line

00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:10.270
to be impossible to make
sense of in the context

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:12.170
of the first one.

00:21:12.170 --> 00:21:15.290
Or you could have a
point mutation which,

00:21:15.290 --> 00:21:18.220
by changing one letter,
produces a different amino acid,

00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:20.140
and this one is
majorly different.

00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:22.850
This one has a
completely different set

00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:24.930
of attractions or being
repelled by water.

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:29.220
Produces a protein of a very
different shape and potentially

00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:31.870
a very different message.

00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:35.240
And shown here, just changing
one letter in this case, one

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:37.310
single point mutation,
and you dramatically

00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:38.730
change the meaning of that.

00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:41.450
And I actually did that
once in the grant proposal.

00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:44.550
Sort of the final paragraph--
we have now accomplished

00:21:44.550 --> 00:21:47.340
x, y, and z with your money
over the last five years.

00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:49.400
And no wonder it
didn't get renewed.

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:52.230
So in that case, you see
a single point mutation

00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:53.700
of great consequence.

00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:55.930
So you can have one
of these letters,

00:21:55.930 --> 00:21:59.550
one of these nucleotide
mistaken for another-- entirely

00:21:59.550 --> 00:22:01.860
neutral, moderate
consequence, or

00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:04.030
major, disastrous consequence.

00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:06.860
Second way of
classical mutations,

00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:08.610
the second version
that it could come with

00:22:08.610 --> 00:22:10.740
is there is a deletion.

00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:14.330
One of the letters gets
lost in the process.

00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:18.850
And what you then get is a frame
shift over to the missing spot

00:22:18.850 --> 00:22:19.350
there.

00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:21.820
And the D from here
now finishes up this.

00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:23.440
And what you can
see is it suddenly

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:25.240
becomes dramatic jibberish.

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:27.120
And it would continue that way.

00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:30.880
A deletion mutation,
in classical genetics,

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:32.440
is major league.

00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:37.030
It totally changes the
coding downstream from that.

00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:40.910
Third classical type--
an insertion mutation.

00:22:40.910 --> 00:22:45.610
One where you now accidentally
double the letter,

00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:49.500
and you're frame shifted
in the opposite direction.

00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:51.860
Just as screwing up of meaning.

00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:53.750
Major consequences there.

00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:56.000
So you have point
mutations, which

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.920
can have major consequences,
or can have none whatsoever,

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:01.160
and anything in between.

00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:03.140
You have point
mutations, and then you

00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:04.570
have insertion and deletion.

00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:07.430
The last two tend to
have big consequences.

00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:13.320
So all of this is built around
one single base pair change.

00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:18.010
And all of this is built
around thus one single protein

00:23:18.010 --> 00:23:19.710
changing its shape.

00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:23.680
And thus, this world of
micromutation-- single spots

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:25.830
that are mutating--
what this tends to do,

00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:29.330
and this is an important
concept for what's to come,

00:23:29.330 --> 00:23:34.220
what it does is it changes how
well the protein does its job.

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:41.970
It changes the efficacy
of that protein

00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:43.740
by changing the
shape a little bit,

00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:45.890
by changing it
dramatically, all of that.

00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:51.210
And we can see back
to our lock and key

00:23:51.210 --> 00:23:54.020
where if, thanks
to a mutation, this

00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:58.400
has a slightly different shade,
it will fit into the lock

00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:00.020
slightly less effectively.

00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:02.560
It may stay in there
for a shorter time

00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:06.894
before floating off and
thus send less of a message.

00:24:06.894 --> 00:24:09.310
On the other hand, if you've
got a deletion insertion that

00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:11.350
dramatically changes
the shape of this,

00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:14.204
you will change how well
this protein does its job.

00:24:14.204 --> 00:24:15.870
It won't do its job
at all, because it's

00:24:15.870 --> 00:24:17.953
going to wind up with a
completely different shape

00:24:17.953 --> 00:24:19.370
and not fit in there whatsoever.

00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:22.200
What we have here is
a world of mutations

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:28.270
which are changing the function
of one protein at a time.

00:24:28.270 --> 00:24:31.840
That is
microevolutionary change,

00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:34.910
and that's what we're now
going to see played out.

00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:36.780
When can this make a difference?

00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:39.180
This can make huge
differences when

00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:42.080
it's in the realm where, thanks
to a change in the shape,

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:44.670
the protein is completely
out of business.

00:24:44.670 --> 00:24:47.670
Two examples-- one where
you take out the function

00:24:47.670 --> 00:24:49.390
of the preexisting gene.

00:24:49.390 --> 00:24:53.570
First one-- there
is this amino acid.

00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:56.050
For our purposes, that's
going to derail us.

00:24:56.050 --> 00:24:58.700
For our purposes,
there's a chemical

00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:02.260
that occurs in the body
called phenylalanine,

00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:03.840
which has its uses.

00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:05.650
But you don't want
the levels of it

00:25:05.650 --> 00:25:09.010
to build up too high, because
it can become toxic, damaging

00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:11.310
to brain cells, to neurons.

00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:15.270
And fortunately,
there is an enzyme

00:25:15.270 --> 00:25:18.840
made of protein which turns
phenylalanine into something

00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:19.530
safer.

00:25:19.530 --> 00:25:21.480
That's all we need
to know about it.

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:27.260
So you have a mutation in the
gene coding for that enzyme.

00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:29.590
Not a fancy mutation
to something.

00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:33.100
One of these categories--
a classical, single spot

00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:34.620
point mutation.

00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:37.480
And what you got there
is an enzyme that

00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:39.800
no longer does its job.

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:42.440
And as a result,
this phenylalanine

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:44.730
is not converted
into the safer form,

00:25:44.730 --> 00:25:47.970
builds up, and lays waste
to one's nervous system.

00:25:47.970 --> 00:25:52.330
And thus you have a disease--
PKU, phenylketonuria.

00:25:52.330 --> 00:25:55.340
Very, very common
genetic disorder.

00:25:55.340 --> 00:26:00.130
And this is one where the
outcome is a small mutation

00:26:00.130 --> 00:26:03.140
that has completely knocked
this enzyme out of business--

00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:05.330
this enzyme which
was able to turn

00:26:05.330 --> 00:26:08.130
the phenylalanine
into something safer.

00:26:08.130 --> 00:26:10.050
This is not a subtle outcome.

00:26:10.050 --> 00:26:14.120
Have untreated PKU, and
your reproductive success

00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:15.610
by the rules of
evolution is going

00:26:15.610 --> 00:26:17.510
to be real down near zero.

00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:21.420
This destroys the nervous
system very rapidly after birth.

00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:23.290
So that's dramatic.

00:26:23.290 --> 00:26:24.949
Here's another dramatic one.

00:26:24.949 --> 00:26:26.615
And this one-- anyone
who took BIO CORE,

00:26:26.615 --> 00:26:30.950
I always bring this one in as
a big hormone crowd pleaser.

00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:33.060
But here's an
interesting thing that

00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:37.160
can go wrong with any child
you might eventually have.

00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:40.940
You've got a daughter,
and she's doing just fine.

00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:44.130
And she's growing up just
fine, and things are terrific.

00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:49.330
And around age 10, or 11, or
so, some of her classmates

00:26:49.330 --> 00:26:51.190
are beginning to reach puberty.

00:26:51.190 --> 00:26:54.150
That's on the early side
for the Western average,

00:26:54.150 --> 00:26:55.640
but it's not outrageously early.

00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:56.640
Not a big deal.

00:26:56.640 --> 00:27:02.160
By about 12, statistically about
half of the girls in her class

00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:03.210
have reached puberty.

00:27:03.210 --> 00:27:05.800
12 is about the Westernized
average these days.

00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:06.730
She hasn't yet.

00:27:06.730 --> 00:27:07.820
Not a big deal.

00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:09.719
A year later, she still hasn't.

00:27:09.719 --> 00:27:12.260
Well, this is nothing critical,
but it's getting a little bit

00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:13.150
on the late side.

00:27:13.150 --> 00:27:15.500
A year after that, two
years after that, she

00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:17.550
has still not reached puberty.

00:27:17.550 --> 00:27:20.710
So at that point, you
take her to a physician

00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:25.000
who examines her closely
and figures out what's up.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.280
And at some point, the
physician is probably

00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:30.000
going to have pupils
dilate, or some sort

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.180
of weird autonomic response,
when they figure out what's up.

00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:37.010
And then very calmly,
in a premeditated way,

00:27:37.010 --> 00:27:39.060
sit you down for a
little talk afterward,

00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:41.290
and inform you that
your daughter has not

00:27:41.290 --> 00:27:43.604
started menstruating, has
not reached puberty yet.

00:27:43.604 --> 00:27:45.770
Your daughter has not started
to do this because you

00:27:45.770 --> 00:27:47.220
don't have a daughter.

00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:48.850
You've got a son.

00:27:48.850 --> 00:27:51.760
This kid here for
these last 14 years

00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:54.890
has actually been
male, not female.

00:27:54.890 --> 00:27:57.700
You have what is called-- no,
I'm not going to tell you it.

00:27:57.700 --> 00:28:00.720
OK, it's called-- especially
since it's in the handout

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:02.760
already-- anyone want to
guess what it's called?

00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:06.860
It's called TFM, Testicular
Feminization Syndrome.

00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:10.300
And you wind up with a
testicular feminized male.

00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:15.680
These are individuals who,
genetically, are male.

00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:19.710
At the level of chromosomes,
that XX and XY business,

00:28:19.710 --> 00:28:22.790
these are individuals
who have testes.

00:28:22.790 --> 00:28:26.420
Testes way up in their
stomach or whatever, never

00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:28.150
descended down.

00:28:28.150 --> 00:28:32.270
These are people whose
testes make testosterone.

00:28:32.270 --> 00:28:34.370
Testosterone out the wazoo.

00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:36.190
Tons of testosterone.

00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:39.500
Enough testosterone to put
like antlers on your testes,

00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:40.340
or something.

00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:41.810
That much testosterone.

00:28:41.810 --> 00:28:46.100
And nonetheless, you're
getting a female phenotype.

00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:49.180
You are getting a female
external genitalia.

00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:50.890
You are getting
female everything.

00:28:50.890 --> 00:28:51.810
Yup, question?

00:28:51.810 --> 00:28:55.240
Sorry, is that different
than androgyne insensitivity?

00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:57.430
No, that's the
fancy term for it.

00:28:57.430 --> 00:29:00.700
And you've just given away
the punchline, you creep.

00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:02.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:07.340
So they figured out in
this disease there's

00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:10.030
an insensitivity to something.

00:29:10.030 --> 00:29:11.490
What could that be?

00:29:11.490 --> 00:29:12.990
OK, go and say it again.

00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:14.780
Yes, OK.

00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:18.430
What you've got here is one of
those simple little classical

00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:19.510
mutations.

00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:23.040
And what it does is it changed
the shape of the androgen

00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:25.570
receptor, the
testosterone receptor.

00:29:25.570 --> 00:29:28.390
And at that point it doesn't
matter how much testosterone

00:29:28.390 --> 00:29:32.710
is floating around, those target
cells are not going to listen.

00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:34.700
This is consequential.

00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:36.690
This is a major consequence.

00:29:36.690 --> 00:29:39.270
This is one of changing
gender phenotype,

00:29:39.270 --> 00:29:42.760
and there is a long and at
times absolutely appalling

00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:46.200
history of what has been
done with individuals

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:49.620
who have Testicular
Feminization Syndrome, what

00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:52.890
counts as the medically
appropriate intervention.

00:29:52.890 --> 00:29:54.990
There's some horrifying
history there

00:29:54.990 --> 00:29:57.990
that could be straight out
of the first lecture in terms

00:29:57.990 --> 00:30:01.890
of some notions of what counts
as normal gender behavior.

00:30:01.890 --> 00:30:03.620
Another version of
this-- this one's

00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:05.830
a little bit more subtle
because in this case,

00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:08.780
it's not wiping out the
function of an enzyme.

00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:12.570
It's just making it a little bit
less effective at what it does.

00:30:12.570 --> 00:30:14.950
And this has to do
with a disease that

00:30:14.950 --> 00:30:18.380
is found in two different
populations, slight variants

00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:18.920
on it.

00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:22.090
One is up in the Dominican
Republic, in the mountains.

00:30:22.090 --> 00:30:24.440
The other is in the
mountains of New Guinea.

00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:26.930
Interesting similarity there.

00:30:26.930 --> 00:30:31.010
In both cases, some fairly
isolated, inbred populations.

00:30:31.010 --> 00:30:34.420
So that has genetics
written all over it.

00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:37.520
But in these cases, there
is a problem with enzymes

00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:40.690
that make testosterone.

00:30:40.690 --> 00:30:42.490
So this is a whole other world.

00:30:42.490 --> 00:30:46.270
Instead of the enzyme, instead
of the proteins, and thus

00:30:46.270 --> 00:30:48.700
the gene somewhere
back there, that code

00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:51.650
for the receptor
for testosterone,

00:30:51.650 --> 00:30:55.340
the receptor that responds
to this messenger,

00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:58.032
here instead it's back way
up there in the testes.

00:30:58.032 --> 00:31:00.490
A bunch of these enzymes, which
go through a bunch of steps

00:31:00.490 --> 00:31:04.910
and make testosterone,
biosynthetic enzymes there.

00:31:04.910 --> 00:31:06.600
Proteins, genes, once again.

00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:10.540
So you've got a mutation in one
of those critical, biosynthetic

00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:11.400
enzymes.

00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:14.050
And It's not a huge one.

00:31:14.050 --> 00:31:15.660
The shape is a little bit off.

00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:18.650
Its efficacy, the
effectiveness with which

00:31:18.650 --> 00:31:20.950
it makes testosterone
is down a bit--

00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:23.020
and actually it's
down a lot-- so here's

00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:24.840
what you wind up getting.

00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:29.180
You get an individual
who before puberty has

00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:32.070
extremely low
testosterone levels, even

00:31:32.070 --> 00:31:35.041
far lower than you would see
in prepubescent males in most

00:31:35.041 --> 00:31:35.540
cases.

00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:37.000
Someone who's genetically male.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.890
Someone who never saw a
whole lot of testosterone

00:31:39.890 --> 00:31:42.870
during fetal life, way
below the threshold

00:31:42.870 --> 00:31:46.140
for the testosterone
having any effects.

00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:49.420
So the person is born
phenotypically female.

00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:50.880
Female in appearance.

00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:53.540
Female in external genitalia.

00:31:53.540 --> 00:31:57.140
And not internal-- back to those
testicular feminized males.

00:31:57.140 --> 00:32:01.630
What you find there is a
vagina which goes nowhere,

00:32:01.630 --> 00:32:04.760
because there's no ovaries
waiting somewhere above that.

00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:05.760
There is the testes.

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:07.970
But the external
genitalia is just fine.

00:32:07.970 --> 00:32:12.230
What I think these days is
the most common medical ethics

00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:16.360
advice and what's done with that
is the physician explains what

00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:19.310
it is and says, For
all practical purposes,

00:32:19.310 --> 00:32:21.600
you have a daughter who
is perfectly healthy,

00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:23.830
who's going to have a
long, happy, healthy life,

00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:25.590
and simply cannot reproduce.

00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:28.460
That's the only consequence
that's relevant here.

00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:30.580
And there's been a
whole other world

00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:35.460
of reconstructive surgery, and
all sorts of very interesting,

00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:36.850
horrifying history.

00:32:36.850 --> 00:32:38.010
So back to this one.

00:32:38.010 --> 00:32:41.057
Because of the extremely
low testosterone levels,

00:32:41.057 --> 00:32:42.890
because at the time of
life when there's not

00:32:42.890 --> 00:32:45.410
a whole lot of testosterone
around in the fetus,

00:32:45.410 --> 00:32:48.715
in a young male, and now
it's below the threshold

00:32:48.715 --> 00:32:49.590
for causing anything.

00:32:49.590 --> 00:32:52.990
Along comes puberty, and thanks
to a whole bunch of changes

00:32:52.990 --> 00:32:56.600
in the brain, signals go out
so that testosterone levels now

00:32:56.600 --> 00:33:01.090
come roaring up into the usual,
impossible levels in the males.

00:33:01.090 --> 00:33:04.220
And what happens
here is the levels

00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:06.170
don't go up as much
as they should,

00:33:06.170 --> 00:33:09.380
because that enzyme is a
little bit on the slow side.

00:33:09.380 --> 00:33:12.330
But they go up enough
to pass threshold

00:33:12.330 --> 00:33:14.260
for beginning to have an effect.

00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:16.870
And somewhere right
around puberty,

00:33:16.870 --> 00:33:19.140
this individual changes sex.

00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:23.790
This individual
transfers, transmits,

00:33:23.790 --> 00:33:27.160
jumps ship and goes
from female to male

00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:30.040
as a result of these androgenic
effects suddenly coming in.

00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:32.330
It's not a complete
switch there,

00:33:32.330 --> 00:33:33.990
but it's somewhat
of a transition.

00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:35.560
This is bizarre.

00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:37.900
Again, this is not
something subtle.

00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:40.050
This is something
changing completely here.

00:33:40.050 --> 00:33:43.430
And again, one single mutation.

00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:46.570
And in this case, not
even a mutation wiping out

00:33:46.570 --> 00:33:49.400
the function entirely
of some protein

00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:52.800
as in PKU or Testicular
Feminization Syndrome.

00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:54.590
But now you've got
a protein that's

00:33:54.590 --> 00:33:58.480
just working differently,
slowly enough that you

00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:02.260
get this very different picture
popping out the other end.

00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:06.300
What's most interesting is you
have this intersection between

00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:09.980
molecular biology
and the bio-, endo-

00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:12.150
consequences of this
mutation, all of that.

00:34:12.150 --> 00:34:14.230
And the cultural context
of it, apparently

00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:16.600
in both of these
populations, people

00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:18.260
have kind of adapted to it.

00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:19.690
It's not a big deal.

00:34:19.690 --> 00:34:22.350
You know, puberty--
sometimes you get acne.

00:34:22.350 --> 00:34:24.009
Sometimes you get a penis.

00:34:24.009 --> 00:34:26.090
And people just deal with that.

00:34:26.090 --> 00:34:28.199
That's just part of
the whole process

00:34:28.199 --> 00:34:32.199
and cultural accommodation
to interesting biology.

00:34:32.199 --> 00:34:34.179
One final example
of where you can

00:34:34.179 --> 00:34:36.199
have a classical
type of mutation,

00:34:36.199 --> 00:34:39.280
and another version of
a very mild difference.

00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:42.060
And in this case, it is
not a very mild difference

00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:44.239
producing an overt disease.

00:34:44.239 --> 00:34:46.550
In this case, it's just
producing something

00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:49.699
that probably differs in you
from the person sitting next

00:34:49.699 --> 00:34:50.650
to you.

00:34:50.650 --> 00:34:54.110
Which is, you have a
neurochemical system,

00:34:54.110 --> 00:34:57.139
a system of chemical
messengers in your brain.

00:34:57.139 --> 00:34:58.634
If this is new stuff, hang on.

00:34:58.634 --> 00:35:00.550
It will all be explained
in a couple of weeks.

00:35:00.550 --> 00:35:03.700
But this is a class of
neurochemical signaling

00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:06.520
that has something
to do with anxiety.

00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:10.360
A chemical messenger
which decreases anxiety.

00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:12.980
And we will learn plenty
about that down the line.

00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:15.200
And there's this regular class.

00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:18.550
They're known collectively
as benzodiazepines.

00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:21.250
Do not panic if you've not
heard that word before,

00:35:21.250 --> 00:35:23.310
and certainly do not
attempt to spell it right,

00:35:23.310 --> 00:35:24.860
because it's not possible to.

00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:26.470
So benzodiazepines.

00:35:26.470 --> 00:35:29.401
There are synthetic
versions of benzodiazepines

00:35:29.401 --> 00:35:30.900
which people might
take when they're

00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:34.610
feeling anxious like
Vallium, like Librium.

00:35:34.610 --> 00:35:38.570
Vallium is the synthetic
benzodiazepine.

00:35:38.570 --> 00:35:41.950
So benzodiazepines
are protein, and they

00:35:41.950 --> 00:35:43.080
have a particular shape.

00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:46.850
And you guessed, it there are
thus benzodiazepine receptors,

00:35:46.850 --> 00:35:50.590
which could do that whole lock
and key deal going on there.

00:35:50.590 --> 00:35:53.450
And what you have
are differences,

00:35:53.450 --> 00:35:56.600
small, single point,
in this case not

00:35:56.600 --> 00:35:59.860
mutations, but simply
different versions

00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:03.770
that one letter can come in
in the DNA sequence specifying

00:36:03.770 --> 00:36:06.210
the benzodiazepine receptor.

00:36:06.210 --> 00:36:07.520
These are not mutations.

00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:12.350
This is just normal variability
is one particular spot

00:36:12.350 --> 00:36:15.300
can specify two or three
different amino acids

00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:17.330
that function roughly the same.

00:36:17.330 --> 00:36:20.800
So that you're changing somewhat
the shape of the receptor,

00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:24.740
and thus changing somewhat how
long the benzodiazepine stays

00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:27.060
in there, and how long
the signal is sent.

00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:28.360
And it's all very subtle.

00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:30.420
And what does this
begin to explain?

00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:33.930
Individual differences
in levels of anxiety.

00:36:33.930 --> 00:36:37.470
It's only one of the gazillion
ways of explaining it,

00:36:37.470 --> 00:36:39.760
but it's part of
that picture there.

00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:42.100
Here we have
individual differences.

00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:45.060
This explained a very
interesting finding.

00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:49.240
For decades, people often tried
to breed rats, different rat

00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:51.440
lines for different
behavioral traits.

00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:54.140
And it makes it
very useful models.

00:36:54.140 --> 00:36:57.030
There are alcoholism prone rats.

00:36:57.030 --> 00:36:59.730
There are rats that have
been bred for being smart,

00:36:59.730 --> 00:37:02.880
for being not as smart at
spatial maze stuff, et cetera.

00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:05.630
And for years, there'd
been a number of rat lines

00:37:05.630 --> 00:37:08.470
that have been bred that
were either high anxiety

00:37:08.470 --> 00:37:10.500
or low anxiety rats.

00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:16.710
Very useful for understanding
things like-- what are they're

00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:17.470
useful for?

00:37:17.470 --> 00:37:18.012
I don't know.

00:37:18.012 --> 00:37:19.386
They're just cool
to have around.

00:37:19.386 --> 00:37:21.550
Very useful for understand
the effects of stress,

00:37:21.550 --> 00:37:22.665
or things of that sort.

00:37:22.665 --> 00:37:26.600
So finally, modern era of
molecular biology comes in,

00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:29.270
and those high and
low anxiety strains

00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:32.670
differ in the shape of the
benzodiazepine receptor in many

00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:33.740
of these cases.

00:37:33.740 --> 00:37:36.190
Again, tiny little differences.

00:37:36.190 --> 00:37:39.470
So what we've got here
is classic old genetics

00:37:39.470 --> 00:37:41.000
at the molecular level.

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:45.030
These tiny little changes in
one single base pair at a time--

00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:47.330
point, deletion, insertion.

00:37:47.330 --> 00:37:49.950
A world in which it may or
may not change the shape.

00:37:49.950 --> 00:37:52.240
Where it could change it
dramatically and produce

00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:54.400
some pretty exciting,
dramatic diseases

00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:56.360
where you wind up with
a different gender

00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:57.590
than your chromosomes say.

00:37:57.590 --> 00:37:59.660
Ones where you get more
subtle differences.

00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:02.940
You change gender at
your 13th birthday.

00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:06.090
Or ones where we're
just for the first time

00:38:06.090 --> 00:38:09.860
beginning to look at the
individual differences that

00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:11.900
flow out from stuff like this.

00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:15.590
Not them and their disease,
but the individual variability.

00:38:15.590 --> 00:38:18.940
All of this is in the
realm of single base

00:38:18.940 --> 00:38:21.090
pairs being changed.

00:38:21.090 --> 00:38:23.300
What all of this
now allows us to do

00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:27.580
is translate this world
of mutational changes

00:38:27.580 --> 00:38:30.620
into what does this look
like evolutionarily?

00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:33.320
What does this look like
in terms of explaining

00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:34.770
patterns of evolution?

00:38:34.770 --> 00:38:37.890
And you will know exactly
where this goes right now.

00:38:37.890 --> 00:38:42.010
This helps explain
the classical,

00:38:42.010 --> 00:38:46.480
the gradualist picture of
little bits of change at a time.

00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:49.830
Little bits because you've got
one protein which now works

00:38:49.830 --> 00:38:51.890
a little bit
differently, and thus you

00:38:51.890 --> 00:38:54.700
get to ask a
sociobiology question.

00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:58.640
By having testosterone having
a little bit more of an effect

00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:00.400
or a little bit
less of an effect

00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:02.680
by way of molecular
changes in this receptor,

00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:05.320
is that going to increase
the number of copies of genes

00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:06.560
that individual has?

00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:08.750
Is it going to
decrease the number?

00:39:08.750 --> 00:39:12.030
How's it going to fit into
all of last week's science?

00:39:12.030 --> 00:39:15.010
And you will know exactly
how that drill will run.

00:39:15.010 --> 00:39:18.580
Oh, if thanks to one
single base pair changing,

00:39:18.580 --> 00:39:22.080
you now have a receptor
which functions in a slightly

00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:26.050
different way, which makes
this individual 1.5% more

00:39:26.050 --> 00:39:29.220
fertile than everybody else
that they're competing against,

00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:31.460
you just wait long
enough and come back,

00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:33.720
and everybody in
that population is

00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:36.290
going to have that
different version of it.

00:39:36.290 --> 00:39:38.330
We can run the logic there.

00:39:38.330 --> 00:39:42.210
We have variability--
Darwinian variability-- thanks

00:39:42.210 --> 00:39:43.580
to a mutation.

00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:45.700
We have differential fitness.

00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:49.320
We have just defined an adaptive
difference somehow or other.

00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:52.150
There there's a
smidgen of advantage,

00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:54.140
thanks to a slightly
different shape.

00:39:54.140 --> 00:39:57.900
And thus we have selection
changing distribution

00:39:57.900 --> 00:39:58.810
over time.

00:39:58.810 --> 00:40:01.130
The smidgen more
effective version

00:40:01.130 --> 00:40:03.820
will become more common
in the population.

00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:05.700
And what's also
intrinsic in that

00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:09.220
is that these are slow
little steps of change.

00:40:09.220 --> 00:40:10.900
This is gradualism.

00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:14.940
So gradualism is absolutely
commensurate with everything

00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:19.970
we got last week built around
adaptation, competition.

00:40:19.970 --> 00:40:21.640
Every little bit
makes a difference

00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:24.730
because 1% difference in
number of copies your genes.

00:40:24.730 --> 00:40:26.460
Run it enough
generations, and that's

00:40:26.460 --> 00:40:28.490
going to be a big
difference, and all of it

00:40:28.490 --> 00:40:32.700
changing in a very
gradualist, incremental way.

00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:34.950
This has popped up in
a number of domains

00:40:34.950 --> 00:40:37.570
and could be really useful,
because it allows you

00:40:37.570 --> 00:40:41.070
for one thing to trace
evolutionary history by looking

00:40:41.070 --> 00:40:43.580
at the changes of
single base pairs.

00:40:43.580 --> 00:40:46.940
And that's allowed for looking
at one really interesting gene,

00:40:46.940 --> 00:40:52.020
which we may talk about down
the line, a gene called Fox P2.

00:40:52.020 --> 00:40:56.890
Fox P2 has something
to do with language.

00:40:56.890 --> 00:41:01.790
Fox P2 was first identified
and a family, all of whom

00:41:01.790 --> 00:41:05.210
had some sort of language
communication problem.

00:41:05.210 --> 00:41:07.860
And people to this day
argue whether it was mostly

00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:11.380
about coordinating the
motoric aspects of speech

00:41:11.380 --> 00:41:15.010
or was it something about
grasping the symbolic message

00:41:15.010 --> 00:41:16.850
aspects of language,
all of that.

00:41:16.850 --> 00:41:19.680
In any case, a mutation
was found in this gene,

00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:21.890
and a whole cottage
industry has emerged

00:41:21.890 --> 00:41:24.990
since then of studying Fox P2.

00:41:24.990 --> 00:41:28.530
Because versions
of Fox P2 occur all

00:41:28.530 --> 00:41:32.460
throughout the animal
kingdom-- in birds, and rats,

00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:35.340
and non-human primates,
and all sorts of things.

00:41:35.340 --> 00:41:38.534
Fox P2 popping up
all over the place.

00:41:38.534 --> 00:41:39.950
And in all these
different places,

00:41:39.950 --> 00:41:42.770
it's got something to
do with communication.

00:41:42.770 --> 00:41:45.020
It's got something
to do with bird song.

00:41:45.020 --> 00:41:49.070
It's got something to do with
rat ultrasonic vocalizations.

00:41:49.070 --> 00:41:51.910
Rats are constantly jabbering
at each other in a range

00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:52.990
that we can't hear.

00:41:52.990 --> 00:41:56.180
And Fox P2 has something
to do within all of those.

00:41:56.180 --> 00:42:01.190
And different versions of Fox P2
in all these different species.

00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:03.440
And what becomes
most pertinent is

00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:05.530
when you look at
those differences,

00:42:05.530 --> 00:42:08.130
you will see tiny
little differences

00:42:08.130 --> 00:42:10.950
in this tree across all
these different species.

00:42:10.950 --> 00:42:15.250
One base pair difference
between rats and mice.

00:42:15.250 --> 00:42:19.570
One base pair difference
between hawks and elephants.

00:42:19.570 --> 00:42:20.970
That sort of thing varies.

00:42:20.970 --> 00:42:26.030
And then you look out at humans,
and a whole bunch of changes.

00:42:26.030 --> 00:42:30.010
A whole bunch of changes in a
very short evolutionary period.

00:42:30.010 --> 00:42:32.780
What this suggests
is no wonder this

00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:35.880
is producing some very
different stuff than these guys.

00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:37.850
A very different gene.

00:42:37.850 --> 00:42:39.460
And a very different
gene, people

00:42:39.460 --> 00:42:41.910
now have been able
to back calculate

00:42:41.910 --> 00:42:46.410
due to a series of single
base pair changes somewhere

00:42:46.410 --> 00:42:49.490
in the last quarter
million years or so.

00:42:49.490 --> 00:42:51.050
And that makes a difference.

00:42:51.050 --> 00:42:53.640
Totally cool,
unsettling experiment

00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:55.290
that was done a few
years ago, which

00:42:55.290 --> 00:42:59.410
was some people taking the
human version of Fox P2

00:42:59.410 --> 00:43:03.320
and knocking out a mouse line,
knocking out their own Fox P2

00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:07.380
and sticky in the human version
and seeing what happens.

00:43:07.380 --> 00:43:09.370
And it was very interesting.

00:43:09.370 --> 00:43:12.640
They immediately sing the theme
song from all the Mickey Mouse

00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:13.563
cartoons.

00:43:13.563 --> 00:43:15.040
Ha, can they prove that?

00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:19.210
OK, what you see is you've
got more complex types

00:43:19.210 --> 00:43:22.860
of ultrasonic vocalization
in these mice.

00:43:22.860 --> 00:43:24.890
That's really interesting.

00:43:24.890 --> 00:43:27.210
And there's years
of stuff to sort out

00:43:27.210 --> 00:43:28.530
what's going on with that.

00:43:28.530 --> 00:43:30.960
For our purposes, the
main thing is here

00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:34.500
you have wound up with a very
different world than chirping,

00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:37.300
and buzzing, and
barking, and all of that.

00:43:37.300 --> 00:43:39.790
And you wind up with a
very different version

00:43:39.790 --> 00:43:43.950
of this gene where you can
trace out how many amino acid

00:43:43.950 --> 00:43:45.170
changes it took.

00:43:45.170 --> 00:43:47.390
And every step of
the way, you were

00:43:47.390 --> 00:43:50.610
having some gradualist process.

00:43:50.610 --> 00:43:53.400
What also this
allows you to do is

00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:58.800
look at a footprint, an echo
of what the selection was like.

00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:00.470
Important concept here.

00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:02.190
So back to that business.

00:44:02.190 --> 00:44:05.570
There's 64 different ways
of coding for amino acids,

00:44:05.570 --> 00:44:08.840
a couple of them are just
informational, stop messages,

00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:09.360
and stuff.

00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:13.480
There's about 60 different ways
of coding for 20 amino acids.

00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:15.760
So on the average,
each amino acid

00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:19.450
could be coded for in
three different ways.

00:44:19.450 --> 00:44:24.810
So suppose you throw
in a random mutation.

00:44:24.810 --> 00:44:30.540
And of those, what you find is
of the 60 possible mutations,

00:44:30.540 --> 00:44:34.850
40 of them will not cause
a change in the amino acid.

00:44:34.850 --> 00:44:39.600
Statistically, 2/3 of the time,
there will not be a change.

00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:41.510
So in other words,
if you scatter

00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:44.880
a whole bunch of
mutations, and you wind up

00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:49.810
seeing 2/3 are neutral in
terms of their consequence,

00:44:49.810 --> 00:44:53.890
and 1/3 third actually causes a
change in an amino acid, that's

00:44:53.890 --> 00:44:57.180
telling you it's happening
at the random expected rate

00:44:57.180 --> 00:45:01.620
of mutations popping up that are
either consequential-- changing

00:45:01.620 --> 00:45:04.590
an amino acid-- or
inconsequential-- just coding

00:45:04.590 --> 00:45:08.390
for a different version
of the same amino acid.

00:45:08.390 --> 00:45:11.940
Now suppose you find
a gene that differs.

00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:14.170
And you look at the ways
in which it differs.

00:45:14.170 --> 00:45:17.220
And 99% of the base
pair differences

00:45:17.220 --> 00:45:19.700
over the course
of this 5 million

00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:23.420
base pair-along gene,
99% of the differences

00:45:23.420 --> 00:45:27.450
make for a different amino
acid than beforehand.

00:45:27.450 --> 00:45:30.540
In other words, at much
higher than expected rate

00:45:30.540 --> 00:45:32.520
if this was a random process.

00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:34.316
What is this an echo of?

00:45:34.316 --> 00:45:37.400
Of very strong selection.

00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:42.630
Of very strongly advantageous
traits driven by these changes.

00:45:42.630 --> 00:45:44.980
Term used-- this would
be a mark of their

00:45:44.980 --> 00:45:49.160
having been positive
selection for this trait.

00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:51.850
In other words, the changes
that it has gone through

00:45:51.850 --> 00:45:54.510
over the gazillion
years has not been just

00:45:54.510 --> 00:45:57.970
by random mutational
rates of neutral.

00:45:57.970 --> 00:46:01.130
And remember, every amino
acid is coded for three ways.

00:46:01.130 --> 00:46:04.080
If 99% of them
are consequential,

00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:09.100
there has been some major, hard
ass selection going on there.

00:46:09.100 --> 00:46:11.580
Alternatively, if
you find a long gene

00:46:11.580 --> 00:46:15.950
with a whole bunch of mutations
and 99% of them are neutral,

00:46:15.950 --> 00:46:18.540
make no change at all,
what does that tell you?

00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:20.990
This protein's function
you do not want

00:46:20.990 --> 00:46:22.700
to mess with in the slightest.

00:46:22.700 --> 00:46:25.710
Even a minor change in the
function of it, and you

00:46:25.710 --> 00:46:27.880
don't pass on copies
of your genes.

00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:32.330
This would be stabilizing
selection, negative selection,

00:46:32.330 --> 00:46:37.640
strong selection to make sure
that this gene and its function

00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:40.610
downline as the protein
does not change.

00:46:40.610 --> 00:46:45.390
When you look at the number of
changes, the burst of mutations

00:46:45.390 --> 00:46:48.280
over the last quarter million
years or so that differentiated

00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:51.460
Fox P2 in humans from
these other species,

00:46:51.460 --> 00:46:55.500
it's almost entirely evidences
of positive selection.

00:46:55.500 --> 00:46:58.650
This did not just
happen by chance.

00:46:58.650 --> 00:47:02.030
Every step of coming up
with these new versions,

00:47:02.030 --> 00:47:04.600
these new amino acids
in the sequence there,

00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:08.250
clearly were ones that were
positively selected for.

00:47:08.250 --> 00:47:12.000
A lot of selection brought
about this huge difference.

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:12.500
OK.

00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:16.360
So that begins to give
the sense here of how

00:47:16.360 --> 00:47:18.470
these little changes can occur.

00:47:18.470 --> 00:47:20.160
At this point, we
have to go through one

00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:23.750
of the all time confusing
things in genetics out there,

00:47:23.750 --> 00:47:26.980
which is something two
factoids and two soundbites

00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:30.920
that seemingly totally
contradict with each other.

00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:34.460
You share, on the
average, 50% of your DNA

00:47:34.460 --> 00:47:37.430
with a full sibling.

00:47:37.430 --> 00:47:42.890
You share 98% of your
DNA with chimpanzees.

00:47:42.890 --> 00:47:44.560
What's up with that?

00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:46.920
That seems a little
bit unexpected.

00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:49.700
And those are two soundbites
that everybody knows.

00:47:49.700 --> 00:47:52.010
Everybody knows it goes
through like basic Mendel.

00:47:52.010 --> 00:47:57.180
50%, 100% with an identical
twin, 50% with a full sibling.

00:47:57.180 --> 00:47:59.050
You know that song
and dance by now.

00:47:59.050 --> 00:48:02.100
And meanwhile, one of
the great soundbites

00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:05.980
of our evolutionary history, and
the mark of evolution, and what

00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:07.860
in hell are you
creationists thinking,

00:48:07.860 --> 00:48:11.160
is the fact that, oh, humans
share 98% of their DNA

00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:12.270
with chimps.

00:48:12.270 --> 00:48:13.950
This doesn't make any sense.

00:48:13.950 --> 00:48:17.110
One minute here to be spent on
just clarifying that one that

00:48:17.110 --> 00:48:19.450
is not contradictory at all.

00:48:19.450 --> 00:48:22.695
Genes specify by
way of proteins--

00:48:22.695 --> 00:48:24.320
and now this is taking
a bunch of leaps

00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:28.390
down there-- traits, aspects.

00:48:28.390 --> 00:48:31.510
Gene specify, to be
totally simplifying here,

00:48:31.510 --> 00:48:35.810
genes specify for
antlers, for dorsal fins,

00:48:35.810 --> 00:48:40.210
for petals, and pistils
and stamens, for kidneys,

00:48:40.210 --> 00:48:42.760
for-- it's totally simplifying.

00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:46.610
So right off the bat, you will
have some genetic similarities

00:48:46.610 --> 00:48:49.200
between two different
species in that both of them

00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:52.600
will have genes that
code for dorsal fins.

00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:55.280
You're thinking about two
different species of whales.

00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:59.550
So they share genes
coding for dorsal fins.

00:48:59.550 --> 00:49:00.910
Whales have dorsal fins.

00:49:00.910 --> 00:49:04.960
Neither we nor chimpanzees
have genes for dorsal fins.

00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:08.950
Meanwhile, we have genes
coding for a pelvis that

00:49:08.950 --> 00:49:11.410
has a certain shape
which either in chimps

00:49:11.410 --> 00:49:14.120
predisposes towards being
able to walk bipedal

00:49:14.120 --> 00:49:16.160
for certain strengths
of the length of time.

00:49:16.160 --> 00:49:16.980
Us as well.

00:49:16.980 --> 00:49:20.670
You don't find these
genes in apple trees.

00:49:20.670 --> 00:49:23.100
They don't have pelvises
that are shaped like those,

00:49:23.100 --> 00:49:24.260
so they don't have.

00:49:24.260 --> 00:49:27.150
So when you look at the
human and the chimp genome,

00:49:27.150 --> 00:49:32.580
98% of the genes code for
similar kind of things.

00:49:32.580 --> 00:49:35.240
We share with chimps
an absence of genes

00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:41.365
for antlers, and trunks,
and tusks, and wings,

00:49:41.365 --> 00:49:43.000
or serve who knows what.

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:44.950
And we share all
sorts of other genes

00:49:44.950 --> 00:49:47.900
in common having to do with
our shared immune systems,

00:49:47.900 --> 00:49:48.910
et cetera, et cetera.

00:49:48.910 --> 00:49:53.930
So 98% of the genes code
for similar types of things.

00:49:53.930 --> 00:49:56.700
So that's where we get the
98% similarity with the chimps

00:49:56.700 --> 00:49:57.330
from.

00:49:57.330 --> 00:49:59.410
For each one of
those genes, it could

00:49:59.410 --> 00:50:01.610
come in a couple of
different flavors,

00:50:01.610 --> 00:50:03.520
a bunch of different flavors.

00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:08.480
And thus asking not to do
both you and your full sibling

00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:12.450
have a gene for
opposable thumbs, do you

00:50:12.450 --> 00:50:14.560
and your sibling
have the same type

00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:16.570
of gene for opposable thumbs?

00:50:16.570 --> 00:50:18.840
So suddenly that's
a different world

00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:22.080
of variants on
each type of gene.

00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:25.680
So when talking about the
amount of DNA shared in common,

00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:28.480
the genes shared in common
with other species, what you're

00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:31.190
talking about are
the types of genes

00:50:31.190 --> 00:50:33.420
coding for the types of traits.

00:50:33.420 --> 00:50:36.190
When we're talking about,
from last week's notion,

00:50:36.190 --> 00:50:40.340
50%, 25%, 12.5%, one
brother and eight cousins,

00:50:40.340 --> 00:50:42.890
what you're talking about
are different versions

00:50:42.890 --> 00:50:44.540
of particular genes.

00:50:44.540 --> 00:50:46.430
Important clarification.

00:50:46.430 --> 00:50:49.890
So final thing here before the
break, which is once again,

00:50:49.890 --> 00:50:53.180
notice with these models,
these point mutations,

00:50:53.180 --> 00:50:55.840
where you can get slight
differences in function.

00:50:55.840 --> 00:50:58.910
And thanks to a 1% difference
in fitness and number

00:50:58.910 --> 00:51:02.510
of copies of genes, you get
these gradualist changes.

00:51:02.510 --> 00:51:04.630
What's intrinsic
in that, and where

00:51:04.630 --> 00:51:07.680
we get the political
theme coming through is,

00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:10.550
thus there's
competition everywhere.

00:51:10.550 --> 00:51:12.740
In terms of the
evolution of behavior,

00:51:12.740 --> 00:51:17.830
the evolution of species, every
little bit of genetic advantage

00:51:17.830 --> 00:51:20.580
will play out in
some competitive way

00:51:20.580 --> 00:51:23.020
in some little
bit of an increase

00:51:23.020 --> 00:51:24.288
in reproductive success.

00:51:27.780 --> 00:51:28.660
OK.

00:51:28.660 --> 00:51:32.854
Whoa, there's a lot of
Apples there lit up.

00:51:35.580 --> 00:51:37.350
Well, that wasn't very subtle.

00:51:37.350 --> 00:51:38.690
Let's take a break.

00:51:38.690 --> 00:51:40.425
Whoever did that.

00:51:40.425 --> 00:51:42.890
OK, a five minute break.

00:51:42.890 --> 00:51:45.700
Are you slightly
more fit by the rules

00:51:45.700 --> 00:51:49.640
of your population's natural
selection, sexual selection,

00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:50.410
whatever?

00:51:50.410 --> 00:51:52.580
Even if that gives
you a tiny advantage

00:51:52.580 --> 00:51:55.410
thanks to this tiny
change in this tiny gene,

00:51:55.410 --> 00:51:58.280
enough generations
go by, and that trait

00:51:58.280 --> 00:52:00.150
is going to become
more prevalent.

00:52:00.150 --> 00:52:04.720
Final point there intrinsic in
this, is if every little bit

00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:07.970
of difference matters in
terms of fitness and gene

00:52:07.970 --> 00:52:10.950
distribution within
the realm of behavior,

00:52:10.950 --> 00:52:14.180
every little bit of
competition matters.

00:52:14.180 --> 00:52:19.300
A very, very intertwined
political, philosophical stance

00:52:19.300 --> 00:52:23.500
in gradualism as it
applies to evolution.

00:52:23.500 --> 00:52:26.230
So that's been sitting
there around forever.

00:52:26.230 --> 00:52:30.810
And in the 1980s, suddenly a
very different model emerged.

00:52:30.810 --> 00:52:33.390
And this came from
Stephen Jay Gould, who

00:52:33.390 --> 00:52:35.280
we heard about the other day.

00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:37.930
Stephen Jay Gould,
and the person,

00:52:37.930 --> 00:52:40.550
the poor schnook who
was always lost in this,

00:52:40.550 --> 00:52:43.800
another evolutionary biologist
named Niles Eldridge who

00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:46.280
somehow did not quite have
the press that Stephen Jay

00:52:46.280 --> 00:52:49.309
Gould did, so he is lost to
history except for people

00:52:49.309 --> 00:52:50.350
who know what he's up to.

00:52:50.350 --> 00:52:51.940
And he's an amazing scientist.

00:52:51.940 --> 00:52:56.330
But Gould and Eldridge came up
with a very different model.

00:52:56.330 --> 00:53:01.520
And I alluded to it the other
day and drew it right there.

00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:05.930
And their notion was that
gradualism is nonsense.

00:53:05.930 --> 00:53:09.510
There are not gradualistic
incremental changes.

00:53:09.510 --> 00:53:14.180
Evolution is not being driven
by small gradualist changes.

00:53:14.180 --> 00:53:16.850
Instead, what their
model was is that there's

00:53:16.850 --> 00:53:22.410
long periods of nothing
happening, of stasis.

00:53:22.410 --> 00:53:24.340
Long periods of
nothing happening.

00:53:24.340 --> 00:53:28.320
If there's changes in DNA
sequences thanks to mutations,

00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:30.060
they're not consequential.

00:53:30.060 --> 00:53:32.030
Or if they're
consequential enough

00:53:32.030 --> 00:53:34.920
to change the fitness
of one organism 1%,

00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:36.730
that's not going to
make a difference.

00:53:36.730 --> 00:53:39.740
Most of the time, no
change is occurring.

00:53:39.740 --> 00:53:43.470
And when it does occur,
it is in incredibly fast,

00:53:43.470 --> 00:53:47.360
explosive periods
of change followed

00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:49.400
by a new period of stasis.

00:53:49.400 --> 00:53:53.380
Evolutionary change comes in
step functions rather than

00:53:53.380 --> 00:53:54.900
smooth gradualism.

00:53:54.900 --> 00:53:59.240
Long periods of stasis
followed by dramatic jumps

00:53:59.240 --> 00:54:02.910
of evolutionary change
in short periods of time.

00:54:02.910 --> 00:54:04.910
Thus, they called
this the notion

00:54:04.910 --> 00:54:07.020
of punctuated equilibrium.

00:54:07.020 --> 00:54:10.090
Long periods of
equilibrium and stasis

00:54:10.090 --> 00:54:14.030
punctuated by periods
of very rapid change.

00:54:14.030 --> 00:54:19.120
And as I mentioned the other
day, Gould was a Marxist

00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:21.160
and felt that Marxist's
sort of stance

00:54:21.160 --> 00:54:24.150
was running through all of the
ways to think about genetics.

00:54:24.150 --> 00:54:26.316
And I don't now what's
up with Niles Eldredge,

00:54:26.316 --> 00:54:27.690
but that was the
case with Gould.

00:54:27.690 --> 00:54:29.420
And when you look
at this model, this

00:54:29.420 --> 00:54:33.480
is like classically
fitting with stasis,

00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:37.160
and revolutionary change,
and dialectical materialism,

00:54:37.160 --> 00:54:38.170
and stuff like that.

00:54:38.170 --> 00:54:40.720
The last sentence, I have
no idea what I just said.

00:54:40.720 --> 00:54:42.390
But apparently
that's got something

00:54:42.390 --> 00:54:43.810
to do with that stuff.

00:54:43.810 --> 00:54:46.950
And once again, we see
in a very different way,

00:54:46.950 --> 00:54:50.100
a political theme running
through a different worlds

00:54:50.100 --> 00:54:54.290
view of what evolution is
about-- punctuated equilibrium.

00:54:54.290 --> 00:54:56.960
OK, so where did the idea
of punctuated equilibrium

00:54:56.960 --> 00:54:58.450
come to these guys?

00:54:58.450 --> 00:55:02.420
Mainly because Gould
was not a biologist.

00:55:02.420 --> 00:55:05.330
He was certainly not an
evolutionary biologist.

00:55:05.330 --> 00:55:07.670
What he was a paleontologist.

00:55:07.670 --> 00:55:11.130
He studied fossils.

00:55:11.130 --> 00:55:13.810
He studied the history,
the evolutionary history

00:55:13.810 --> 00:55:14.720
of fossils.

00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:16.560
And apparently, like
totally separate

00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:19.240
of his large
theoretical models, he

00:55:19.240 --> 00:55:21.410
was like the world's
expert on the evolution

00:55:21.410 --> 00:55:25.800
of some Caribbean snail shell
over the last 10 billion years

00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:26.550
or something.

00:55:26.550 --> 00:55:28.940
He's one of those
paleontologists who

00:55:28.940 --> 00:55:34.140
traces lineages of evolutionary
change over the course of time

00:55:34.140 --> 00:55:38.050
with fossils, fossil
records, as the readout.

00:55:38.050 --> 00:55:42.070
So he's a paleontologist
slash geologist in some ways.

00:55:42.070 --> 00:55:45.020
And when you do that, you notice
something, which is you've

00:55:45.020 --> 00:55:46.730
got gaps in the record.

00:55:46.730 --> 00:55:49.230
You've got your
famed missing links.

00:55:49.230 --> 00:55:51.980
You have gaps in your
evolutionary record

00:55:51.980 --> 00:55:53.770
there of what fossils look like.

00:55:53.770 --> 00:55:57.550
And you're measuring some
trait or other in these snails,

00:55:57.550 --> 00:55:59.990
or trilobites, or whatever
you're looking at.

00:55:59.990 --> 00:56:02.600
And at this time period,
the trait looks like this.

00:56:02.600 --> 00:56:04.270
At this time period,
it looks like this.

00:56:04.270 --> 00:56:07.220
And this looks like a perfectly
good gradualist model.

00:56:07.220 --> 00:56:09.760
And what Gould would
notice is as the field got

00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:13.720
more and more information,
more and more intervening steps

00:56:13.720 --> 00:56:16.340
on a lot of these
fossil histories,

00:56:16.340 --> 00:56:21.100
they would start to
look more like this.

00:56:21.100 --> 00:56:23.750
And every now and then,
you would see something

00:56:23.750 --> 00:56:25.320
like this in between.

00:56:25.320 --> 00:56:28.810
And from that, that begin
to suggest to him this model

00:56:28.810 --> 00:56:31.310
of punctuated equilibrium.

00:56:31.310 --> 00:56:34.610
Most of the time, as assessed
by the fossil record,

00:56:34.610 --> 00:56:38.690
nothing dramatic is happening--
long periods of stasis.

00:56:38.690 --> 00:56:41.620
And what allowed this to occur
is that for some fossils,

00:56:41.620 --> 00:56:45.570
you have incredibly detailed
evolutionary history, where

00:56:45.570 --> 00:56:48.780
you can begin to fill in
lines, and they wind up

00:56:48.780 --> 00:56:51.240
looking punctuated in this way.

00:56:51.240 --> 00:56:53.700
So out of him comes
this whole theory

00:56:53.700 --> 00:56:56.750
that it's all about punctuated
equilibrium rather than

00:56:56.750 --> 00:56:58.020
gradualism.

00:56:58.020 --> 00:57:01.330
Right off the bat, what are
the consequences of that?

00:57:01.330 --> 00:57:04.980
Little genetic
changes don't matter.

00:57:04.980 --> 00:57:09.980
Competition driven by the notion
of little changes mattering

00:57:09.980 --> 00:57:11.550
aren't actually occurring.

00:57:11.550 --> 00:57:13.910
In model [? saying ?]
most of the time, all

00:57:13.910 --> 00:57:17.480
of the notions of if you figure
out the right kid to kidnap

00:57:17.480 --> 00:57:19.100
when the big guy
is coming at you,

00:57:19.100 --> 00:57:21.170
and you'll leave more
copies, and figuring out

00:57:21.170 --> 00:57:24.240
exactly who to be
infanticidal to, all that,

00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:25.720
it's not going to
make a difference

00:57:25.720 --> 00:57:27.470
in terms of gene distribution.

00:57:27.470 --> 00:57:30.450
Evolution is not
being driven by that.

00:57:30.450 --> 00:57:33.660
And out of it came this
very strong indictment

00:57:33.660 --> 00:57:36.380
of the sociobiological
view of what you've

00:57:36.380 --> 00:57:40.360
got there is a world where it's
all about competition, where

00:57:40.360 --> 00:57:44.470
it's all about hierarchy, where
it's all about domination,

00:57:44.470 --> 00:57:45.800
where it's all about that.

00:57:45.800 --> 00:57:47.810
Hey, isn't that interesting
that that's exactly

00:57:47.810 --> 00:57:49.434
the sort of world
that these folks live

00:57:49.434 --> 00:57:52.010
in who are benefiting from
this, who started this theory?

00:57:52.010 --> 00:57:54.080
Very different notion here.

00:57:54.080 --> 00:57:57.430
Competition, selective
advantages, all of that,

00:57:57.430 --> 00:58:00.750
most of the time,
nothing's happening.

00:58:00.750 --> 00:58:03.150
So not surprisingly, all
of the evolutionary types

00:58:03.150 --> 00:58:05.980
from last week did
not like this one bit.

00:58:05.980 --> 00:58:09.090
And this was an
attacked left and right

00:58:09.090 --> 00:58:11.700
in some extremely valid ways.

00:58:11.700 --> 00:58:16.360
First one, first form of attack
is a very simple problem there,

00:58:16.360 --> 00:58:22.250
which is that you have two
different disciplines happening

00:58:22.250 --> 00:58:23.430
here.

00:58:23.430 --> 00:58:25.560
You get a
paleontologist, and you

00:58:25.560 --> 00:58:28.810
get a evolutionary
biologist, and they're

00:58:28.810 --> 00:58:31.110
functioning in completely
different universes.

00:58:34.970 --> 00:58:36.800
OK, stomach problems.

00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:39.370
And they're functioning in
completely different universes

00:58:39.370 --> 00:58:39.870
there.

00:58:39.870 --> 00:58:43.030
What counts as fast
for a paleontologist--

00:58:43.030 --> 00:58:46.753
these are tens of millions
of years going on.

00:58:46.753 --> 00:58:50.560
Whoa, incredibly fast
evolutionary change

00:58:50.560 --> 00:58:51.710
going on there.

00:58:51.710 --> 00:58:54.640
That's like 100,000 years.

00:58:54.640 --> 00:58:56.590
That's like, are you kidding me?

00:58:56.590 --> 00:58:58.380
Said the biologists.

00:58:58.380 --> 00:59:00.910
The ones who study one
generation at a time.

00:59:00.910 --> 00:59:02.340
That is asinine.

00:59:02.340 --> 00:59:03.690
That is ridiculous.

00:59:03.690 --> 00:59:06.450
This is them
imposing models where

00:59:06.450 --> 00:59:10.070
this has absolutely nothing to
do with how evolution actually

00:59:10.070 --> 00:59:10.650
works.

00:59:10.650 --> 00:59:14.110
These geologists get
completely thrown off,

00:59:14.110 --> 00:59:17.760
and these paleontologists
led by Gould, simply

00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:20.820
orders of magnitude
different scale of time.

00:59:20.820 --> 00:59:23.560
Yeah, maybe in some rough
approximation of what

00:59:23.560 --> 00:59:24.310
they look at.

00:59:24.310 --> 00:59:26.880
But they're not
studying evolution,

00:59:26.880 --> 00:59:29.630
because they're not biologists.

00:59:29.630 --> 00:59:34.430
Next critique-- the next
one made lots of sense also.

00:59:34.430 --> 00:59:38.480
Which was, you're not just
an evolutionary biologist,

00:59:38.480 --> 00:59:42.580
but you're one who thinks about
the evolution of the brain,

00:59:42.580 --> 00:59:48.100
or the evolution
of skin melanism,

00:59:48.100 --> 00:59:51.269
or the evolution of eye
color, or the evolution of how

00:59:51.269 --> 00:59:53.310
many chambers in your
heart you're going to have,

00:59:53.310 --> 00:59:55.600
or the evolution of
any of these things

00:59:55.600 --> 00:59:59.040
that will leave no
record whatsoever

00:59:59.040 --> 01:00:01.510
in the paleontological record.

01:00:01.510 --> 01:00:03.610
Because all
paleontology is about

01:00:03.610 --> 01:00:07.190
is shapes of stuff-- fossils.

01:00:07.190 --> 01:00:10.110
Fossils do not tell
you what kind of brain

01:00:10.110 --> 01:00:12.510
was going on inside that fern.

01:00:12.510 --> 01:00:16.000
Fossils do not tell you
anything about internal organs.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.890
Fossils do not tell you
anything about behavior.

01:00:18.890 --> 01:00:21.800
So at this point, all of
the evolutionary folks

01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:25.570
of the school from last
week attack and say, Yeah,

01:00:25.570 --> 01:00:26.420
what do they expect?

01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:29.270
They're studying the most
boring possible things--

01:00:29.270 --> 01:00:31.520
the morphology of organisms.

01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:34.260
Ooh, just because
the fact that humans,

01:00:34.260 --> 01:00:37.110
over the last like million
years or so, have not

01:00:37.110 --> 01:00:40.330
evolved getting rid of
the large trunk and roots

01:00:40.330 --> 01:00:42.530
that they have
during springtime,

01:00:42.530 --> 01:00:43.820
and now they don't have them.

01:00:43.820 --> 01:00:45.890
Oh, that morphological
change didn't occur,

01:00:45.890 --> 01:00:47.750
so obviously
there's been stasis.

01:00:47.750 --> 01:00:48.970
Give me a break.

01:00:48.970 --> 01:00:51.420
What is interesting
about evolution

01:00:51.420 --> 01:00:53.860
and evolutionary
change, paleontologists

01:00:53.860 --> 01:00:56.110
can't pick up, because
all they can study

01:00:56.110 --> 01:00:59.220
are forms, morphology.

01:00:59.220 --> 01:01:01.780
So that was a big
attack on these folks.

01:01:01.780 --> 01:01:04.250
So you've got the
Gouldian folks,

01:01:04.250 --> 01:01:06.220
the punctuated
equilibrium people,

01:01:06.220 --> 01:01:08.260
saying when you look
at the fossil record,

01:01:08.260 --> 01:01:09.960
it's not gradualism.

01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:12.400
And we've got some
really complete ones.

01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:16.020
And to this day, the
majority of fossil pedigrees

01:01:16.020 --> 01:01:17.730
where there are
very, very complete

01:01:17.730 --> 01:01:21.010
records, show patterns of
punctuated equilibrium.

01:01:21.010 --> 01:01:24.230
And back come the rejoinders,
this is ridiculous,

01:01:24.230 --> 01:01:26.270
the time span they talk about.

01:01:26.270 --> 01:01:27.330
That makes no sense.

01:01:27.330 --> 01:01:32.290
In this period, humans evolved,
doubled their brain size

01:01:32.290 --> 01:01:35.360
in the length of time that
they call a very rapid

01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:36.590
evolutionary change.

01:01:36.590 --> 01:01:38.410
Their time span is
completely crazy,

01:01:38.410 --> 01:01:41.460
and they can't study the
evolution of anything

01:01:41.460 --> 01:01:44.190
that's interesting because
they study fossils.

01:01:44.190 --> 01:01:47.070
But in lots of ways,
the best rebuttal,

01:01:47.070 --> 01:01:49.220
the one that most
got at these folks

01:01:49.220 --> 01:01:51.100
advocating punctuated
equilibrium,

01:01:51.100 --> 01:01:55.950
would be the gradualists saying,
Show me a molecular mechanism.

01:01:55.950 --> 01:02:00.810
Show me some way in which you
can get rapid change and then

01:02:00.810 --> 01:02:02.010
long stasis.

01:02:02.010 --> 01:02:04.910
Turn that into modern
molecular biology.

01:02:04.910 --> 01:02:07.270
Which is, occurring
two minutes after

01:02:07.270 --> 01:02:10.520
the microevolutionary people
were trashing the folks

01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:13.320
from last week saying, You need
to look for the actual genes.

01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:15.240
It's not enough just
to make up stories.

01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:19.220
And once these folks had
assimilated what evolution

01:02:19.220 --> 01:02:22.060
looks like on the genetic
level, mutational level,

01:02:22.060 --> 01:02:25.610
micromutational changes,
they loved genetics.

01:02:25.610 --> 01:02:27.200
They loved the
molecular end of it,

01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:29.680
because they could now turn
around to the Gouldians

01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:34.750
and say, Show me the genes, and
show me the mutations that will

01:02:34.750 --> 01:02:36.340
account for stuff like this.

01:02:36.340 --> 01:02:37.980
Because you can't
account for it.

01:02:37.980 --> 01:02:40.930
Because we all know classical
genetics and mutation,

01:02:40.930 --> 01:02:42.120
you don't get that.

01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:44.050
You get gradualism.

01:02:44.050 --> 01:02:47.730
So this was a period of enormous
hostility between the two

01:02:47.730 --> 01:02:48.610
camps.

01:02:48.610 --> 01:02:53.790
And the gradualists called the
punctuated equilibrium people

01:02:53.790 --> 01:02:56.560
evolutionary jerks.

01:02:56.560 --> 01:02:58.890
Ha ha.

01:02:58.890 --> 01:03:01.030
And the punctuated
equilibrium people

01:03:01.030 --> 01:03:04.400
called the gradualists creeps.

01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:07.620
So ultimately, they all
got along wonderfully

01:03:07.620 --> 01:03:08.900
because they were so witty.

01:03:08.900 --> 01:03:12.600
But what you had was
enormously hostile camps.

01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:15.330
And really quite
hostile because all

01:03:15.330 --> 01:03:17.800
sorts of implications
spreading beyond

01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:20.600
like how fast the
shape of this seashell

01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:22.880
was going to be evolving.

01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:25.770
And when they first
came on in the '80s, all

01:03:25.770 --> 01:03:29.280
of this controversy, the
punctuated equilibrium people

01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:31.820
didn't have a word
to say with the show

01:03:31.820 --> 01:03:33.750
me the molecular mechanisms.

01:03:33.750 --> 01:03:38.530
Show me mechanisms for mutation
that will produce rapid change.

01:03:38.530 --> 01:03:41.230
And everything that
has occurred since then

01:03:41.230 --> 01:03:42.980
in the world of
molecular genetics

01:03:42.980 --> 01:03:46.690
that has been most striking has
supported punctuated models--

01:03:46.690 --> 01:03:49.350
ways in which the
micromutational,

01:03:49.350 --> 01:03:52.220
microevolutionary
stuff of an hour ago

01:03:52.220 --> 01:03:56.480
is not what's going on
an awful lot of the time.

01:03:56.480 --> 01:03:59.960
Starters-- so simple
classical model.

01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:03.730
What we've got here
is a stretch of DNA.

01:04:03.730 --> 01:04:07.370
And this box
symbolizes a sequence

01:04:07.370 --> 01:04:10.120
of DNA coding for one gene.

01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:13.090
And right next to
it, once it finishes,

01:04:13.090 --> 01:04:17.064
one of those stop codon,
stop triplet signals,

01:04:17.064 --> 01:04:18.480
right after that
comes the stretch

01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:20.910
of DNA coding for the next
gene, and the next gene.

01:04:20.910 --> 01:04:22.550
And this is what DNA is about.

01:04:22.550 --> 01:04:25.660
It's the sequence genes there.

01:04:25.660 --> 01:04:27.530
And what you would
obviously then get

01:04:27.530 --> 01:04:31.110
is this arrow having this
intervening step of that RNA

01:04:31.110 --> 01:04:34.380
stuff, but eventually producing
an amino acid that produces

01:04:34.380 --> 01:04:35.530
a protein of this shape.

01:04:35.530 --> 01:04:38.880
And this is the protein
coded for by this gene.

01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:41.810
This, this, and so on, and
that's exactly how it works.

01:04:41.810 --> 01:04:44.790
That's the structure of DNA.

01:04:44.790 --> 01:04:48.260
Then, though, people began
to find that that's not

01:04:48.260 --> 01:04:49.960
the structure of DNA.

01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:51.700
And what you began
to get instead

01:04:51.700 --> 01:04:54.830
was something vastly
more interesting.

01:04:54.830 --> 01:04:57.160
Which is that,
for starters, when

01:04:57.160 --> 01:04:59.910
you look at coding
for one single gene,

01:04:59.910 --> 01:05:04.400
it's not necessarily coded
for in one continuous stretch

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:06.260
of DNA.

01:05:06.260 --> 01:05:09.610
In other words, it's
broken into little pieces.

01:05:09.610 --> 01:05:11.830
And you will have
a stretch of DNA

01:05:11.830 --> 01:05:14.600
coding for the first
third of the protein,

01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:18.310
and then a bunch of DNA that's
got nothing to do with it.

01:05:18.310 --> 01:05:19.250
Stay tuned.

01:05:19.250 --> 01:05:22.160
Then coding for the next third,
coding for the next third,

01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:27.740
that the gene was broken up
into separate coding domains.

01:05:27.740 --> 01:05:30.510
And the term that was
given for these was these

01:05:30.510 --> 01:05:32.830
were called exons.

01:05:32.830 --> 01:05:36.610
And the in-between boring
stuff were called introns.

01:05:36.610 --> 01:05:41.520
And this was a major finding
which made no sense whatsoever.

01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:44.340
Because how are you going to
get from this to then having

01:05:44.340 --> 01:05:47.850
a protein which has its
normal sequence and shape

01:05:47.850 --> 01:05:51.390
where this part was coded
for by this exon, Exon

01:05:51.390 --> 01:05:55.440
One of this gene, and this from
Exon Two, this from Exon Three.

01:05:55.440 --> 01:05:58.352
That's a completely
different world of stuff.

01:05:58.352 --> 01:05:59.560
How are you going to do that?

01:05:59.560 --> 01:06:02.330
Because you're
going to meet an RNA

01:06:02.330 --> 01:06:04.262
that's going to
encompass all of this,

01:06:04.262 --> 01:06:06.720
and that's going to code for
something completely different

01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:09.690
because you've got these
introns in between there.

01:06:09.690 --> 01:06:11.650
And people then
guessed something

01:06:11.650 --> 01:06:15.390
had to exist which was
soon discovered-- enzymes

01:06:15.390 --> 01:06:18.400
called splicing enzymes.

01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:20.440
And what they did
was exactly what

01:06:20.440 --> 01:06:22.050
you need to do to solve this.

01:06:22.050 --> 01:06:25.270
Which is at the RNA level,
the splicing enzymes

01:06:25.270 --> 01:06:28.560
would come along, and they would
snip out the part corresponding

01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:29.060
to here.

01:06:29.060 --> 01:06:30.470
And another would
snip out there.

01:06:30.470 --> 01:06:33.680
And another one as
an enzyme catalyzing

01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:35.600
would stick this
two pieces together.

01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:37.156
And thus you have this.

01:06:37.156 --> 01:06:39.540
This utterly bizarre
world in which

01:06:39.540 --> 01:06:41.940
genes, the vast
majority of them,

01:06:41.940 --> 01:06:45.200
are not coded for in a
continuous stretch of DNA

01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:48.220
but instead are broken up
into these separate exons.

01:06:48.220 --> 01:06:51.420
And then you need these
splicing enzymes to clip out

01:06:51.420 --> 01:06:53.742
the boring in-between
parts, the introns,

01:06:53.742 --> 01:06:55.200
stick them all
together, and you've

01:06:55.200 --> 01:06:56.990
got your functional gene.

01:06:56.990 --> 01:06:58.340
Weird.

01:06:58.340 --> 01:07:00.750
OK, but that's how
they work though.

01:07:00.750 --> 01:07:02.920
I know shortly after
these were discovered

01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:05.230
that one of the giants in
this business, guy named

01:07:05.230 --> 01:07:08.020
David Baltimore who got
the Nobel Prize for some

01:07:08.020 --> 01:07:11.280
of the work on that
reverse process of RNA

01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:13.730
viruses turning
back to DNA, he was

01:07:13.730 --> 01:07:16.950
the first to really appreciate
that what you've got here

01:07:16.950 --> 01:07:19.930
is a potential for a
lot of information.

01:07:19.930 --> 01:07:22.110
Because of, and I think
he was the first person

01:07:22.110 --> 01:07:24.950
to introduce this word into
thinking about it, because

01:07:24.950 --> 01:07:28.620
of the modular
construction of genes.

01:07:28.620 --> 01:07:33.910
Because genes come in
these separate exons.

01:07:33.910 --> 01:07:37.380
What does that begin
to allow you to do?

01:07:37.380 --> 01:07:41.530
Very important stuff.

01:07:56.490 --> 01:07:58.910
OK, so we have the
same structure here.

01:07:58.910 --> 01:08:02.190
And we have a gene coded
for in a modular way

01:08:02.190 --> 01:08:03.840
in three separate exons.

01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:08.070
And thanks to splicing enzymes,
protein catalysts clipping this

01:08:08.070 --> 01:08:10.200
out, you wind up with this.

01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:13.420
What Baltimore was the first or
one of the first to appreciate

01:08:13.420 --> 01:08:16.819
was that you could wind up
with something different

01:08:16.819 --> 01:08:18.229
there as well.

01:08:18.229 --> 01:08:21.910
You could, for example, create
a very different protein--

01:08:21.910 --> 01:08:25.970
one consisting only
of A and B. Or one

01:08:25.970 --> 01:08:29.490
consisting only of A and C.
Or one consisting of B and C,

01:08:29.490 --> 01:08:31.062
or A alone.

01:08:31.062 --> 01:08:35.870
And suddenly, you have this
combinatorial possibility

01:08:35.870 --> 01:08:40.529
of cranking out a number of
different ways of putting

01:08:40.529 --> 01:08:43.670
together-- seven different
ways since you can't transcribe

01:08:43.670 --> 01:08:46.120
this gene so that there's
no transcription-- seven

01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:49.569
different ways of combining
these different exons.

01:08:49.569 --> 01:08:51.850
Seven different
types of proteins

01:08:51.850 --> 01:08:55.350
you could generate
from the same gene.

01:08:55.350 --> 01:08:58.250
This was not accepted with
a whole lot of pleasure

01:08:58.250 --> 01:08:59.430
by the old guard.

01:08:59.430 --> 01:09:03.670
Because intrinsic in the know
the DNA sequence specifies

01:09:03.670 --> 01:09:06.050
amino acid, protein
shape, protein function,

01:09:06.050 --> 01:09:11.700
intrinsic in that is one
gene specifies one protein.

01:09:11.700 --> 01:09:15.050
One gene only specifies
a single protein.

01:09:15.050 --> 01:09:19.640
One protein is only specified,
coded for, by one gene.

01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:22.200
And suddenly, this
modular business

01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:26.460
allows you with one gene to
generate seven different kinds

01:09:26.460 --> 01:09:28.210
of proteins.

01:09:28.210 --> 01:09:31.359
For starters, how could that
possibly work that way just

01:09:31.359 --> 01:09:32.920
on a nuts and bolts level?

01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:35.770
All you need are
splicing enzymes

01:09:35.770 --> 01:09:37.670
that work a little
bit differently

01:09:37.670 --> 01:09:39.399
in different parts of the body.

01:09:39.399 --> 01:09:43.520
One that will splice
this off and is attached

01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:46.517
to an enzyme that
will degrade this,

01:09:46.517 --> 01:09:48.600
while the splicing enzyme
here-- and what have you

01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:49.520
just produced?

01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:50.810
You'll get this one.

01:09:50.810 --> 01:09:54.630
Coupling of splicing enzymes
with degradative enzymes,

01:09:54.630 --> 01:09:57.510
and suddenly you've
got a means to have

01:09:57.510 --> 01:10:01.340
tissue-specific
expression of genes.

01:10:01.340 --> 01:10:04.000
The same gene will
produce different types

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:07.120
of proteins in different
parts of the body

01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:10.930
because of splicing enzymes
working differently.

01:10:10.930 --> 01:10:13.690
Then, just to confuse
things even more,

01:10:13.690 --> 01:10:16.910
people began to note that there
would be some splicing enzymes

01:10:16.910 --> 01:10:21.010
and genes where they would
splice at a different point.

01:10:21.010 --> 01:10:25.150
And you would now have a
gene with A, and A prime,

01:10:25.150 --> 01:10:28.880
and other splicing enzymes
that would cut at other points.

01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:33.040
One single sequence of
DNA generating all sorts

01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:37.320
of different types of proteins
in different parts of the body,

01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:40.830
at different times of life,
under different circumstances,

01:10:40.830 --> 01:10:43.300
in different individuals
in different ways.

01:10:43.300 --> 01:10:47.100
Suddenly, there's a lot more
information floating around

01:10:47.100 --> 01:10:48.540
in there.

01:10:48.540 --> 01:10:52.220
So that was a huge, huge
breakthrough in the field,

01:10:52.220 --> 01:10:56.450
understanding this modular
basis of gene construction.

01:10:56.450 --> 01:10:58.700
And for our purposes
right now, what

01:10:58.700 --> 01:11:01.940
the most interesting consequence
of that is is it's no longer

01:11:01.940 --> 01:11:04.130
one gene, one protein.

01:11:04.130 --> 01:11:06.600
One gene instead can
generate all sorts

01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:09.020
of different types of
proteins, different settings,

01:11:09.020 --> 01:11:12.070
different circumstances.

01:11:12.070 --> 01:11:14.640
The next thing that was
intrinsic in this model that's

01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:17.750
now been trashed of one
continuous gene, one

01:11:17.750 --> 01:11:20.780
continuous gene-- what we just
figured out that instead you

01:11:20.780 --> 01:11:22.600
can have the introns,
exons, all of that.

01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:26.050
The next thing that went down
the tubes was looking at, Well,

01:11:26.050 --> 01:11:29.160
how much of DNA is
actually devoted

01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:32.610
to coding for amino acids?

01:11:32.610 --> 01:11:36.170
And the answer was
obvious, like 99.9% each.

01:11:36.170 --> 01:11:38.950
One of these would just have
to have a stop codon, a stop

01:11:38.950 --> 01:11:39.940
signal at the end.

01:11:39.940 --> 01:11:43.890
And otherwise, this was just a
continuous flow of information

01:11:43.890 --> 01:11:47.070
once you have factored
in these interim things.

01:11:47.070 --> 01:11:49.010
OK, so they're
part of this gene,

01:11:49.010 --> 01:11:51.240
but immediately
starts the next one.

01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:54.020
The next major
discovery was one gene

01:11:54.020 --> 01:11:58.020
would very rarely start
immediately after the next one.

01:11:58.020 --> 01:12:01.680
There would be long
stretches of DNA in between

01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:08.630
that didn't code for a
protein-- non-coding DNA.

01:12:08.630 --> 01:12:11.341
That's mighty puzzling.

01:12:11.341 --> 01:12:11.840
What's that?

01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:13.340
Just junk or stuff?

01:12:13.340 --> 01:12:15.770
And around that time,
the phrase junk DNA

01:12:15.770 --> 01:12:17.300
was actually floating around.

01:12:17.300 --> 01:12:18.970
People trying to
make sense of this.

01:12:18.970 --> 01:12:20.890
And when people sat
and started actually

01:12:20.890 --> 01:12:23.690
like doing the numbers,
out came a number

01:12:23.690 --> 01:12:27.750
that knocked people on their
rears it was so flabbergasting.

01:12:27.750 --> 01:12:33.520
95% of DNA is non-coding.

01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:40.790
95% does not code for a
gene specifying a protein.

01:12:40.790 --> 01:12:43.840
In other words, in between
here on the average

01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:47.920
would be a stretch of DNA
19 times the length of that,

01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:49.700
or whatever the
math winds up being.

01:12:49.700 --> 01:12:53.690
And suddenly calling that stuff
junk DNA starting to see me

01:12:53.690 --> 01:12:56.720
a little bit tenuous,
because 95% your DNA

01:12:56.720 --> 01:12:59.640
just can't be packing
material for the whole thing.

01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:01.710
It's got to be doing something.

01:13:01.710 --> 01:13:05.740
And during that period,
became sort of the insight

01:13:05.740 --> 01:13:10.040
into this that all the
intervening, non-coding stuff

01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:11.630
was-- what was that?

01:13:11.630 --> 01:13:13.990
That was the
instruction booklet.

01:13:13.990 --> 01:13:16.850
That was the instruction
booklet on when

01:13:16.850 --> 01:13:19.310
to activate these genes.

01:13:19.310 --> 01:13:25.660
That was the on and off switches
for turning genes on or off.

01:13:25.660 --> 01:13:28.490
Upstream in the
non-coding domain

01:13:28.490 --> 01:13:31.090
just above a particular
gene sequence

01:13:31.090 --> 01:13:35.780
would be the information for
when that gene is activated.

01:13:35.780 --> 01:13:39.230
Activated when it makes RNA
into protein, all of that.

01:13:39.230 --> 01:13:44.130
And upstream of that are
the on and off switches.

01:13:44.130 --> 01:13:49.580
Implication right there off the
bat, which is Crick was wrong.

01:13:49.580 --> 01:13:53.710
DNA sequences are not
the starting point

01:13:53.710 --> 01:13:55.680
of the central dogma of life.

01:13:55.680 --> 01:13:59.010
And DNA is the rule-giver
and all of that.

01:13:59.010 --> 01:14:00.820
DNA is being regulated.

01:14:00.820 --> 01:14:03.760
Genes are being regulated
in some other way.

01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:06.460
And where 95% of
DNA is being devoted

01:14:06.460 --> 01:14:09.640
to regulation of the genes.

01:14:09.640 --> 01:14:11.970
DNA has no idea what it's doing.

01:14:11.970 --> 01:14:15.170
DNA is a readout that's
under the control

01:14:15.170 --> 01:14:17.890
of all sorts of other factors.

01:14:17.890 --> 01:14:21.710
And out of this emerged the
really, really important

01:14:21.710 --> 01:14:30.460
concepts of regulatory
sequences upstream from genes.

01:14:30.460 --> 01:14:36.890
So here we have a long string of
DNA coding for this gene which

01:14:36.890 --> 01:14:38.680
happens to come in two exons.

01:14:38.680 --> 01:14:42.090
And it is like the
space between the galaxy

01:14:42.090 --> 01:14:45.400
how long the non-coding is going
to go on until the next gene is

01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:46.380
back there.

01:14:46.380 --> 01:14:48.120
So what's going
on in the stretch

01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:50.280
just upstream from this gene?

01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:52.340
Things that were
soon being called

01:14:52.340 --> 01:14:57.590
stuff like promoter sequences
or repressor sequences.

01:14:57.590 --> 01:15:02.400
Things, stretches of DNA,
that coded for switches

01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:04.950
rather than coding for protein.

01:15:04.950 --> 01:15:09.420
That coded for things
coming into the neighborhood

01:15:09.420 --> 01:15:14.580
of the DNA and binding to some
of these promoter or repressor

01:15:14.580 --> 01:15:19.470
sequences, and then turning
on, or in some cases off,

01:15:19.470 --> 01:15:22.620
the transcription of that
gene, the process of the gene

01:15:22.620 --> 01:15:24.340
generating proteins.

01:15:24.340 --> 01:15:27.520
You would have
promoters sitting there.

01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:30.300
And this is overly literal.

01:15:30.300 --> 01:15:32.774
It would be just
a sequence of DNA,

01:15:32.774 --> 01:15:34.440
which thanks to that
sequence would have

01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:36.830
a certain subtle microshape.

01:15:36.830 --> 01:15:39.150
And along would
come something which

01:15:39.150 --> 01:15:42.820
happened to be able to fit
perfectly into that spot.

01:15:42.820 --> 01:15:47.240
And if, and only if, this
molecule-- usually a protein--

01:15:47.240 --> 01:15:50.890
bound to this
promoter, suddenly that

01:15:50.890 --> 01:15:53.370
would trigger a whole
bunch of enzymes

01:15:53.370 --> 01:15:56.590
to come in, which would start
the process of transcribing

01:15:56.590 --> 01:15:58.190
this gene.

01:15:58.190 --> 01:16:00.810
This would be the switch,
and this is the thing

01:16:00.810 --> 01:16:03.140
that just turned the switch on.

01:16:03.140 --> 01:16:07.010
And these things that turn
these switches on, or off

01:16:07.010 --> 01:16:12.260
in some cases, were soon
called transcription factors.

01:16:12.260 --> 01:16:15.470
Totally critical concept
in there-- the fact

01:16:15.470 --> 01:16:19.030
that vast stretches of DNA
don't code for anything.

01:16:19.030 --> 01:16:22.000
Instead, they have the
instruction booklets.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.450
Here's how you turn
this gene on or off.

01:16:24.450 --> 01:16:27.430
Send in this
molecular messenger.

01:16:27.430 --> 01:16:30.520
Send in this type of
transcription factor.

01:16:30.520 --> 01:16:33.030
And if it shows
up, binds to here,

01:16:33.030 --> 01:16:35.550
you now activate
the transcription

01:16:35.550 --> 01:16:37.980
of this gene, the process
of turning that gene,

01:16:37.980 --> 01:16:40.190
making proteins derived from it.

01:16:40.190 --> 01:16:43.200
This is where the
information was.

01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:45.940
And this is not DNA
knowing what it's doing.

01:16:45.940 --> 01:16:50.200
This is outside
regulators coming in.

01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:52.440
So immediately,
that has made life

01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:54.590
a whole lot more complicated.

01:16:54.590 --> 01:16:58.290
Next complications-- you
could have different genes

01:16:58.290 --> 01:17:00.340
scattered all over
the place that

01:17:00.340 --> 01:17:04.290
would have the same
promoter upstream of it.

01:17:04.290 --> 01:17:05.860
What would that mean?

01:17:05.860 --> 01:17:08.450
In comes a transcription
factor, and it

01:17:08.450 --> 01:17:11.260
doesn't activate the
transcription of one

01:17:11.260 --> 01:17:12.820
gene producing one protein.

01:17:12.820 --> 01:17:16.930
It activates the transcription
of a whole bunch of them.

01:17:16.930 --> 01:17:20.560
In other words, now
suddenly we have messengers

01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:26.850
that could trigger activation of
genetic networks, entire arrays

01:17:26.850 --> 01:17:31.412
of proteins being produced all
with a functional similarity

01:17:31.412 --> 01:17:32.870
driven by the fact
that all of them

01:17:32.870 --> 01:17:34.970
have the same promoter upstream.

01:17:34.970 --> 01:17:37.820
So suddenly, you
have the possibility

01:17:37.820 --> 01:17:40.550
of the same promoter
being upstream

01:17:40.550 --> 01:17:42.960
regulating more than one gene.

01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:44.820
That is the general rule.

01:17:44.820 --> 01:17:49.430
Flip side of it, any
given gene, for example,

01:17:49.430 --> 01:17:52.950
could have a bunch of
different promoters responding

01:17:52.950 --> 01:17:55.210
to different types of signals.

01:17:55.210 --> 01:17:58.300
So now, suddenly,
you have this gene

01:17:58.300 --> 01:18:01.670
which can be transcribed
under this circumstance,

01:18:01.670 --> 01:18:04.870
or under this circumstance.

01:18:04.870 --> 01:18:08.770
And both are ways of turning
on activation of that gene.

01:18:08.770 --> 01:18:11.460
And in this circumstance,
the same promoter

01:18:11.460 --> 01:18:14.840
is found in Genes A, B, and
C somewhere at the other end

01:18:14.840 --> 01:18:15.970
of the chromosome.

01:18:15.970 --> 01:18:17.550
And in this case,
this promoter is

01:18:17.550 --> 01:18:22.810
found on Genes D, E, and F down
there-- different networks.

01:18:22.810 --> 01:18:26.130
So the same sort of
transcription factor logic--

01:18:26.130 --> 01:18:31.080
once you can have different
promoters upstream of a gene,

01:18:31.080 --> 01:18:33.760
and once you can have the
same promoter upstream

01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:36.730
for multiple genes, you
suddenly have the ability

01:18:36.730 --> 01:18:38.750
with different
transcription factors

01:18:38.750 --> 01:18:44.260
to activate entire networks
of gene expression.

01:18:44.260 --> 01:18:45.010
OK.

01:18:45.010 --> 01:18:46.850
So what this has
allowed you to do

01:18:46.850 --> 01:18:50.780
is completely trash this notion
of DNA knows what it's doing.

01:18:50.780 --> 01:18:52.820
DNA is just the readout.

01:18:52.820 --> 01:18:54.870
And who knows what's going on?

01:18:54.870 --> 01:18:57.910
Whatever is controlling
the transcription factors.

01:18:57.910 --> 01:19:01.670
Whatever is causing
them to do their thing.

01:19:01.670 --> 01:19:04.900
And this could be a
world of influences.

01:19:04.900 --> 01:19:07.600
And to be absolutely
accurate, this

01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:11.420
requires introducing
the word environment.

01:19:11.420 --> 01:19:13.840
This is environment
having something

01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:16.050
to do with genetic effects.

01:19:16.050 --> 01:19:19.040
This is going to be a
way in which environment

01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:23.300
is interacting with genetic
elements, environment

01:19:23.300 --> 01:19:26.162
determining which of
these are doing what.

01:19:26.162 --> 01:19:27.670
What would that look like?

01:19:27.670 --> 01:19:30.620
Sometimes environment
could be the environment

01:19:30.620 --> 01:19:32.950
in the rest of this cell.

01:19:32.950 --> 01:19:37.810
So you've got your DNA
there, and your structures,

01:19:37.810 --> 01:19:39.760
and all of that,
and the promoter.

01:19:39.760 --> 01:19:41.180
And we could do that by now.

01:19:41.180 --> 01:19:45.390
And something is occurring
inside the cell which activates

01:19:45.390 --> 01:19:47.030
some transcription factor.

01:19:47.030 --> 01:19:51.980
And then you go change a
genetic event going on in there.

01:19:51.980 --> 01:19:54.600
The cell is running
out of energy.

01:19:54.600 --> 01:19:57.670
There's various ways
to construct sensors.

01:19:57.670 --> 01:19:59.490
In other words,
evolution has come up

01:19:59.490 --> 01:20:02.450
with a bunch of different ways
in which cells can respond

01:20:02.450 --> 01:20:04.960
to signals of low
energy, and that

01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:08.300
will activate some transcription
factor which will go

01:20:08.300 --> 01:20:12.200
and bind to a bunch of promoters
which produce proteins involved

01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:16.620
in taking up more energy from
outside the cell, transporting

01:20:16.620 --> 01:20:19.040
in more, using energy
more efficiently.

01:20:19.040 --> 01:20:22.550
So what we have here is an
environmental regulation

01:20:22.550 --> 01:20:23.950
of genetic effects.

01:20:23.950 --> 01:20:28.030
Environment-- the rest of
the environment of the cell.

01:20:28.030 --> 01:20:29.870
The DNA doesn't know
what it's doing.

01:20:29.870 --> 01:20:31.660
The gene doesn't
know what it's doing.

01:20:31.660 --> 01:20:34.120
Events going on
elsewhere in the cell

01:20:34.120 --> 01:20:36.600
is what's regulating what's up.

01:20:36.600 --> 01:20:38.920
Some of the time,
the environment

01:20:38.920 --> 01:20:45.000
can be even more far flung.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.710
And in this case, it's
now events going on

01:20:47.710 --> 01:20:51.370
outside just this one cell.

01:20:51.370 --> 01:20:55.380
In this case now, you've
got the cell with it's DNA.

01:20:55.380 --> 01:20:58.890
And now, instead, you
have a chemical messenger

01:20:58.890 --> 01:21:01.440
coming from somewhere else.

01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:04.580
And binds to its receptor
like a lock and key.

01:21:04.580 --> 01:21:07.030
And as a result of
this binding, something

01:21:07.030 --> 01:21:08.909
happens here, which
does something here,

01:21:08.909 --> 01:21:10.700
which does something
here, which eventually

01:21:10.700 --> 01:21:14.130
activates some transcription
factor, which goes and does

01:21:14.130 --> 01:21:15.410
its thing.

01:21:15.410 --> 01:21:19.500
Now we have gene expression
in the cell being regulated

01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:23.200
by the environment
somewhere else in the body,

01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:24.430
somewhere else there.

01:21:24.430 --> 01:21:26.640
What would be a classic
example of that?

01:21:26.640 --> 01:21:28.650
This is what a whole
lot hormones do.

01:21:28.650 --> 01:21:30.370
Hormones go floating around.

01:21:30.370 --> 01:21:33.150
And they affect cells
everywhere throughout the body.

01:21:33.150 --> 01:21:38.040
By definition, a hormone is a
bloodborne chemical messenger.

01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:40.390
So you could secrete
some hormone out

01:21:40.390 --> 01:21:42.570
of the top of your ear,
and it will affect things

01:21:42.570 --> 01:21:43.800
in your little toe.

01:21:43.800 --> 01:21:45.420
Very far flung.

01:21:45.420 --> 01:21:48.980
Hormones will bind to their
receptors, lock and key.

01:21:48.980 --> 01:21:51.550
Most hormones are
protein in nature,

01:21:51.550 --> 01:21:56.200
and trigger what's called
a second messenger cascade.

01:21:56.200 --> 01:21:57.930
Jargon, don't worry about it.

01:21:57.930 --> 01:21:59.450
Just get it conceptually.

01:21:59.450 --> 01:22:01.740
Activate some
transcription factor,

01:22:01.740 --> 01:22:03.540
deactivate some other
transcription factor.

01:22:03.540 --> 01:22:08.190
And suddenly, events going
on 14 counties over there

01:22:08.190 --> 01:22:12.020
are regulating what proteins
are being made in this cell.

01:22:12.020 --> 01:22:13.990
What would be an
example of that?

01:22:13.990 --> 01:22:15.850
Testosterone, for example.

01:22:15.850 --> 01:22:17.970
Testosterone secreted
from the testes,

01:22:17.970 --> 01:22:21.710
traveling far and wide and
eventually binding to androgen

01:22:21.710 --> 01:22:24.150
receptors on muscle.

01:22:24.150 --> 01:22:27.180
And what happens there is
through a pathway like this,

01:22:27.180 --> 01:22:30.450
turning on the activation of
genes, coding for proteins,

01:22:30.450 --> 01:22:33.200
all sorts of structural
proteins that will

01:22:33.200 --> 01:22:35.260
make that muscle cell bigger.

01:22:35.260 --> 01:22:38.560
Your muscles are getting
bigger thanks to testosterone.

01:22:38.560 --> 01:22:39.440
Look at this.

01:22:39.440 --> 01:22:43.150
Events occurring a gazillion
cells away in the testes,

01:22:43.150 --> 01:22:46.960
a messenger here, determining
what gene expression,

01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:49.850
what gene activation
is happening.

01:22:49.850 --> 01:22:52.350
Sometimes, though,
the environment

01:22:52.350 --> 01:22:57.855
could be completely
outside the organism.

01:23:02.160 --> 01:23:03.600
Like that.

01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:07.530
Sometimes you can have,
for example, a messenger

01:23:07.530 --> 01:23:09.180
from the outside world.

01:23:09.180 --> 01:23:10.570
What sort of messenger?

01:23:10.570 --> 01:23:12.210
A scary sight.

01:23:12.210 --> 01:23:14.900
A bit of sensory
information or whatever.

01:23:14.900 --> 01:23:16.540
Olfactory.

01:23:16.540 --> 01:23:20.160
Olfactory-- suppose
some odorant comes in.

01:23:20.160 --> 01:23:24.400
A pheromone-- you're female rat
who has recently given birth,

01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:27.040
and the pheromones
from your babies

01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:31.760
come floating in and
bind to receptors here.

01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:33.680
Very similar principle, again.

01:23:33.680 --> 01:23:36.350
And that causes them to activate
something, activate something,

01:23:36.350 --> 01:23:37.530
and some cell down there.

01:23:37.530 --> 01:23:39.890
And eventually
there is a cell here

01:23:39.890 --> 01:23:42.190
that controls some
muscles, and it

01:23:42.190 --> 01:23:44.560
makes your eyes
dilate because you

01:23:44.560 --> 01:23:46.487
love the smell of your baby.

01:23:46.487 --> 01:23:49.070
And you're just-- I don't know
if rats have their eyes dilate.

01:23:49.070 --> 01:23:52.820
But humans will in many
other circumstances.

01:23:52.820 --> 01:23:54.660
Aha, how do you do that?

01:23:54.660 --> 01:23:58.030
You just changed some structural
proteins that did this or that.

01:23:58.030 --> 01:24:01.610
Or suddenly this
female is making

01:24:01.610 --> 01:24:05.170
some hormone like oxytocin as
a result of smelling her baby.

01:24:05.170 --> 01:24:06.370
What have we got here?

01:24:06.370 --> 01:24:10.560
We got something going on in
the outside world regulating

01:24:10.560 --> 01:24:12.430
what's going on with the genes.

01:24:12.430 --> 01:24:15.730
Genes as the central
dogma of life,

01:24:15.730 --> 01:24:18.800
as the information
giver-- nonsense.

01:24:18.800 --> 01:24:21.000
Events going on in
the rest of the cell,

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.410
the rest of the organism,
the rest of the universe,

01:24:23.410 --> 01:24:26.340
are determining
when genes activate.

01:24:26.340 --> 01:24:30.540
So what we see now is a
much more interesting world

01:24:30.540 --> 01:24:33.560
of regulation of
gene expression.

01:24:33.560 --> 01:24:37.700
First, the modular
ability for one gene

01:24:37.700 --> 01:24:40.750
to generate all sorts of
different proteins, which

01:24:40.750 --> 01:24:42.930
brings up an issue after
a while is, does that

01:24:42.930 --> 01:24:44.040
count as one gene?

01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:45.940
And people argue over that.

01:24:45.940 --> 01:24:50.560
And because of this 95%
regulatory sequence business,

01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:54.560
the most interesting
stuff going on with DNA

01:24:54.560 --> 01:25:00.080
is not what the protein is
like, not what the protein does,

01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:02.350
not how well the
protein does it,

01:25:02.350 --> 01:25:06.570
but when it does it,
in what contexts.

01:25:06.570 --> 01:25:10.870
And what we've just
introduced are if then clauses

01:25:10.870 --> 01:25:12.620
into this whole world.

01:25:12.620 --> 01:25:17.010
If you get a signal that there
is low glucose in the cell,

01:25:17.010 --> 01:25:21.130
then you begin to make proteins
related to glucose uptake.

01:25:21.130 --> 01:25:24.640
If you have the smell
of your child come in,

01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:26.680
then you activate
this [? path. ?]

01:25:26.680 --> 01:25:29.560
It's not changing what
the protein is like.

01:25:29.560 --> 01:25:31.430
It's changing context.

01:25:31.430 --> 01:25:34.910
And I think what we will see
is context is vastly more

01:25:34.910 --> 01:25:37.780
interesting than whether this
protein is a little bit more

01:25:37.780 --> 01:25:39.510
like this, a little
bit more like that.

01:25:39.510 --> 01:25:42.650
If it is being expressed
instead at a different time,

01:25:42.650 --> 01:25:45.620
in a different place,
in a different context,

01:25:45.620 --> 01:25:48.160
that's much more interesting.

01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:50.760
So what does that
set us up for here?

01:25:50.760 --> 01:25:53.200
Now beginning to see the
organization of this.

01:25:53.200 --> 01:25:56.170
By the way-- 95%,
this whole stuff here.

01:25:56.170 --> 01:25:58.050
I don't know what
percentage is accounted

01:25:58.050 --> 01:26:01.830
for by identified promoters,
and repressors, and stuff.

01:26:01.830 --> 01:26:03.760
But it's a tiny percentage.

01:26:03.760 --> 01:26:06.800
What that means is there's
regulatory stuff going on

01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:08.500
that no one has a clue about.

01:26:08.500 --> 01:26:12.690
The main thing, though,
here is modulatory structure

01:26:12.690 --> 01:26:16.650
to genes-- introns, exons--
and this whole world

01:26:16.650 --> 01:26:18.940
of the environment
regulating when

01:26:18.940 --> 01:26:21.080
genes are turned on and off.

01:26:21.080 --> 01:26:23.410
A whole world where
you could generate

01:26:23.410 --> 01:26:25.730
completely different proteins.

01:26:25.730 --> 01:26:27.730
Not a protein that's a
little bit more this way,

01:26:27.730 --> 01:26:32.850
a little bit more that way, in
completely different contexts.

01:26:32.850 --> 01:26:34.720
So all we need to
do now is begin

01:26:34.720 --> 01:26:39.740
to stick this into the
molecular biology of mutations

01:26:39.740 --> 01:26:42.090
and evolutionary change.

01:26:42.090 --> 01:26:45.650
Where does this begin?

01:26:45.650 --> 01:26:47.440
Oh, no, before we
do that, that's not

01:26:47.440 --> 01:26:48.400
what we're going to do.

01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:51.450
We're going to look at one
more level of regulation here.

01:26:51.450 --> 01:26:55.820
OK, so you've got your DNA.

01:26:55.820 --> 01:26:58.050
And we already know
this whole business.

01:26:58.050 --> 01:26:59.906
What's telling it what to do.

01:26:59.906 --> 01:27:02.720
You can have transcription
factors coming in,

01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:05.220
all of that, these
interesting implications.

01:27:05.220 --> 01:27:06.870
DNA-- let's see.

01:27:06.870 --> 01:27:13.190
For our purposes, protected
in sort of layers of protein

01:27:13.190 --> 01:27:15.820
that are just sort of
structurally stabilizing.

01:27:15.820 --> 01:27:18.140
This is not really what
they look like or quite

01:27:18.140 --> 01:27:21.190
what they're made of, but
they're called chromatin.

01:27:21.190 --> 01:27:23.870
There's this stuff that
stabilizes the DNA.

01:27:23.870 --> 01:27:26.370
Because these are
wispy little things.

01:27:26.370 --> 01:27:28.860
And one of the things that,
of course, they need to do

01:27:28.860 --> 01:27:32.170
is they're in wrapped
around the DNA stabilizing.

01:27:32.170 --> 01:27:34.920
You've got some transcription
factor coming in from somewhere

01:27:34.920 --> 01:27:35.990
else in the cell.

01:27:35.990 --> 01:27:39.970
It's got to be able to
get down to the DNA.

01:27:39.970 --> 01:27:44.240
And thus, you have a whole
world of chomatin opening up

01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:47.710
to allow transcription
factors to get through.

01:27:47.710 --> 01:27:51.430
And thus, you have a whole world
of what's telling the chromatin

01:27:51.430 --> 01:27:53.660
to open up where and when?

01:27:53.660 --> 01:27:57.620
Suddenly, a whole
world of regulation,

01:27:57.620 --> 01:27:59.340
of whether the
transcription factors

01:27:59.340 --> 01:28:02.610
even have access to the DNA.

01:28:02.610 --> 01:28:05.990
So you can have tons of
a transcription factor,

01:28:05.990 --> 01:28:08.770
and all set to transcribe
something off of this.

01:28:08.770 --> 01:28:13.710
And thanks to conformational
changes, folding or unfolding

01:28:13.710 --> 01:28:16.490
of chromatin, you're regulating
whether the transcription

01:28:16.490 --> 01:28:18.510
factor can even get through.

01:28:18.510 --> 01:28:20.680
And thus, there's a
whole world of stuff

01:28:20.680 --> 01:28:24.720
that changes chromatin
modeling and remodeling.

01:28:24.720 --> 01:28:28.460
Additional step here, one
that's really interesting,

01:28:28.460 --> 01:28:31.510
is you can do things--
circumstances [? arise, ?]

01:28:31.510 --> 01:28:34.280
the environment can do
things-- where you change

01:28:34.280 --> 01:28:39.200
the structure of chromatin
around a particular gene

01:28:39.200 --> 01:28:41.230
in a way that makes it
easier to transcribe,

01:28:41.230 --> 01:28:42.500
or harder to transcribe.

01:28:42.500 --> 01:28:45.980
And you can essentially
make that change permanent.

01:28:45.980 --> 01:28:48.360
You could permanently
do something

01:28:48.360 --> 01:28:50.660
in some particular
stretch of chromatin

01:28:50.660 --> 01:28:53.840
so it will never open up again
to allow the transcription

01:28:53.840 --> 01:28:55.670
factor in.

01:28:55.670 --> 01:28:57.710
And what you have
just done-- jargon--

01:28:57.710 --> 01:29:01.710
is you have silenced that gene.

01:29:01.710 --> 01:29:04.520
You've silenced it permanently.

01:29:04.520 --> 01:29:08.180
And people know a lot of the
mechanisms for how this occurs.

01:29:08.180 --> 01:29:09.910
For those who care
about such things,

01:29:09.910 --> 01:29:11.769
the process is
called methylation.

01:29:11.769 --> 01:29:13.060
This is a little bit different.

01:29:13.060 --> 01:29:14.780
That's occurring
with the DNA itself.

01:29:14.780 --> 01:29:19.470
But this is silencing of
genes by structural access

01:29:19.470 --> 01:29:22.150
of transcription factors to it.

01:29:22.150 --> 01:29:23.840
When does that occur?

01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:27.310
There's all sorts of
circumstances early in life

01:29:27.310 --> 01:29:30.910
where you will change the
permanent accessibility

01:29:30.910 --> 01:29:34.370
of some gene and
transcription factors.

01:29:34.370 --> 01:29:37.930
You will cause long-term,
lifelong changes.

01:29:37.930 --> 01:29:39.610
As but one example,
and one that we

01:29:39.610 --> 01:29:42.600
will look at a number of
times down the pike there,

01:29:42.600 --> 01:29:47.230
in rats, the mothering
style of the mother rats,

01:29:47.230 --> 01:29:51.270
will cause chromatin
changes-- permanent ones--

01:29:51.270 --> 01:29:54.580
in some of the genes
related to stress hormones.

01:29:54.580 --> 01:29:57.180
So that certain types of
mothering-- how often you

01:29:57.180 --> 01:30:00.370
lick the baby, and other
rat mother type stuff--

01:30:00.370 --> 01:30:04.000
will regulate how readily
some genes will be turned

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.360
on for the rest of your life.

01:30:06.360 --> 01:30:08.310
This is early experience.

01:30:08.310 --> 01:30:12.390
This is molecular mechanisms
for events early in life

01:30:12.390 --> 01:30:13.870
lasting forever.

01:30:13.870 --> 01:30:16.120
A lot of these turn out to
be a little bit reversible.

01:30:16.120 --> 01:30:18.530
But for our purposes,
lasting forever.

01:30:18.530 --> 01:30:22.930
This is a whole new
field called epigenetics.

01:30:22.930 --> 01:30:26.370
Genetics is all
about DNA sequences.

01:30:26.370 --> 01:30:30.300
Epigenetics is all
about regulation

01:30:30.300 --> 01:30:34.330
of access to DNA sequences,
things of that sort.

01:30:34.330 --> 01:30:37.030
So suddenly this
epigenetic world

01:30:37.030 --> 01:30:41.240
is entirely capable of
overriding anything going on

01:30:41.240 --> 01:30:43.532
at the transcription factor end.

01:30:43.532 --> 01:30:45.795
Just to give you a sense
of this-- researcher.

01:30:45.795 --> 01:30:47.920
This is a guy at the National
Institute of Health--

01:30:47.920 --> 01:30:50.640
a guy named Steve
Sumi who studies

01:30:50.640 --> 01:30:52.360
primate social behavior.

01:30:52.360 --> 01:30:55.980
And what he has
shown is in monkeys,

01:30:55.980 --> 01:30:59.850
in one part of their
brain, you change the style

01:30:59.850 --> 01:31:03.090
of mothering that that monkey
is subject to as a baby,

01:31:03.090 --> 01:31:06.650
and you will change the
conformational access

01:31:06.650 --> 01:31:10.720
state of 4,000 different genes.

01:31:10.720 --> 01:31:13.610
Enormously influential there.

01:31:13.610 --> 01:31:18.350
Enormous arrays of ways of
regulating where it's not

01:31:18.350 --> 01:31:21.290
genetics, it's epigenetics.

01:31:21.290 --> 01:31:25.250
And this has given rise to a
great phrase-- fertilization

01:31:25.250 --> 01:31:27.590
is all about genetics.

01:31:27.590 --> 01:31:30.930
Development is all
about epigenetics.

01:31:30.930 --> 01:31:33.120
And what epigenetics
is about are

01:31:33.120 --> 01:31:37.100
ways in which the environment
not only can regulate what's

01:31:37.100 --> 01:31:38.840
going on with this
gene right now,

01:31:38.840 --> 01:31:42.350
but can cause lifelong
differences in the ability

01:31:42.350 --> 01:31:45.130
to access genes.

01:31:45.130 --> 01:31:49.240
So this is an enormous array
of levels of regulation.

01:31:49.240 --> 01:31:52.110
Splicing enzymes
determining how your exons

01:31:52.110 --> 01:31:54.030
get mixed and matched,
generating all sorts

01:31:54.030 --> 01:31:55.260
of different proteins.

01:31:55.260 --> 01:31:58.130
Transcription factors
representing the things

01:31:58.130 --> 01:32:01.550
that turn the switches on and
off, and the array of switches

01:32:01.550 --> 01:32:04.860
is far more interesting and
plentiful than the gene itself.

01:32:04.860 --> 01:32:06.850
Transcription factors
reflecting what's

01:32:06.850 --> 01:32:10.550
going on in the outside world,
like in the rest of the cell

01:32:10.550 --> 01:32:12.290
to the other side of the planet.

01:32:12.290 --> 01:32:15.160
And finally, this
whole additional level

01:32:15.160 --> 01:32:19.230
of regulation where some of
the regulatory consequences

01:32:19.230 --> 01:32:20.940
here can be lifelong.

01:32:20.940 --> 01:32:24.350
Enormous array of
levels of regulation.

01:32:24.350 --> 01:32:26.890
And an enormous number
of ways in which

01:32:26.890 --> 01:32:29.200
just the DNA sequence
of the gene itself

01:32:29.200 --> 01:32:31.380
is not very interesting.

01:32:31.380 --> 01:32:34.100
That determines the
shape of the protein.

01:32:34.100 --> 01:32:36.340
All this other
stuff is where is it

01:32:36.340 --> 01:32:38.430
expressed, when is
it expressed, in what

01:32:38.430 --> 01:32:41.550
contexts, what sort of
if then contingencies,

01:32:41.550 --> 01:32:45.210
whether it is ever expressed
after a certain childhood

01:32:45.210 --> 01:32:45.810
event.

01:32:45.810 --> 01:32:49.810
All of that much much
more interesting.

01:32:49.810 --> 01:32:53.710
So what we need to
do now is transition

01:32:53.710 --> 01:32:57.510
to thinking about
evolution, mutations,

01:32:57.510 --> 01:33:00.310
on the level of all the
stuff we just heard about.

01:33:00.310 --> 01:33:03.790
And all I will leave you with
and picking up on Wednesday,

01:33:03.790 --> 01:33:09.820
is think about what if you get
a mutation in a splicing enzyme?

01:33:09.820 --> 01:33:13.810
What if you get a mutation
in a transcription factor?

01:33:13.810 --> 01:33:17.340
What if you get a mutation
not in the letters

01:33:17.340 --> 01:33:21.000
coding for a gene, but
coding for a promoter?

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.320
What happens in all those cases?

01:33:23.320 --> 01:33:26.010
And suddenly you
begin to see a world

01:33:26.010 --> 01:33:30.130
in which you can get stuff
that's not purely gradual.

01:33:30.130 --> 01:33:33.380

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:05.855
Stanford University.

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:13.630
Let's see.

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:15.530
Various announcements.

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.734
I am out of town tomorrow,
so no office hours.

00:00:18.734 --> 00:00:22.380
I managed effortlessly to
confuse a whole bunch of people

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.810
Monday about positive selection
versus stabilizing selection.

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.735
All of that on the Q&amp;A
part of the course works.

00:00:30.735 --> 00:00:33.370
I've pulled out the paragraphs
from the extended readings

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.783
that explain that coherently, as
opposed to what happened here.

00:00:36.783 --> 00:00:40.170
And Monday-- Monday I discovered
that somebody sitting in this

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.040
room, who I cannot
spot at the moment,

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.600
has a spectacular tattoo
illustrating the central dogma

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.360
of life, or at least one person.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.870
If there's two, it's
really something.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.200
So amazing demonstration
of DNA to RNA to protein.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.640
So if the person doesn't
have a class afterward,

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.050
he will be standing up
on top of this counter

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.680
here displaying
it for everybody's

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.599
educational purposes.

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:08.240
So besides finding about that
guy, what else happened Monday?

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.190
Monday we introduced
two concepts

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:14.430
and, with great
dramatic foreshadowing,

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.220
started to trash both.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.750
The first one being
this huge emphasis

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.580
in all of the preceding lectures
on the evolution of behavior--

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.410
not only this emphasis
on adaptation,

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.900
not only this emphasis on
inferring a genetic basis

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.370
through that roundabout--
here's a story

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.700
and until you make up
a better one, I win.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.780
But also that emphasis
on gradualism,

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.220
that slow evolutionary change.

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.560
What we focused
on there was what

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.720
would be the mechanisms,
the molecular mechanisms,

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.300
for classic gradualist
evolutionary change,

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.910
microevolution, the whole world
of point mutations-- deletion,

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.660
insertion, all of that, the
whole world of mutations

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.462
potentially being big news,
knocking a protein completely

00:02:01.462 --> 00:02:02.920
out of business
and suddenly you've

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.290
got a different gender than
you actually are chromosomally,

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.940
but a world, none the less,
where for our soundbite,

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.660
micromutations are affecting
how readily a protein does

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.930
its job-- how strongly,
how potently, how long,

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.610
what its job is,
all of that, that

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.600
as sort of the grist for the
microevolutionary change.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.490
What we then transitioned
to was the huge, huge attack

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.650
on the gradualism that
came with this view

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.030
of punctuated
equilibrium, this notion

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.160
that most of the time, nothing
exciting was happening,

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.660
long periods of stasis, and
then sudden, dramatic change

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.580
proposed by Gould, other
evolutionary people.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.360
And what we saw was
the huge implication.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.220
There it was.

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.490
If most of the time,
nothing interesting

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.650
is happening in terms
of evolutionary shift,

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.500
there goes
gradualism, there goes

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.480
the emphasis of every
bit of adaptation

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.990
is going to make a difference
long term, every, opportunity

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:01.430
to compete, compete
and dominate,

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:02.680
is going to make a difference.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.370
All of that goes down the
drain if 99% of the time,

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.460
there is instead
equilibrium stasis.

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.140
What we saw were the wildly
enthused attacks upon it

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.790
along the grounds of that
stasis and rapid change

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.220
for paleontologists
bears no resemblance

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.450
to what the world is like for
an evolutionary biologist.

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.880
Paleontologists can only see
the evolution of boring stuff--

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:26.990
morphology.

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:29.840
You miss the entire
world of what's going on

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.540
inside that morphology.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.020
And the most damning
sort of complaint,

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.220
show me some
molecular mechanisms

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.790
for these
macroevolutionary changes.

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.420
What we then transitioned
to was seeing all the ways

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.450
in which the picture of the
structure of genes and DNA

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.110
is completely wrong along
the lines of there's

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.860
the intervening sequences,
the intron/exon organization

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:53.570
of genes.

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:56.270
Suddenly the opportunity
to mix and match

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:00.060
combinatorial abilities for
one gene, or at least one

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.090
stretch of DNA, to
specify a whole bunch

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.960
of different proteins, depending
on the function of the splicing

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.200
enzymes, and those
splicing enzymes

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.370
differing in different
parts of the body

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.110
under different circumstances.

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.429
We then saw that flabbergasting
business about 95% of DNA

00:04:17.429 --> 00:04:21.450
not coding for proteins, not
being genes, but instead,

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.410
the instruction manuals,
the promoters, the switching

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.110
on and off, leading to
that critical notion

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.870
of transcription factors
transducing events going on

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.760
out there, out there outside
the nucleus, outside the cell,

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.150
outside the organism,
into changes in DNA,

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.270
and thus the incredibly
important role of transcription

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:42.480
factors, promoters.

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.650
There are a lock and
key interactions.

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.930
All that sorts of
stuff introducing

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:50.270
the second critical
concept-- if microevolution

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:55.870
is about sort of changing the
function of a protein, changes

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:58.130
occurring at the level
of transcription factors

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:00.300
or promoters, those
are about changing

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.660
the context for which
proteins are functioning

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.030
when genes are expressing.

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:09.110
What they are about are
introducing if/then clauses.

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.920
If this is happening outside
the nucleus, cell, universe,

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:16.817
whatever, then if that results
in this gene being activated,

00:05:16.817 --> 00:05:18.150
then you will see that response.

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.910
What came along sort
of de facto with that,

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:23.560
the second major thing
that we thus trashed,

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.970
was DNA as the central starting
point, the dogma of life.

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.440
DNA is the only one who knows
what's going on out there.

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.950
DNA commands, RNA commands,
protein commands all of life.

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:38.960
And what we saw was DNA,
genes, are just a readout

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.050
and most of what it's about
is environmental regulation

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.170
of when genes activate.

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:48.740
Finally we began to see all
sorts of ways of futzing around

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.950
with gene expression
that has nothing

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:54.020
to do with the sequences
of DNA, but instead

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:58.060
has to do with things like
access of transcription factors

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:01.700
to the DNA, changing
accessibility permanently,

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:05.820
that whole world of
epistatic, epigenetic changes,

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:07.970
coming up with that
sound soundbite.

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:10.530
Fertilization is about genetics.

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:13.620
Development is about
epigenetics-- all of that

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:16.320
combining to show,
number one, genes

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:19.460
are not such a hot deal in
terms of them knowing what's up.

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.470
Number two, in
addition to mechanisms

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:24.360
known for
microevolutionary change,

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:28.540
we left just on the cusp of
seeing how all of this stuff

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:32.450
can set you up for some big
time macroevolutionary changes.

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:33.620
First example of it.

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:35.490
First way in which
that could occur.

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:38.180
So back to the modular
construction of genes.

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.330
We've got our introns,
exons, all of that.

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:42.350
And what we learned
the other day is here

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:45.290
we've got a gene coded
for with three exons.

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:48.760
You produce a messenger
RNA that encompasses

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:50.600
all of these plus the introns.

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:54.970
Along comes a specific splicing
enzyme, knocks out these parts,

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:57.210
and here is the mature protein.

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:58.550
So that's great.

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:03.040
What if you have a mutation
in your splicing factor,

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:06.060
in your splicing
enzyme, and as a result,

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:09.740
instead of clipping here,
it ignores those and clips

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:10.600
here instead.

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:11.720
What do you get?

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:14.150
You get two completely
novel proteins

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:18.220
that never existed before in
this cell, in this individual.

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:21.240
What you've got there
is not some sort

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:23.420
of little
microevolutionary change.

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:26.490
This is not a protein
working a little bit better

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:27.775
or a little bit more sluggish.

00:07:27.775 --> 00:07:31.130
This is the invention of
entirely new proteins.

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:35.190
So what we see here is splicing
factors working differently.

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:39.050
And this is a major
change, if whatever

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:42.500
went on in the outside world
that causes the then of this

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:45.890
being made, if you've got
that mutation in the splicing

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:48.680
factor, you've just made
entirely new if/then.

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:50.930
If whatever's going on
in the outside world

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:54.410
happens to activate this,
you produce these two novel

00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:55.700
proteins.

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:57.750
So we've suddenly
got the potential

00:07:57.750 --> 00:07:59.850
for producing all
sorts of novelty.

00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:04.300
They're splicing enzymes,
enzymes, proteins, thus there

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:07.610
are genes coding for
the splicing enzymes.

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:11.090
As a result, suddenly a very
different type of consequence.

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:12.242
Yeah, question?

00:08:12.242 --> 00:08:16.600
How often do those [INAUDIBLE]
make it out of the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:17.480
Great question.

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:20.390
How often do they make
their way out of the--

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:21.930
[INAUDIBLE]

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:23.080
What was that?

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:26.510
How often do the
mis-splice [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:28.960
successfully have function?

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:30.640
Do they have any function?

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:32.010
[INAUDIBLE]

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:33.780
That's a critical question.

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:36.330
Wait about an hour
and 17 minutes

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:38.659
and you will get the answer
to it-- the answer being,

00:08:38.659 --> 00:08:39.750
not very often.

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:40.440
Oops.

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:41.130
I gave it away.

00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:42.685
The answer being not very often.

00:08:42.685 --> 00:08:44.059
And we're going
to see why that's

00:08:44.059 --> 00:08:47.900
real critical to
punctuated equilibrium.

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:50.630
So we see one realm
of major consequence.

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:54.630
And intrinsic in that is,
wait a second-- so if splicing

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:56.840
enzymes, enzymes are genes.

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:59.430
There's a gene for
the splicing enzyme.

00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:01.950
And that gene has its promoters.

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:04.910
And that gene maybe is
in a number of exons.

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:07.080
And thus it needs
a splicing factor.

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:09.620
And we're rolling all
the way down there.

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:11.580
Recursive regulation.

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:14.300
So one splicing factor,
big consequence.

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:17.290
Next realm where you can
have a big consequence

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:21.400
is now you've got a
mutation in a promoter.

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:26.490
A whole world of a mutation in
a noncoding part of your DNA.

00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:29.190
And you can immediately
run with that one.

00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:31.270
Have a different
promoter, and it's

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:34.450
going to interact with a
different transcription factor.

00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:38.580
And we go back to that business
about typically a promoter,

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:42.300
the same version of it, multiple
copies of that promoter,

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:46.030
appear upstream of various
different genes-- promoters

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:50.460
mediating expression of
entire network of proteins.

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:54.330
Change that promoter and you're
going to change the network.

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:57.110
Change that promoter in
only some of the places

00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:59.710
where it occurs and
now you've created

00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:02.810
a completely novel network,
a network consisting maybe

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:04.970
of half of the proteins
that you would have

00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:06.930
made in the unmutated version.

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:08.890
Mutate every single
version of it,

00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:11.910
and maybe it's an entirely
different transcription

00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:14.840
factor that interacts
with that promoter.

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:18.820
And thus we've made an
entirely new if/then clause--

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:22.990
not just a new if/then make
a never seen before protein.

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:26.330
Now it's an if this
happens, then make

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:29.240
a network of proteins that
have never existed before,

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:32.450
a combination of these that
have never occurred before.

00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:34.240
What we're beginning
to see here is

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:36.940
a theme of amplifying affects.

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:39.880
Huge, major
consequences, instead of

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:42.680
one little protein which,
thanks to one little base pair

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:45.330
changing, is 1 and
1/2 degrees more

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:47.090
folded this way
instead of that way

00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:50.680
and 1.5% better at binding
this or that hormone.

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:54.960
That's the microevolutionary
this is setting up

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:57.250
for big network changes.

00:10:57.250 --> 00:11:02.120
Novel genes, novel networks,
novel if/then clauses.

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:06.020
Third range-- an example of
why promoters and promoter

00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:07.220
mutations are interesting.

00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:09.470
Later on in the course, we
are going to hear about one

00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:12.290
of the all time
interesting differences

00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:14.380
that you can have in
one of your promoters

00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:18.040
if you happen to be a vole and,
increasingly it's turning out,

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:20.480
equally interesting if
you happen to be a human.

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:24.160
This is a promoter
upstream of a gene

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:27.340
having to do with the
hormone vasopressin.

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:30.550
Do not panic or care if you
haven't heard of this yet.

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:32.950
But you will have in more
detail within a few weeks.

00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:36.310
Vasopressin is this
hormone which has something

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:41.430
or other to do with social
affiliated behavior in males

00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:43.620
and all sorts of
interesting stuff with that.

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:45.980
And naturally, it
being a hormone,

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:48.640
out there is a
vasopressin receptor.

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:51.760
And thus, there's a
vasopressin receptor gene.

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:54.250
And there's a promoter
upstream of that gene

00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:57.730
which turns out to come in a
couple of different flavors.

00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:02.180
And you look at voles, which
are a little hamster thingee

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:02.990
sort of things.

00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:04.990
And there's all sorts of
different vole species.

00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:06.460
And there's ones
in the mountains,

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:08.251
and there's ones in
the plains, and there's

00:12:08.251 --> 00:12:11.794
ones from California to
the New York islands.

00:12:11.794 --> 00:12:13.460
And there's all these
different species.

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:16.860
And it happens some of them
happened to be monogamous.

00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:19.000
Some of them happen
to be polygamous.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.130
We're off and running with
the social biology of that

00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:25.080
and how many imprinted genes and
all that they're going to have.

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:29.260
But a critical difference
in monogamous vole species--

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.700
there is a different
promoter upstream

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:34.330
of the vasopressin
receptor gene than you

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:37.650
find in the polygamist ones.

00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:39.870
And go and mess
around with them,

00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:43.500
use gene therapy techniques
to change the promoter

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:48.720
to modify it, and you could
convert a polygamous male vole

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:51.142
into a resoundingly
monogamous one.

00:12:51.142 --> 00:12:53.100
And I don't know if this
counts as gene therapy

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:56.370
like curing a disease or just
gene transfer sort of stuff,

00:12:56.370 --> 00:12:59.440
but what you've got here
is change your promoter

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:02.030
and you suddenly have
a different pattern

00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:04.680
of expression, which parts
of the brain it winds up in.

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:07.880
Suddenly you have made a
major shift in behavior.

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:10.480
You're not causing
a change in a gene.

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:12.330
You're causing a
change in its promoter.

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:16.070
You've just changed a
major if/then clause.

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:18.670
Another example of
it-- there is a gene

00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:21.880
that codes for hormone
neurotransmitter that

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:25.680
has something to do with pain
perception called dynorphin.

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:29.190
It's broadly related to
things like morphine and such.

00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:31.761
It's got a dynorphin gene
that's a little more complicated

00:13:31.761 --> 00:13:32.260
than that.

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:33.820
But there's a promoter upstream.

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:38.460
And recent research is showing
that the number of copies

00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:41.750
of that promoter
in different rats

00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:45.000
predicts something about how
readily they become addicted

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.920
to various drugs.

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:49.440
And that winds up
being pertinent.

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:50.190
Back for a second.

00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:52.380
Back to the vasopressin
gene and the vasopressin

00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:54.480
reporter gene and it's promoter.

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:58.120
In the last couple of years,
a number of studies come out.

00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:01.040
One, for example, in a
very credible journal

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:02.940
by a great group
showing that if you

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:07.830
happen to be a human male,
which version of that promoter

00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:10.960
you have gives you a certain
significant predictive power

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:15.536
over how stable your social
relationships are going to be.

00:14:15.536 --> 00:14:17.380
Get a load of that one.

00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:19.940
And that one is coming later on.

00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:20.640
Whoa.

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:24.370
Have a different type of
promoter and statistically

00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:29.170
you are more likely to get
divorced down the line.

00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:32.090
Back to that first
lecture freewill stuff.

00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:34.520
There is so much more to
come along those lines.

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:36.430
We will look at the
vasopressin system

00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:38.140
much more in the sex lectures.

00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:41.120
But again, that's not
a difference in a gene.

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:43.430
That's a difference
in the promoter.

00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:47.570
Next domain-- we've now seen
changes, subtle changes,

00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:49.770
dramatic changes,
in splicing enzymes

00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:53.000
and the genes underlying
them, changes in promoters.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.960
Next obvious domain where you
can get a macro, macro change

00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:00.930
is a mutation in a gene
for a transcription factor,

00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:02.120
obviously.

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:06.200
Do that and you're going to have
completely different networks.

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:10.000
Once again, you will have
changed if/then contingencies

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.040
dramatically.

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:15.440
Transcription factors are very,
very important, obviously.

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:17.750
One measure of
this-- when you look

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:20.660
at the human genome
versus the chimp genome,

00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:24.550
and we will eventually do that
in some detail and say, 98%

00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:27.180
of our genes in common,
which is kind of accurate.

00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:29.610
And you remember from the
other day how that's different.

00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:31.350
It's the level of
explanation than you

00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:33.740
sharing 50% of your genes
with your full sibling.

00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:34.610
All of that.

00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:39.040
Back to us sharing 90%,
98% of our DNA with chimps.

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:40.660
What are the differences?

00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:43.460
And there's going to be some
really interesting differences

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:45.560
we're going to focus
on down the line.

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:47.300
But one of the patterns
that's come out

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:50.510
of that is a
disproportionate share

00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:53.930
of the genetic differences
between humans and chimps

00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:57.930
are genes that code for
transcription factors.

00:15:57.930 --> 00:16:00.450
And that makes perfect sense.

00:16:00.450 --> 00:16:03.420
You get a change
in some gene coding

00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:06.160
for some structural
protein and maybe

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:08.700
your muscles will bend
a little bit this way

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:10.450
instead of that way,
or who knows what.

00:16:10.450 --> 00:16:13.600
You get a change in the gene
coding for transcription factor

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:17.360
and you will have invented
all sorts of novel networks.

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:20.110
So a disproportionate
share of what

00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:23.600
has gone on in evolution
differentiating us from chimps

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:26.310
are changes in
transcription factors.

00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:29.130
This was a big
triumph, big support,

00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:31.140
for a view that came
out in the '80s.

00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:34.350
There were a pair of scientists
at Berkeley, King and Wilson,

00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:36.980
and this iconic set
of studies they did.

00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:39.370
They were the first
persons, people,

00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:42.750
to come up with a
98% business there.

00:16:42.750 --> 00:16:45.720
And using very primitive
molecular techniques

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:47.860
that have since been
affirmed-- and they also

00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:51.050
came up with a prediction, a
purely theoretical one, which

00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:55.160
is, the most interesting changes
that will occur in evolution

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:59.620
are in regulatory parts of
DNA rather than in the coding

00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:00.930
parts for protein.

00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:03.030
And everything since
then has supported

00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:05.220
that, including
things like, you want

00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:08.569
to turn an ancestor
of a human and a chimp

00:17:08.569 --> 00:17:10.420
into something that
will look a whole lot

00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:12.569
different from a
chimp, turn into us,

00:17:12.569 --> 00:17:15.800
change stuff with
regulation, transcription

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:18.400
factors, promoters.

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:21.780
What you see with that
is this is endlessly

00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:25.212
networks for amplifying
effects for macro changes.

00:17:25.212 --> 00:17:27.670
And there's a new person in
the department, Bio department,

00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:29.890
Hunter Frazier, a new
assistant professor,

00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:32.470
who works in this
area showing just how

00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:34.880
much evolutionary
change is being driven

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:39.040
by change in regulatory
parts of the DNA world,

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:40.910
rather than the genes itself.

00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:45.160
Changing a little bit about how
this protein works, that's OK.

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:48.760
Changing if/then clauses
for entire networks,

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:50.470
that's hugely important.

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:52.360
Another interesting
factoid-- there's

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:54.420
now been the genomes
of, I don't know,

00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:57.630
about 100 different species
sequenced, and ranging

00:17:57.630 --> 00:18:00.680
from really short
genomes with I don't

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:04.240
know how many genes in
there, to the longest ones.

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:06.660
When you pile them up
and you look at them

00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:09.320
as a function of how
long their genomes are,

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:13.310
the more genes you find
in a species, the greater

00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:16.460
the percentage of
those genes are

00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:18.640
that are transcription factors.

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:22.360
And this makes
wonderful sense as well.

00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:26.570
You got one gene and you only
need one transcription factor.

00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:30.480
You got two genes and you could
milk maximal information out

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:32.430
of them with three
transcription factors.

00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:36.010
You transcribe A or B, or AB.

00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:38.400
You've got three genes
and there's seven.

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:41.171
And the equation
is 2 to the nth.

00:18:41.171 --> 00:18:41.670
This one.

00:18:41.670 --> 00:18:42.300
Whatever.

00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:45.960
But what you see is by four
genes, you're up to 15.

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:48.890
By five genes, you're
up to 30-- you're

00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:53.460
having an exponential, a
dramatic increase in the number

00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:56.860
of transcription factors
you need to take advantage

00:18:56.860 --> 00:19:01.070
of all the possible combinations
of networks of gene expression.

00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:04.760
The larger the number of
genes you find in an organism,

00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:08.690
the greater the percentage it
is of transcription factors.

00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:13.150
In other words, get tiny
little micro, micro changes

00:19:13.150 --> 00:19:16.870
in DNA coding for transcription
factor splicing, enzymes,

00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:20.820
promoters, and you're going to
have big major consequences.

00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:25.150
So over and over here, we see
this contrast microevolution is

00:19:25.150 --> 00:19:27.320
about the function of proteins.

00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:30.600
Macroevolution is
about which proteins--

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:35.990
when networks' if/then clauses
are far more consequential.

00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:38.800
One additional
domain of-- we're not

00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:41.060
talking about a tiny
little micro change

00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:43.600
in one base pair--
one additional domain,

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:47.700
a highly revolutionary one that
came some years ago that also

00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:49.790
has lots of implications
for thinking

00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:52.160
about macro stuff in evolution.

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:56.840
And this revolved around one of
the great irresistible musical

00:19:56.840 --> 00:20:00.640
dramas that have ever come
out of the history of science.

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:03.340
Once that is-- there's got
to be a musical somewhere

00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:06.910
in the future of this-- having
to do with a scientist named

00:20:06.910 --> 00:20:08.840
Barbara McClintock.

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:10.340
Barbara McClintock--
if you are sort

00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:13.770
of a modern molecular sort of
person, at some point or other,

00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:17.420
you will have to have sacrificed
a goat at the altar of Barbara

00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:18.400
McClintock.

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:22.110
She is so amazing and she
has such a stirring story

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:25.150
as to what happened with her,
one which actually is so.

00:20:25.150 --> 00:20:29.190
Barbara McClintock was born, I
don't know, about 1900 or so,

00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:32.800
and was a plant
geneticist and was sort of

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:36.910
off doing genetics of plants
and doing something or other

00:20:36.910 --> 00:20:37.470
with maize.

00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:38.940
Whatever those people do.

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:41.760
And she was
extremely successful.

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:44.050
She was wildly successful.

00:20:44.050 --> 00:20:47.424
I think at age 40 or
so in the late 1930s,

00:20:47.424 --> 00:20:48.840
she was already a
member of what's

00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:51.500
called the National
Academy of Sciences, which

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:54.880
is like the most honorific
science club you can belong to

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:55.890
in this country.

00:20:55.890 --> 00:20:59.070
40-year-old women
in 1940 were not

00:20:59.070 --> 00:21:01.800
becoming members of the
National Academy of Sciences.

00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:05.040
110-year-old white guys
with shiny foreheads

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:07.150
were becoming members
of the National Academy.

00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:09.620
For her to have been
elected at that point,

00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:12.900
she was an amazing scientist,
one of the absolute leaders

00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:13.770
in the field.

00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:16.400
So she's cruising along
there, being renowned.

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:19.440
And one day she made a
discovery that completely

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:21.160
destroyed her career.

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:25.850
So she's sitting there one day
and she studies beloved corn

00:21:25.850 --> 00:21:28.030
maize and the patterns
of inheritance

00:21:28.030 --> 00:21:30.050
based on colors of kernels.

00:21:30.050 --> 00:21:33.590
Genes, molecular biology,
like nonexistent.

00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:35.260
None of the stuff available now.

00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:37.470
All you could do in
terms of making sense

00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:40.590
of what is being inherited,
patterns of inheritance,

00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:43.050
is just looking
at the phenotype,

00:21:43.050 --> 00:21:44.560
looking at the appearance.

00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:47.134
Peas and whether they're
wrinkly or not, people

00:21:47.134 --> 00:21:48.800
and whether they're
wrinkly or not, corn

00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:51.690
and what the colors are of
the various kernels there.

00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:56.500
That was cutting edge molecular
sort of genetics at the time.

00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:59.900
So she's working in that domain
and she's seeing a result.

00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:02.290
She's seeing a
pattern of inheritance

00:22:02.290 --> 00:22:05.340
which keeps popping up
in certain circumstances.

00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:08.330
And you go through all of
the inferential math that

00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:10.820
was available and you
crunch through everything.

00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:14.490
And you, if you were Barbara
McClintock pursuing this,

00:22:14.490 --> 00:22:17.400
you come up with a conclusion
that is totally nutty.

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:21.790
The only way to explain how
this change was occurring

00:22:21.790 --> 00:22:26.510
was if genes were picking up
and moving around on the DNA,

00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:30.250
if gene were jumping around,
if genes were mobile,

00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:31.270
moving around.

00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:33.470
And out of this, she
came up with a proposal

00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:37.620
that there are such things
as transposable genes,

00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:41.100
transposable genetic
elements, transposons.

00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:44.420
All of the people who spent
decades afterward mocking her

00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:46.900
in various ridiculing
tones of voices

00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:49.200
soon referred to these
as jumping genes.

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:51.080
And the general
consensus in the field

00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:53.830
was that Barbara McClintock
had gone out of her mind.

00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:56.020
Yeah, genes jumping around.

00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:56.826
Yeah, right.

00:22:56.826 --> 00:22:58.200
I'll sell you the
Brooklyn Bridge

00:22:58.200 --> 00:22:59.408
after that if you believe it.

00:22:59.408 --> 00:23:00.790
That's ridiculous.

00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:02.180
That's ridiculous.

00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:07.010
And Barbara McClintock, having
a certain stoic self-esteem

00:23:07.010 --> 00:23:10.620
sort of based personality of
one that was-- basically said,

00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:12.040
you know what?

00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:13.332
This is what I see.

00:23:13.332 --> 00:23:14.790
You want to believe
it, believe it.

00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:16.250
You don't want to believe
it, don't believe it.

00:23:16.250 --> 00:23:18.450
Leave me alone, I want to
go back to my experiments.

00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:21.690
And she essentially
disappeared from the field

00:23:21.690 --> 00:23:24.020
and just sat out
in her cornfield

00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:27.080
at a lab in Long Island
called Cold Spring Harbor lab,

00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:30.230
and just chugged along on her
own for decades afterward.

00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:33.060
She wrote papers about it
that were incomprehensible

00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:35.260
to people, because
no one could believe

00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:36.740
anything this ridiculous.

00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:39.000
And she was developing
this whole story

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.990
about genes that move,
transposable genetic elements.

00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:44.350
Everybody ignored her.

00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:45.460
She was mocked.

00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:46.700
She was pilloried.

00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:48.431
She was burned at the stake.

00:23:48.431 --> 00:23:48.930
All of that.

00:23:48.930 --> 00:23:52.880
And then finally somewhere in
the 1980s, molecular techniques

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:57.020
caught up enough to show
she was absolutely right.

00:23:57.020 --> 00:24:00.410
And these things now
are called transposons.

00:24:00.410 --> 00:24:02.510
Transposable genetic elements.

00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:05.470
Genes really do pick
up and move around.

00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:08.520
And this was an amazing
landmark discovery.

00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:11.840
The entire world went crazy
about Barbara McClintock

00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:12.580
at the time.

00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:16.971
She was on the cover of Post's
Wheaties boxes of cereal.

00:24:16.971 --> 00:24:17.470
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:19.790
There were Barbara
McClintock lines

00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:26.600
of dance clothes and exercise
videos and recipe books

00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:27.480
and all of that.

00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:30.890
And somewhere along the way,
they gave her her Nobel Prize.

00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:32.710
And she was in her
late 80s at the time.

00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:35.330
And showing exactly the
stuff she was made out of,

00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:37.570
she said, well, that's nice.

00:24:37.570 --> 00:24:38.950
Thanks for the Nobel Prize.

00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:40.230
But you know what?

00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:42.360
I didn't really need
to have gotten it.

00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:43.600
This is what I saw.

00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:45.070
You want to believe
it, yes or no?

00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:46.050
You believe it now?

00:24:46.050 --> 00:24:46.685
That's nice.

00:24:46.685 --> 00:24:47.630
Leave me alone.

00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:48.940
Let me go back to work.

00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:49.440
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:53.000
And she continued to work in
her cornfields doing experiments

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.450
up until about a week before
her death in the early '90s.

00:24:56.450 --> 00:24:59.660
This is a totally
cool, amazing figure

00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:02.662
in the history of
science, a lonely pioneer.

00:25:02.662 --> 00:25:04.870
As it turned out, she wasn't
that lonely of a pioneer

00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:07.150
and people didn't think
she was quite that crazy.

00:25:07.150 --> 00:25:08.720
And apparently a
lot of her papers

00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:11.350
were ignored because
she could not write

00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:13.640
and her papers were
incomprehensible.

00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:15.800
But nonetheless,
the general picture

00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:18.380
was, she discovered
all of this on her own,

00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:21.180
staked her career on
this, and most people

00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:24.290
thought she was out of her
mind and eventually vindicated.

00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:27.370
Totally cool sort of piece
of the history of science.

00:25:27.370 --> 00:25:30.410
Really, really
inspirational person.

00:25:30.410 --> 00:25:34.100
And I met her once
and got to see her

00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:35.661
with her corn and she was--

00:25:35.661 --> 00:25:36.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:39.870
A remarkable-- she was like 90
at the time-- and a remarkably

00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:43.695
nice, low-key person, where
after about 13 and a half

00:25:43.695 --> 00:25:45.820
seconds, it was obvious
that what she mostly wanted

00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:47.444
was for me to get
the hell out of there

00:25:47.444 --> 00:25:49.580
so she could go back
to her corn, which

00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:51.600
was her response
to everybody there.

00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:53.720
But very heroic figure.

00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:56.780
So she discovers
this entire new world

00:25:56.780 --> 00:25:59.870
of these transposable
genetic elements.

00:25:59.870 --> 00:26:03.890
And people have been studying
it since, these jumping genes.

00:26:03.890 --> 00:26:05.630
The first thing that
has become clear

00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:09.740
as the field ha matured is
she picked the right species

00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:10.660
to study.

00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:14.960
She never would have discovered
transposable genetic elements

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:17.120
if she was out there
alone in her cornfield

00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:20.830
studying sperm
whales or something.

00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:23.014
Separate of the funding
problems and the logistics,

00:26:23.014 --> 00:26:24.180
she would not have found it.

00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:28.510
She did it in the right
organisms, which were plants.

00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:29.900
Think about it.

00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:31.030
You are an animal.

00:26:31.030 --> 00:26:34.030
And one of the things you can do
is, when the going gets tough,

00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:37.930
you can get up and run away, or
you can crawl away or fly away

00:26:37.930 --> 00:26:41.770
or whatever sort of animate
animal type things can do.

00:26:41.770 --> 00:26:44.170
If you're a plant,
you're stuck there.

00:26:44.170 --> 00:26:45.630
You can't run away.

00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:47.440
And if you're going to
survive a challenge,

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:49.023
you're going to have
to have something

00:26:49.023 --> 00:26:51.530
more subtle going for
you than, oh, let's run

00:26:51.530 --> 00:26:52.690
and get out of here.

00:26:52.690 --> 00:26:56.230
And it turns out all sorts
of realms of plant stress

00:26:56.230 --> 00:27:00.840
responses are in just the avant
garde of molecular biology.

00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:03.490
Plants have to
have fancier tricks

00:27:03.490 --> 00:27:07.850
than all sorts of boring animals
because plants don't run away.

00:27:07.850 --> 00:27:10.900
What they do instead, among
their various defenses, when

00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:15.140
a challenge, a pathogen, a
climate change, whatever it is

00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:17.140
comes along, one of
the things they do

00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:21.410
is there's realms of their DNA
where they move genes around,

00:27:21.410 --> 00:27:25.040
where they shuffle stuff around
in the hopes of stumbling

00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:29.320
onto something novel and useful
to get them out of that mess.

00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:33.160
Plants have induce-able
events of genes moving

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:35.240
transposable genetic elements.

00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:38.210
They tend to induce
them when the plant is

00:27:38.210 --> 00:27:42.020
under some sort of challenge,
a cellular stress response.

00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:44.070
And the way that's
done is by activating

00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:46.880
an enzyme called transposase.

00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:49.270
And those of you who are
new to the business, enzymes

00:27:49.270 --> 00:27:51.990
tend to have -ase
the end of the word--

00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:55.430
lactase, sucrase, transposase.

00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:57.850
And what you've
got there is, this

00:27:57.850 --> 00:27:59.570
is a defense on the
part of the plant.

00:27:59.570 --> 00:28:02.020
Juggle some of
its DNA prudently,

00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:04.710
and see if you can come up
with something to help you.

00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:06.930
Make a copy of
the gene, and then

00:28:06.930 --> 00:28:09.690
go plunk it down somewhere
else and see if you've

00:28:09.690 --> 00:28:11.960
stumbled into something useful.

00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:14.030
And it was only in the
aftermath that people

00:28:14.030 --> 00:28:17.640
started to look at the
same issue in animals

00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:19.340
and vertebrates and mammals.

00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:22.430
And shockingly to
everyone, except the people

00:28:22.430 --> 00:28:25.640
who hung out with her, was the
fact that we've got them, too.

00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:28.960
We've got transposable
genetic elements, we animals.

00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:29.880
We've got them.

00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:35.370
Where they were first discovered
made a lot of sense as well.

00:28:35.370 --> 00:28:38.350
You are some scientists
and you've just

00:28:38.350 --> 00:28:43.080
invented in your lab some
pathogen, some toxin,

00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:45.980
some who knows what, that
has never been seen before

00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:47.690
in the history of the planet.

00:28:47.690 --> 00:28:49.590
You've synthesized
it and you inject it

00:28:49.590 --> 00:28:51.130
in a whole bunch of people.

00:28:51.130 --> 00:28:53.730
And they get totally
sick and miserable.

00:28:53.730 --> 00:28:56.790
And then you come back two
weeks later, two months later,

00:28:56.790 --> 00:29:00.210
and they will have made
antibodies against that thing.

00:29:00.210 --> 00:29:02.000
Their body, their
immune systems,

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.990
will have made antibodies
against some invasive pathogen

00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:09.380
thingee that never
existed before

00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:10.950
in the history of the planet.

00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:15.150
And a staggering challenge
is how does the immune system

00:29:15.150 --> 00:29:17.970
come up with this
vast variability

00:29:17.970 --> 00:29:19.900
for dealing with
novel pathogens,

00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:23.380
making antibodies that
will recognize them?

00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:26.180
And people soon discovered
one of the tricks

00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:29.490
was splicing of genes
relevant to making

00:29:29.490 --> 00:29:33.050
antibodies and juggling
them around-- induce-able,

00:29:33.050 --> 00:29:36.170
transposable events--
in the hope of making

00:29:36.170 --> 00:29:39.140
a gazillion new
types of antibodies

00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:42.030
in a remarkable filtering
process that goes on

00:29:42.030 --> 00:29:44.560
in the immune system,
spotting are any of them

00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:47.490
good against this new
thing that just showed up?

00:29:47.490 --> 00:29:50.550
That's where you had a
lot of transposable events

00:29:50.550 --> 00:29:54.970
in the vertebrate immune system
in response to novel pathogens.

00:29:54.970 --> 00:29:56.812
Turns out, we
weren't the only ones

00:29:56.812 --> 00:29:58.770
doing that because there
were other things that

00:29:58.770 --> 00:29:59.561
could be happening.

00:29:59.561 --> 00:30:01.980
There were all sorts
of the pathogens that

00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:03.840
could do the same exact thing.

00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:07.700
There is one tropical
parasite, Trypanosome, which

00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:09.420
is one you do not want to get.

00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:12.770
And trypanosomiasis is
the inflammatory disease

00:30:12.770 --> 00:30:15.600
you get from a
trypanosome, this parasite,

00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:17.870
and it shows up in your
body, and your body

00:30:17.870 --> 00:30:19.950
does this induce-able
trick and, thank god,

00:30:19.950 --> 00:30:22.220
comes up with some
antibodies that could begin

00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:24.340
to target it and attack it.

00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:26.830
But trypanosomes also
worship at the altar

00:30:26.830 --> 00:30:28.130
of Barbara McClintock.

00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:31.010
What they do is, a
couple of weeks into it,

00:30:31.010 --> 00:30:34.710
they take away the surface
proteins on their surface

00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:37.470
and they juggle some
of the relevant DNA

00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:40.100
and come up with a
novel version of it.

00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:43.110
So just as you've got
the antibodies online,

00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:45.450
you can't recognize the
thing with those antibodies.

00:30:45.450 --> 00:30:47.920
You've got to start the
process all over again.

00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:51.590
And thus trypanosomes are
always a couple steps ahead,

00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:53.210
thus the immune
system has to have

00:30:53.210 --> 00:30:56.120
evolved better ways of juggling,
coming up with novel stuff.

00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:58.350
Co-evolutionary races there.

00:30:58.350 --> 00:31:01.580
But the cornerstone
of it is inducing

00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:03.835
movable genetic elements.

00:31:03.835 --> 00:31:05.460
And what people have
learned since then

00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:09.020
is it occurs outside of
just the immune system

00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:11.520
and under interesting
circumstances.

00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:16.260
One really amazing one, which
I was going to tell you later

00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:18.840
but I will tell you now because
I just can't wait-- there

00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:21.360
is one transposable
element that's

00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:23.330
very predominant in primates.

00:31:23.330 --> 00:31:27.350
And there is a certain cell
type and a certain time of life

00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:31.550
when it is most mobile, when it
moves around the most-- which

00:31:31.550 --> 00:31:35.260
is, the cells in your brain
that are going to be making

00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:39.600
new neurons, neural
progenitor cells, at the time

00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:42.800
that they start proliferating
and making new neurons.

00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:45.620
There is an induce-able
event at that time

00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:49.310
where you increase the movement
of that one genetic element.

00:31:49.310 --> 00:31:50.660
What are you doing?

00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:52.420
You're making some new neurons.

00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:55.120
And, as it turns out, in
a fairly controlled realm

00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:58.760
of your DNA, you decide to
shuffle the deck a little bit

00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:01.990
just because you want to get
the interesting novel sort

00:32:01.990 --> 00:32:04.190
of things that neurons can do.

00:32:04.190 --> 00:32:06.060
This is totally amazing.

00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:08.570
This is totally amazing because,
among other things, what

00:32:08.570 --> 00:32:11.520
this tells you is the
cells in your body

00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:15.010
that have the greatest thing to
do with making you who you are,

00:32:15.010 --> 00:32:18.480
are the least constrained
by genetic determinism.

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:21.130
Because right when these
types of cells, neurons,

00:32:21.130 --> 00:32:22.890
are first being
generated, they're

00:32:22.890 --> 00:32:25.270
doing more shuffling
of genetic cards

00:32:25.270 --> 00:32:27.390
than any other cell
type in the body.

00:32:27.390 --> 00:32:30.050
That sure takes away
the power of genes a lot

00:32:30.050 --> 00:32:31.690
when it comes to
the nervous system.

00:32:31.690 --> 00:32:35.690
These transposable events make
a whole lot of variability,

00:32:35.690 --> 00:32:37.826
some of which is wonderful.

00:32:37.826 --> 00:32:39.700
Some of which is not,
and this is coming back

00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:43.470
to the question that was asked
before, are these disastrous?

00:32:43.470 --> 00:32:45.440
In most of the cases, yes.

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:49.210
But in a few minutes, we'll see
exactly why it is not likely

00:32:49.210 --> 00:32:51.670
that when you randomly
shuffle a bunch of cards,

00:32:51.670 --> 00:32:55.190
they're going to come out in
a perfect sequence of numbers

00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:56.280
or some such thing.

00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:59.130
It is a long shot to get
something interesting out

00:32:59.130 --> 00:32:59.640
of it.

00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:02.590
Nonetheless, this is a
mechanism for doing this.

00:33:02.590 --> 00:33:06.510
What this allows you to
do by moving parts of DNA

00:33:06.510 --> 00:33:10.610
around, making a copy of this
stretch and then moving it

00:33:10.610 --> 00:33:12.960
and, I think-- I don't
know the field that well,

00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:15.050
but I think, at
least in most cases,

00:33:15.050 --> 00:33:18.150
the notion is it plunks
down randomly somewhere else

00:33:18.150 --> 00:33:19.010
in the genome.

00:33:19.010 --> 00:33:24.370
By moving stuff around, you can
have big macro consequences.

00:33:24.370 --> 00:33:31.150
For example, suppose
you've got, by now,

00:33:31.150 --> 00:33:33.540
and if/then clause
introducing this concept

00:33:33.540 --> 00:33:36.310
already-- if/then clause,
and we can translate

00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:39.720
this totally primitively
into worlds of promoters

00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:42.370
and worlds of the actual gene.

00:33:42.370 --> 00:33:44.340
So you've got an if/then clause.

00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:46.290
Suppose you are dehydrated.

00:33:46.290 --> 00:33:49.220
If you were dehydrated,
translating that

00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:52.555
into actual biology, I
don't know, your hematocrit

00:33:52.555 --> 00:33:56.400
or how wrinkly your kidneys
are getting or some such thing.

00:33:56.400 --> 00:34:00.120
Then tell your kidneys to
start doing something or other

00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:03.160
that kidneys do to retain
water, which I once understood

00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:04.910
for a finale, no longer do.

00:34:04.910 --> 00:34:07.140
But you wake them up and
they have some response.

00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:08.900
So we've got an if/then clause.

00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:13.120
If you were getting dehydrated,
then make your kidneys work

00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:15.270
in a way that increases
water retention.

00:34:15.270 --> 00:34:16.570
This is ridiculous.

00:34:16.570 --> 00:34:19.790
There is if you are getting
dehydrated promoter.

00:34:19.790 --> 00:34:22.110
There is no gene
that is equivalent.

00:34:22.110 --> 00:34:23.989
There's networks, though.

00:34:23.989 --> 00:34:25.530
There's networks,
and there's ways

00:34:25.530 --> 00:34:28.889
in which your kidney monitors
that and other outposts

00:34:28.889 --> 00:34:29.739
in your body.

00:34:29.739 --> 00:34:31.954
So we have a rough
if/then clause.

00:34:31.954 --> 00:34:33.620
Wouldn't take a whole
lot of imagination

00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:35.699
to turn that into real biology.

00:34:35.699 --> 00:34:39.290
Now suppose you have
some transposable events.

00:34:39.290 --> 00:34:43.600
Suppose whatever it is,
the promoter world of that,

00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:47.070
picks up and moves
and the if you

00:34:47.070 --> 00:34:50.260
were dehydrated part of the
if/then clause floats around.

00:34:50.260 --> 00:34:53.440
It gets plunked down
upstream from the genes

00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:55.830
that say go and ovulate.

00:34:55.830 --> 00:34:58.040
What have you just invented?

00:34:58.040 --> 00:35:00.270
What does this allow you to do?

00:35:00.270 --> 00:35:02.700
So now you've got an
if/then clause, a promoter

00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:06.050
of that response to
dehydration, and it turns

00:35:06.050 --> 00:35:09.390
on genes related to ovulation.

00:35:09.390 --> 00:35:10.960
What does that get for you?

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:11.615
Any ideas?

00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:16.384
Oh, come on.

00:35:16.384 --> 00:35:18.040
Ovulate really frequently.

00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:18.790
Ovulate--

00:35:18.790 --> 00:35:19.540
Really frequently.

00:35:19.540 --> 00:35:21.230
Really frequently.

00:35:21.230 --> 00:35:22.680
Depends on your threshold.

00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:26.110
If like you should be-- skip
orange juice in the morning,

00:35:26.110 --> 00:35:28.660
does that mean you're
dehydrated enough to ovulate.

00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:31.130
You could set it at a very
low threshold like that.

00:35:31.130 --> 00:35:31.892
You could do that.

00:35:31.892 --> 00:35:33.350
You could do
something else though.

00:35:33.350 --> 00:35:34.485
What else?

00:35:34.485 --> 00:35:34.984
[INAUDIBLE]

00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:42.080
You're about to
die of dehydration

00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:43.590
and that gives you
one last chance

00:35:43.590 --> 00:35:46.010
for a round of passing
on copies of your genes,

00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:48.350
if you could find some
guy who isn't dehydrated

00:35:48.350 --> 00:35:52.215
to dramatic blood flow extent.

00:35:52.215 --> 00:35:53.090
That's a possibility.

00:35:53.090 --> 00:35:54.452
What else can you do?

00:35:54.452 --> 00:35:55.690
Seasonal mating.

00:35:55.690 --> 00:35:57.940
Yes, seasonal mating.

00:35:57.940 --> 00:35:59.510
That's what it's
mostly used for.

00:35:59.510 --> 00:36:01.430
Certainly possibilities here.

00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:02.970
But what this
allows you-- you're

00:36:02.970 --> 00:36:05.660
a species where six months
of the year it's dry

00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:08.280
and six months of the year
it's wonderful wet and lush

00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:10.850
and exactly the time you
want to be having a baby.

00:36:10.850 --> 00:36:13.600
And you've got like a six
month gestational period.

00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:14.560
What do you want?

00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:17.810
You want your body to know
when it's the dry season,

00:36:17.810 --> 00:36:21.120
and that's the signal to mate,
because you want to give birth

00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:22.510
during the rainy season.

00:36:22.510 --> 00:36:27.570
And then there's species where
you are pregnant for two weeks

00:36:27.570 --> 00:36:28.180
or so.

00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:30.055
And what you want to
have there as a rule is,

00:36:30.055 --> 00:36:32.382
oh my god, if it's the
dry season, don't ovulate,

00:36:32.382 --> 00:36:34.590
because I'm going to give
birth to kids who are going

00:36:34.590 --> 00:36:36.190
to starve or some such thing.

00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:38.660
Let's wait until I
get a signal that I'm

00:36:38.660 --> 00:36:40.840
totally wet and hydrated.

00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:41.640
Then ovulate.

00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:44.360
You introduce novel
if/then clauses.

00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:46.140
And for certain
species, this would

00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:49.190
be how you would do
seasonal mating-- how

00:36:49.190 --> 00:36:51.690
to know you should
obviously at a time of year

00:36:51.690 --> 00:36:53.992
where, given your
gestation length,

00:36:53.992 --> 00:36:55.700
it's going to set you
up for giving birth

00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:57.550
at the time of year
when your offspring are

00:36:57.550 --> 00:36:58.625
most likely to survive.

00:36:58.625 --> 00:37:01.170
And thus, you will have passed
on copies of your genes.

00:37:01.170 --> 00:37:01.780
All of that.

00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:02.810
So that's great.

00:37:02.810 --> 00:37:04.290
Another example.

00:37:04.290 --> 00:37:06.390
And this one is
immediately accessible

00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:09.390
and is a first crude
way of beginning

00:37:09.390 --> 00:37:12.820
to approach some of this stuff
that just flowed seamlessly

00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:14.550
and cheaply in the
forms of theories

00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:16.190
from last week's stuff.

00:37:16.190 --> 00:37:20.050
So you have some
if/then element in there

00:37:20.050 --> 00:37:23.030
and a promoter
which, in some way,

00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:27.120
can tell this individual
near me smells like me.

00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:29.780
And we will see, by
next week, exactly how

00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:31.660
that translates into genetics.

00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:35.020
But this individual kind
of smells a lot like me.

00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:38.070
And it has an if/then clause
which immediately shuts down

00:37:38.070 --> 00:37:43.230
transcription of all sorts of
things related to fertility.

00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:45.040
You don't mate with relatives.

00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:48.560
Some sort of incest taboo runs
through a gazillion species

00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:49.390
out there.

00:37:49.390 --> 00:37:52.910
Individuals smelling like
you, if you were a hamster,

00:37:52.910 --> 00:37:55.210
make you much less
likely to mate with them.

00:37:55.210 --> 00:37:57.450
So a very logical
if/then clause.

00:37:57.450 --> 00:37:58.430
All that works great.

00:37:58.430 --> 00:38:02.170
And now you've had a
transposable genetic event.

00:38:02.170 --> 00:38:06.230
And you plunk down the,
if it smells like me then,

00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:09.980
into upstream of the
gene that says cooperate.

00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:11.620
And what have we just invented?

00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:13.520
The starts of kin selection.

00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:15.790
And you could see all
sorts of rules like,

00:38:15.790 --> 00:38:17.990
if you have more
promoters, you could

00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:20.810
begin to have subtleties
of saying, if they really,

00:38:20.810 --> 00:38:24.190
really smell a lot like me,
like if all these promoters are

00:38:24.190 --> 00:38:27.710
going off at once, then really,
really, really cooperate.

00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:30.890
If they smell only somewhat like
me, only somewhat cooperate.

00:38:30.890 --> 00:38:32.780
You could begin
to fine tune that.

00:38:32.780 --> 00:38:34.330
What have you just invented?

00:38:34.330 --> 00:38:37.160
A way of taking
sensory information

00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:39.700
about degree of related-ness
and turning that

00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:43.720
into your extent of sacrificing
for one sibling or eight

00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:44.760
cousins.

00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:48.670
So you could begin to see how
you invent new if/then clauses.

00:38:48.670 --> 00:38:50.960
Obviously this is ridiculous.

00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:53.060
Obviously this bears
no relationship

00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:55.020
to what's going on
in the real world.

00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:57.290
This would be happening
in nose cells.

00:38:57.290 --> 00:39:00.910
This is occurring
down in the ovaries.

00:39:00.910 --> 00:39:04.840
There is no promoter that
responds to, oh, somebody

00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:06.230
here is smelling like me.

00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:08.790
But there are some that do stuff
not all that far from that.

00:39:08.790 --> 00:39:11.650
You could begin to
imagine turning this

00:39:11.650 --> 00:39:14.820
into real biology, how you
could program for this.

00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:17.090
And once you've got
genes moving around,

00:39:17.090 --> 00:39:19.700
you've plunked a promoter
down someplace else.

00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:22.900
You've just made a
new if/then clause.

00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:26.390
Now the possibilities is of
transposing genetic elements,

00:39:26.390 --> 00:39:30.630
also raises the possibility
of moving around

00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:34.450
parts of genes-- not just
parts of regulatory elements--

00:39:34.450 --> 00:39:36.280
moving around parts of genes.

00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:37.340
How would you do that?

00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:38.930
How would you move
a part of a gene?

00:39:38.930 --> 00:39:39.650
Exons.

00:39:39.650 --> 00:39:41.870
That's that modular
construction of genes

00:39:41.870 --> 00:39:44.760
again, where if you
get a transposase

00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:46.540
that comes and does
its thing there,

00:39:46.540 --> 00:39:49.970
and in making a copy of this,
moves this stretch around,

00:39:49.970 --> 00:39:53.610
you're now moving copies
of parts of genes around.

00:39:53.610 --> 00:39:55.930
And you can relate new genes.

00:39:55.930 --> 00:39:59.400
For example, here we
have the basic mechanism

00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:02.190
of action of steroid hormones.

00:40:02.190 --> 00:40:04.140
You guys who need an
introduction to that,

00:40:04.140 --> 00:40:05.810
we'll get it in a week or two.

00:40:05.810 --> 00:40:09.000
Steroid hormones--
hormones like estrogen,

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:12.190
progesterone, testosterone,
glucocorticoids.

00:40:12.190 --> 00:40:14.420
All of these, they
work as follows.

00:40:14.420 --> 00:40:17.000
Steroid hormones can
enter a target cell

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.540
and they bind to their receptor.

00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:19.650
Yes, indeed.

00:40:19.650 --> 00:40:20.430
Lock and key.

00:40:20.430 --> 00:40:21.325
All that happens.

00:40:21.325 --> 00:40:24.437
Steroid hormones are
not made of amino acids.

00:40:24.437 --> 00:40:25.770
They have a different structure.

00:40:25.770 --> 00:40:28.400
But nonetheless, each
has a distinctive shape.

00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:32.300
And each type of receptor
for a type of steroid hormone

00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:35.595
has a distinctive shape driven
by its amino acid sequence

00:40:35.595 --> 00:40:36.470
and those gene codes.

00:40:36.470 --> 00:40:37.260
All of that.

00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:40.490
So you've got a specific type
of steroid hormone fitting

00:40:40.490 --> 00:40:43.180
into its specific type
of receptor-- estrogen

00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:45.860
into an estrogen receptor,
that sort of thing.

00:40:45.860 --> 00:40:47.740
And what it does
as a result is it

00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:50.130
activates this receptor complex.

00:40:50.130 --> 00:40:53.360
And on the other side
of it, is a confirmation

00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:59.070
which recognizes a particular
promoter down on the DNA.

00:40:59.070 --> 00:41:03.330
A, in this case, what would be
called an estrogen responsive

00:41:03.330 --> 00:41:04.155
promoter.

00:41:04.155 --> 00:41:05.280
So what have you got there?

00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:08.020
You've got events going
on in the outside world.

00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:11.150
You are reading the
right parts of some novel

00:41:11.150 --> 00:41:13.380
and suddenly you're
secreting certain hormones

00:41:13.380 --> 00:41:14.600
that weren't there before.

00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:18.420
And you're changing genomic
effects shortly afterward.

00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:21.530
This is environment
regulating genes like crazy.

00:41:21.530 --> 00:41:23.230
What is this requiring?

00:41:23.230 --> 00:41:26.470
One part of the receptor
recognizing the hormone,

00:41:26.470 --> 00:41:27.560
specifically.

00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:30.260
And one part of the
receptor recognizing

00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:33.250
its specific
appropriate promoter.

00:41:33.250 --> 00:41:37.010
So now along comes one of
those transposable events.

00:41:37.010 --> 00:41:38.810
And it happens,
steroid hormones--

00:41:38.810 --> 00:41:42.580
this would be called the
hormone binding domain.

00:41:42.580 --> 00:41:45.700
And this would be called
the DNA binding domain.

00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:49.080
In steroid receptor genes,
those are in different exons.

00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:53.420
And suppose along comes
a transposable event.

00:41:53.420 --> 00:41:56.120
And you clip this part
off and you stick it

00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:58.530
in a different hormone
binding domain.

00:41:58.530 --> 00:42:01.990
So you've just made a completely
different if/then clause.

00:42:01.990 --> 00:42:05.240
If this hormone is
around, then do this.

00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:08.670
Now suddenly instead it's,
if this hormone is around,

00:42:08.670 --> 00:42:09.870
then do this.

00:42:09.870 --> 00:42:11.210
New if/then clause.

00:42:11.210 --> 00:42:13.400
Here would be one possibility.

00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:15.030
One of the class of
steroid hormones,

00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:17.780
glucocorticoids,
which eventually you

00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:21.010
will come to love because you
will hear endlessly about it.

00:42:21.010 --> 00:42:24.520
And glucocorticoids,
they're stress hormones.

00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:26.280
Human version of hydrocortisone.

00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:27.970
For our purposes
right now, what's

00:42:27.970 --> 00:42:31.790
interesting about them is they
suppress the immune system.

00:42:31.790 --> 00:42:34.880
These are steroidal
anti-inflammatories.

00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:37.010
When you're taking
non-steroidals,

00:42:37.010 --> 00:42:39.240
you're taking things that
work like glucocorticoids

00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:40.830
on the immune system,
but they don't

00:42:40.830 --> 00:42:42.230
have some of the side effects.

00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:44.970
Glucocorticoids suppress
the immune system.

00:42:44.970 --> 00:42:46.870
It is very well understood.

00:42:46.870 --> 00:42:48.820
And glucocorticoids
come in and bind

00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:52.550
to the hormone binding domain
of the glucocorticoid receptor.

00:42:52.550 --> 00:42:56.070
And this translocates to a
glucocorticoid responsive

00:42:56.070 --> 00:42:56.820
promoter.

00:42:56.820 --> 00:42:58.080
That's its whole thing.

00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:02.070
So now you have gotten
a transposable event.

00:43:02.070 --> 00:43:07.030
And what you've done
instead is plunked down

00:43:07.030 --> 00:43:11.365
the hormone binding domain
from the progesterone receptor.

00:43:11.365 --> 00:43:13.950
So suddenly you've
got an if/then clause

00:43:13.950 --> 00:43:17.010
that's novel, instead of,
if they are glucocorticoids

00:43:17.010 --> 00:43:19.040
around, suppress immunity.

00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:21.680
Now instead you've got,
if there's progesterone

00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:24.210
around, suppress immunity.

00:43:24.210 --> 00:43:27.280
What do you think
you've just invented?

00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:29.570
Any uses for that?

00:43:29.570 --> 00:43:33.660
If you happen to know what
progesterone is about and where

00:43:33.660 --> 00:43:36.430
that might have been a great
invention to come up with.

00:43:36.430 --> 00:43:37.804
Any speculation?

00:43:37.804 --> 00:43:39.160
During pregnancy?

00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:40.730
During pregnancy.

00:43:40.730 --> 00:43:44.520
Progesterone, which
is progestational--

00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:48.190
so you suppress your immune
system during pregnancy.

00:43:48.190 --> 00:43:49.050
How come?

00:43:49.050 --> 00:43:51.185
Why is that a
clever thing to do?

00:43:51.185 --> 00:43:53.742
So your body doesn't
eat your baby.

00:43:53.742 --> 00:43:55.430
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:55.430 --> 00:43:58.176
Did you just say so your
body doesn't eat your baby?

00:43:58.176 --> 00:44:00.710
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:00.710 --> 00:44:03.970
Well, there you go.

00:44:03.970 --> 00:44:07.310
I don't know what your family
is like, but I won't speculate.

00:44:07.310 --> 00:44:08.450
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:08.450 --> 00:44:09.000
But, yeah.

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.460
You do that so your body
won't eat your baby.

00:44:11.460 --> 00:44:14.350
So your body doesn't do
that, so that you don't have

00:44:14.350 --> 00:44:16.410
an immune reaction against it.

00:44:16.410 --> 00:44:20.360
And that's a whole world of
having to decide this thing

00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:22.250
belongs here,
instead of this thing

00:44:22.250 --> 00:44:25.000
having invaded my
placenta-- back

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.740
to that word that was used
by gynecologists talking

00:44:27.740 --> 00:44:30.150
about last week--
the imprinted genes.

00:44:30.150 --> 00:44:33.250
Male derived imprinted genes
making for a more potent

00:44:33.250 --> 00:44:35.410
invasion into the placenta.

00:44:35.410 --> 00:44:36.510
All of that.

00:44:36.510 --> 00:44:37.160
Yeah.

00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:40.410
This is a great way to
now do that deal of,

00:44:40.410 --> 00:44:42.710
you suppress immunity
during pregnancy,

00:44:42.710 --> 00:44:45.470
you are less likely to have
some weird immune attack

00:44:45.470 --> 00:44:46.600
on your fetus.

00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:48.930
And that was a great invention.

00:44:48.930 --> 00:44:51.400
That was a wonderful thing
to have come up with.

00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:53.250
There's an interesting
consequence of that,

00:44:53.250 --> 00:44:54.930
though, one that
pops up in medicine

00:44:54.930 --> 00:44:57.440
often, which is--
so you are immune

00:44:57.440 --> 00:45:00.190
suppressed because
you're pregnant

00:45:00.190 --> 00:45:03.900
and then you give birth, and you
stop being immune suppressed.

00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:06.590
The progesterone disappears
for the most part.

00:45:06.590 --> 00:45:09.460
You're off into a very different
endocrine world at that point.

00:45:09.460 --> 00:45:13.490
Your immune system comes back
to where it was before hand.

00:45:13.490 --> 00:45:15.990
But there is a
potential problem,

00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:18.860
which is your immune
system is so wiped out

00:45:18.860 --> 00:45:22.020
and you're so distracted
changing diapers and having

00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:24.624
no sleep whatsoever, and
so your immune system is

00:45:24.624 --> 00:45:25.790
a little bit out of control.

00:45:25.790 --> 00:45:29.700
What if it recovers from this
pregnancy immune suppression

00:45:29.700 --> 00:45:32.250
and, instead of coming back
to where it was before,

00:45:32.250 --> 00:45:34.470
it overshoots a little bit?

00:45:34.470 --> 00:45:36.360
What have you gotten
at that point?

00:45:39.710 --> 00:45:42.880
Your immune system shoots
into being more active than it

00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:44.270
should be at that point.

00:45:44.270 --> 00:45:46.900
What class of diseases
are you set up for now?

00:45:46.900 --> 00:45:47.480
Autoimmune.

00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:48.420
Autoimmune disease.

00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:50.406
Whoa, that's as good
as the lock and key,

00:45:50.406 --> 00:45:51.530
everybody knowing that one.

00:45:51.530 --> 00:45:53.990
You are set up for an
autoimmune disease then.

00:45:53.990 --> 00:45:57.020
There is a whole realm
of autoimmune diseases

00:45:57.020 --> 00:45:59.140
that tend to have
either initial onset

00:45:59.140 --> 00:46:02.810
or flare up in the post
parturition period for women.

00:46:02.810 --> 00:46:04.810
And in fact, there are
some autoimmune diseases,

00:46:04.810 --> 00:46:07.060
a very serious
form, say, of lupus,

00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:09.230
women really should
not get pregnant,

00:46:09.230 --> 00:46:13.390
because they are going to get
such a burst of lupus flare ups

00:46:13.390 --> 00:46:14.170
afterward.

00:46:14.170 --> 00:46:18.290
So this is a clever thing
during pregnancy, as usual.

00:46:18.290 --> 00:46:19.710
You don't want to overdo it.

00:46:19.710 --> 00:46:22.430
Our main point here
though is, by doing

00:46:22.430 --> 00:46:26.110
some transposable event,
moving one exon around

00:46:26.110 --> 00:46:28.170
and sticking it to
another exon that never

00:46:28.170 --> 00:46:32.120
existed before, you've made
up a completely novel if/then

00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:34.060
clause.

00:46:34.060 --> 00:46:35.490
So where have we gotten so far?

00:46:35.490 --> 00:46:39.520
We are worlds away from
the dull, gradualist world

00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:43.870
of micromutational stuff from
the other day of one protein

00:46:43.870 --> 00:46:45.450
working differently.

00:46:45.450 --> 00:46:48.780
You have the capacity to invent
completely novel proteins

00:46:48.780 --> 00:46:52.790
through splicing enzyme changes,
through transposable events.

00:46:52.790 --> 00:46:56.320
You have the opportunity to
make completely novel networks

00:46:56.320 --> 00:46:59.260
with mutations and
promoters, with mutations

00:46:59.260 --> 00:47:00.710
and transcription factors.

00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:04.880
What all of this means is, there
is going to be major changes.

00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:06.790
And thus, after a
five minute break,

00:47:06.790 --> 00:47:08.350
we will come back
to your question

00:47:08.350 --> 00:47:11.420
there of, what are the odds
of these changes actually

00:47:11.420 --> 00:47:13.090
being good for you?

00:47:13.090 --> 00:47:15.470
So a five minute break.

00:47:15.470 --> 00:47:19.060
Sometimes you will find a
gene will be duplicated.

00:47:19.060 --> 00:47:21.440
There will be an extra
copy of the gene.

00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:24.400
There will be two copies,
one after the other.

00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:26.150
Gene duplication.

00:47:26.150 --> 00:47:31.060
Sometimes, you can have even a
larger expansion of the number

00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:32.320
of copies of a gene.

00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:35.710
Or you can have duplication
of a whole stretch of genes.

00:47:35.710 --> 00:47:37.900
And this is falling
into this new area

00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:42.750
that people refer to, calling
it copy number variant.

00:47:42.750 --> 00:47:46.640
And ranging from one
extra copy of one gene

00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:50.600
to massive duplication of
whole stretches of chromosomes.

00:47:50.600 --> 00:47:53.260
And no surprise,
you wind up getting

00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:55.990
interestingly different
things going on at that point.

00:47:55.990 --> 00:47:58.070
What we'll see later
on in the course is,

00:47:58.070 --> 00:48:01.460
there is more and more evidence
that the disease schizophrenia

00:48:01.460 --> 00:48:05.010
involves mutations in
copy number variance.

00:48:05.010 --> 00:48:08.660
And here, this is not a
mutation in one base pair.

00:48:08.660 --> 00:48:11.110
This is not a mutation
in one transcription.

00:48:11.110 --> 00:48:14.400
This is extra copies
of genes sitting there.

00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:17.730
This can have some very
interesting implications.

00:48:17.730 --> 00:48:21.460
In some cases, the second
gene can function as a backup.

00:48:21.460 --> 00:48:23.700
If something goes
wrong in the first one,

00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:25.580
there's a second one
there doing its job.

00:48:25.580 --> 00:48:28.390
And there is some suggestion
that something like that

00:48:28.390 --> 00:48:32.520
is occurring in some subsets
of Alzheimer's disease.

00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:36.740
Or what you can have is the
number of copies of the gene

00:48:36.740 --> 00:48:39.680
you make has something to do
with how much of the protein

00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:40.470
you make.

00:48:40.470 --> 00:48:42.510
And there's recent
studies showing

00:48:42.510 --> 00:48:45.640
that when you compare
Japanese populations

00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:48.520
with Western European
ones, on the average,

00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:52.030
Japanese populations have
more copies of a gene that

00:48:52.030 --> 00:48:54.570
has multiple copies, more
copies of a gene that

00:48:54.570 --> 00:48:58.140
makes an enzyme related
to carbohydrate digestion.

00:48:58.140 --> 00:49:00.810
I have no idea what the
implications would be of that.

00:49:00.810 --> 00:49:05.330
But this is not a populational
difference in a DNA sequence

00:49:05.330 --> 00:49:09.260
or in a-- this is simply the
number of copies of the gene.

00:49:09.260 --> 00:49:12.150
What a second copy,
what a duplication also

00:49:12.150 --> 00:49:15.040
allows you to do in the
most metaphorical sense

00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:17.970
is experiment with
one of the copies.

00:49:17.970 --> 00:49:19.530
Because the other
one is there taking

00:49:19.530 --> 00:49:21.830
care of whatever the
function is that's critical,

00:49:21.830 --> 00:49:26.370
what you'll see is you get
faster evolution going on

00:49:26.370 --> 00:49:29.510
with genes that you have
duplicated, where one of them

00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:32.020
is the one that, in
a sense, is freed

00:49:32.020 --> 00:49:33.670
to have more dramatic movement.

00:49:33.670 --> 00:49:35.820
And what you then
see is it's more

00:49:35.820 --> 00:49:39.330
likely to stumble
into some great use

00:49:39.330 --> 00:49:42.580
without sacrificing the
initial use in the process.

00:49:42.580 --> 00:49:44.050
And there's a guy
at the University

00:49:44.050 --> 00:49:45.680
of Oregon named
Joe Thornton who's

00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:49.660
done really interesting work
on the evolution of genes

00:49:49.660 --> 00:49:51.600
for steroid receptors.

00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:54.020
And what he has shown
from ancestral genes

00:49:54.020 --> 00:49:56.380
is that's exactly
what's occurred.

00:49:56.380 --> 00:49:59.720
A lot of what are now two
different genes for two

00:49:59.720 --> 00:50:02.380
different types of
steroids receptors

00:50:02.380 --> 00:50:05.030
were once duplicates
of the same gene.

00:50:05.030 --> 00:50:08.250
And one was allowed to
float and eventually,

00:50:08.250 --> 00:50:11.100
in at least some cases,
stumbled into something useful,

00:50:11.100 --> 00:50:13.880
while the other one
held into place.

00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:16.800
In passing, what
that phenomenon does

00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:20.670
is help explain one of
the endless, frustrating,

00:50:20.670 --> 00:50:24.110
exasperating, irritating
things that people

00:50:24.110 --> 00:50:26.750
who attack the notion
of evolution bring up,

00:50:26.750 --> 00:50:33.550
which is the famed sound bite
that they have of the problem

00:50:33.550 --> 00:50:35.510
irreducible complexity.

00:50:35.510 --> 00:50:37.010
It always runs the
same way, which

00:50:37.010 --> 00:50:38.920
is saying that
evolution can't possibly

00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:43.620
exist because is what
good is half of an eye?

00:50:43.620 --> 00:50:45.510
You've got to have those
intermediate forms.

00:50:45.510 --> 00:50:47.980
And what good is it-- you
couldn't have invented.

00:50:47.980 --> 00:50:49.960
Evolution could not
have produced an eye

00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:52.967
in one mutation, one
generation, and thus it

00:50:52.967 --> 00:50:54.550
would have to be in
a series of steps.

00:50:54.550 --> 00:50:56.360
And what good are
the series of steps?

00:50:56.360 --> 00:50:57.110
They can't exist.

00:50:57.110 --> 00:51:00.260
There can't be anything
such as evolution.

00:51:00.260 --> 00:51:00.890
Off you go.

00:51:00.890 --> 00:51:01.840
Hallelujah.

00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:04.540
So what you get
here in these cases

00:51:04.540 --> 00:51:07.400
is a demonstration,
instead, by having

00:51:07.400 --> 00:51:12.440
extra copies of genes, one of
which is freed to be evolving.

00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:15.640
You don't have to have a
rapid transition from one

00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:16.510
to the other.

00:51:16.510 --> 00:51:19.690
You can have this thing
moving along, stumbling along,

00:51:19.690 --> 00:51:24.970
until it just happens to come up
with a shape of a receptor that

00:51:24.970 --> 00:51:29.070
just happens to be able to
bind a hormone that stumbled

00:51:29.070 --> 00:51:32.740
its own way into existence
10,000 generations earlier,

00:51:32.740 --> 00:51:35.940
which because it was duplicated,
it didn't matter that one

00:51:35.940 --> 00:51:39.800
copy was now of a form where
there was no receptor on earth

00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:43.020
for it until it happened
to stumble into that.

00:51:43.020 --> 00:51:44.650
And there is more
and more evidence

00:51:44.650 --> 00:51:48.360
that duplicated genes
have a way of describing

00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:51.990
these intermediate states
where you don't necessarily

00:51:51.990 --> 00:51:54.390
have half an eye,
but instead you

00:51:54.390 --> 00:51:56.520
have the pieces
ready in place there

00:51:56.520 --> 00:51:58.690
for when one thing
suddenly pops up,

00:51:58.690 --> 00:52:00.270
which completes the picture.

00:52:00.270 --> 00:52:03.210
In fact, you can have, as
it turns out, sort of half.

00:52:03.210 --> 00:52:05.430
Russ Fernald in the
biology department

00:52:05.430 --> 00:52:08.520
has done really cool research
on the evolution of eyes.

00:52:08.520 --> 00:52:10.690
And you should read
about it some time

00:52:10.690 --> 00:52:13.280
to read basically
how eyes evolved

00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:15.980
from a single layer of
cells on the surface

00:52:15.980 --> 00:52:18.440
of some ancient proto something.

00:52:18.440 --> 00:52:20.880
And you sure can
have half an eye

00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:22.720
and a zillion
intermediate forms.

00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:25.890
None the less, this
business of multiple copies

00:52:25.890 --> 00:52:30.650
allowing you the freedom to have
loser evolving of single genes

00:52:30.650 --> 00:52:33.970
of a time-- critical mechanism.

00:52:33.970 --> 00:52:37.310
So now we've got all of our
pieces in place-- changes

00:52:37.310 --> 00:52:40.640
in splicing enzymes and
promoters and transcription

00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:42.910
factors and transportable
elements and number

00:52:42.910 --> 00:52:45.290
of copies of genes,
number of copies

00:52:45.290 --> 00:52:46.800
of whole stretches of genes.

00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:49.550
What wind up being the
consequences of this?

00:52:49.550 --> 00:52:52.200
Back to the question
brought up before.

00:52:52.200 --> 00:52:56.180
So what we saw the other day is
some time futz around with one

00:52:56.180 --> 00:52:58.802
single base pair,
one single gene,

00:52:58.802 --> 00:53:00.510
and you've got somebody
who's going to be

00:53:00.510 --> 00:53:02.260
dead at three months of age.

00:53:02.260 --> 00:53:04.570
PKU, phenylketonuria.

00:53:04.570 --> 00:53:08.120
One single gene could be
a total, utter disaster.

00:53:08.120 --> 00:53:09.230
My god.

00:53:09.230 --> 00:53:13.410
Instead now, thanks to these
macro evolutionary changes,

00:53:13.410 --> 00:53:16.650
you change one single
base pair and as a result

00:53:16.650 --> 00:53:20.590
you change-- one, two,
three-- seven different genes.

00:53:20.590 --> 00:53:21.460
No, not seven.

00:53:21.460 --> 00:53:23.720
But you change
more than one gene,

00:53:23.720 --> 00:53:26.400
you have one single
base pair change,

00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:28.320
and if it's an exon
that's used in a lot

00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:30.200
of different
combinatorial ways, you've

00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:32.920
now produced mutated
versions of a whole bunch

00:53:32.920 --> 00:53:33.860
of different proteins.

00:53:33.860 --> 00:53:37.460
One single change in the
transcription factor and you've

00:53:37.460 --> 00:53:41.040
invented an entirely new
network of expression.

00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:44.340
What are the odds of
stumbling into something there

00:53:44.340 --> 00:53:48.410
that is going to suddenly be
great and wonderful in all

00:53:48.410 --> 00:53:50.130
those different
areas of consequence?

00:53:50.130 --> 00:53:52.350
It's really unlikely.

00:53:52.350 --> 00:53:54.560
What have we just seen here?

00:53:54.560 --> 00:54:00.280
This is a very stabilizing
mechanism for equilibrium.

00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:03.050
Equilibrium, long
periods of stasis.

00:54:03.050 --> 00:54:06.040
What we've got is,
if a single base pair

00:54:06.040 --> 00:54:10.000
change is going to affect half
a dozen different proteins

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:12.210
or affect, through a
transcription factor,

00:54:12.210 --> 00:54:16.200
entire networks, the odds are
pretty lousy that you are just

00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:18.730
going to happen to
stumble into one that

00:54:18.730 --> 00:54:20.960
works in all those
domains, or at least

00:54:20.960 --> 00:54:24.130
works in enough of them that
it doesn't do you in in others.

00:54:24.130 --> 00:54:26.950
Most of these macro
mutational changes

00:54:26.950 --> 00:54:28.990
are going to be bad news.

00:54:28.990 --> 00:54:31.130
Most of the time,
in other words,

00:54:31.130 --> 00:54:34.400
there is stabilizing
selection against

00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:36.320
macro mutational changes.

00:54:36.320 --> 00:54:37.930
So what have we just gotten?

00:54:37.930 --> 00:54:41.240
We've just gotten
a straight line.

00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:44.010
We've just gotten long
periods of stasis.

00:54:44.010 --> 00:54:46.300
So when do the changes come?

00:54:46.300 --> 00:54:49.510
When you have some circumstance
that is extreme enough

00:54:49.510 --> 00:54:52.400
that it doesn't matter
that if this mutation--

00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:55.700
you have made elevendy
new types of proteins.

00:54:55.700 --> 00:54:59.340
And elevendy minus one of
them are not great news.

00:54:59.340 --> 00:55:01.090
And the final one
used to kill you.

00:55:01.090 --> 00:55:03.360
If the final one now
is the trait that

00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:05.570
is going to save
you, it is going

00:55:05.570 --> 00:55:08.730
to carry the weight of all
the other proteins that

00:55:08.730 --> 00:55:09.620
are changed.

00:55:09.620 --> 00:55:13.550
If you get what is called
an evolutionary bottleneck,

00:55:13.550 --> 00:55:19.040
if you get a circumstance of
such severe selection for such

00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:23.307
a tiny subset of traits,
that basically the rule is

00:55:23.307 --> 00:55:25.890
it doesn't matter-- if you have
that trait-- it doesn't matter

00:55:25.890 --> 00:55:27.825
how much of a network
you've changed,

00:55:27.825 --> 00:55:29.950
you're going to be one of
the ones who come through

00:55:29.950 --> 00:55:32.210
and everybody else does not.

00:55:32.210 --> 00:55:34.760
And the evolutionary
record is full of all sorts

00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:38.080
of circumstances where there
have been selective bottlenecks

00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:42.800
where 1% of a population comes
out the other end of it because

00:55:42.800 --> 00:55:46.810
of some rare trait that they
had which carries all the macro

00:55:46.810 --> 00:55:48.170
consequences of that.

00:55:48.170 --> 00:55:50.530
For example, there
was clearly some sort

00:55:50.530 --> 00:55:54.241
of bottleneck of selection that
went on with cheetahs about--

00:55:54.241 --> 00:55:56.240
I don't know, a couple
thousand years ago or so.

00:55:56.240 --> 00:55:58.620
People have estimated
more accurately.

00:55:58.620 --> 00:56:01.720
Because all the cheetahs
are so genetically

00:56:01.720 --> 00:56:05.390
similar to each other that
you can transplant tissue,

00:56:05.390 --> 00:56:08.470
you can graft tissue
from any cheetah on earth

00:56:08.470 --> 00:56:11.440
onto another one and there
will not be rejection.

00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:15.370
All of the cheetah on earth
are closely related descendants

00:56:15.370 --> 00:56:19.670
of what had to have been fairly
recently, a couple of thousand,

00:56:19.670 --> 00:56:24.480
a tidy, remnant population
that now is highly inbred

00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:27.710
and you had some sort
of selective bottleneck

00:56:27.710 --> 00:56:29.840
that went on at that time.

00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:32.940
Similarly, I can't remember
when in hominid history,

00:56:32.940 --> 00:56:35.730
but the suggestion was at
at least a couple of points

00:56:35.730 --> 00:56:37.700
in hominid evolution,
there have been

00:56:37.700 --> 00:56:43.960
points of selective bottlenecks
where glaciers or comets

00:56:43.960 --> 00:56:48.270
or knows what, where only a
small subset of individuals

00:56:48.270 --> 00:56:52.560
with some traits that have
been, up until then, neutral

00:56:52.560 --> 00:56:55.140
or are unlikely to be useful
because of these big macro

00:56:55.140 --> 00:56:58.310
consequences, suddenly
only the folks who had it

00:56:58.310 --> 00:56:59.810
came out the other end.

00:56:59.810 --> 00:57:02.030
What are we beginning
to describe here?

00:57:02.030 --> 00:57:05.360
Circumstances of rapid change.

00:57:05.360 --> 00:57:08.760
Circumstances of
punctuated radical change.

00:57:08.760 --> 00:57:11.300
There are circumstances
that begin

00:57:11.300 --> 00:57:14.790
to make conceivable
punctuated equilibrium.

00:57:14.790 --> 00:57:18.370
It's so intrinsic in
this huge complexity

00:57:18.370 --> 00:57:23.290
of macroevolutionary change in
DNA because of the structure

00:57:23.290 --> 00:57:26.230
intrinsic in it are
two critical things.

00:57:26.230 --> 00:57:28.750
One is the vast
majority of the time,

00:57:28.750 --> 00:57:31.810
make a change which
changes some whole network

00:57:31.810 --> 00:57:33.780
and it's going,
to be a disaster.

00:57:33.780 --> 00:57:36.760
The majority of the time,
there's going to be stasis.

00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:40.120
And also intrinsic in
that is the ability

00:57:40.120 --> 00:57:44.090
to have massive macro
changes, any of these examples

00:57:44.090 --> 00:57:45.970
we've had here,
where, in periods

00:57:45.970 --> 00:57:49.340
of selective bottlenecks,
you're going to get something

00:57:49.340 --> 00:57:51.390
like that happening.

00:57:51.390 --> 00:57:54.540
So Gould and friends
are absolutely right.

00:57:54.540 --> 00:57:55.640
All of that.

00:57:55.640 --> 00:57:56.940
Not necessarily.

00:57:56.940 --> 00:58:01.480
Because again, this radical
rapid change period, that's

00:58:01.480 --> 00:58:03.850
for paleontologists,
for biologists.

00:58:03.850 --> 00:58:06.990
That's thousands of
generations, in some cases.

00:58:06.990 --> 00:58:09.470
Again, what counts
as very rapid in one

00:58:09.470 --> 00:58:12.690
scientific discipline may not
be the same for the biologist

00:58:12.690 --> 00:58:13.530
at the other end.

00:58:13.530 --> 00:58:16.060
Nonetheless, this winds
up being a mechanism

00:58:16.060 --> 00:58:22.070
for long periods of spaces
and very rapid change.

00:58:22.070 --> 00:58:24.940
So that suggests that, where
we have these mechanisms.

00:58:24.940 --> 00:58:29.210
So how does one begin to resolve
the microevolutionary picture

00:58:29.210 --> 00:58:32.010
of gradualist social
biology from last week

00:58:32.010 --> 00:58:35.110
and the macro picture of
punctuated equilibrium

00:58:35.110 --> 00:58:36.340
drama, all of that?

00:58:36.340 --> 00:58:39.000
How do you begin to put
the pieces together?

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:40.820
A number of ways that
it could be done.

00:58:40.820 --> 00:58:43.550
Let me just see here.

00:58:43.550 --> 00:58:44.140
Yes.

00:58:44.140 --> 00:58:46.150
A number of ways
it could be done.

00:58:46.150 --> 00:58:50.210
One is thinking again about
micro mutational changes

00:58:50.210 --> 00:58:54.130
or about changes in the function
of preexisting proteins.

00:58:54.130 --> 00:58:57.260
And macro mutational changes
are about the invention

00:58:57.260 --> 00:59:01.160
of new proteins, new networks,
new, if/then clauses,

00:59:01.160 --> 00:59:04.010
all of that serving
different functions.

00:59:04.010 --> 00:59:05.870
Back to the difference
in the genome

00:59:05.870 --> 00:59:07.700
between humans and chimps.

00:59:07.700 --> 00:59:11.420
When you look at the micro
versus the macro differences,

00:59:11.420 --> 00:59:15.000
for example, in the domain
of the immune system,

00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:17.370
most of the differences
between humans and chimps

00:59:17.370 --> 00:59:21.450
genetically have to do with
microevolutionary differences.

00:59:21.450 --> 00:59:23.740
And that comes down
to clinical pictures

00:59:23.740 --> 00:59:27.850
that you see humans are much
more resistant to tuberculosis

00:59:27.850 --> 00:59:29.620
than chimps are.

00:59:29.620 --> 00:59:33.780
Chimps are much more resistant
to malaria than humans are.

00:59:33.780 --> 00:59:37.240
Nonetheless, it's the basic nuts
and bolts of the immune system

00:59:37.240 --> 00:59:37.850
there.

00:59:37.850 --> 00:59:40.200
One of these guys has a
little bit better of this,

00:59:40.200 --> 00:59:41.560
one has worse of that.

00:59:41.560 --> 00:59:44.290
This is within a realm
of gradualist change.

00:59:44.290 --> 00:59:46.740
The genetic differences
that explain that

00:59:46.740 --> 00:59:48.680
are microevolutionary ones.

00:59:48.680 --> 00:59:52.090
Where are the macro evolutionary
differences between humans

00:59:52.090 --> 00:59:53.420
and chimp genomes?

00:59:53.420 --> 00:59:56.610
Those are the ones that
have to do with development.

00:59:56.610 --> 01:00:00.540
And those are the ones that
amplify differences big time.

01:00:00.540 --> 01:00:02.800
You have one tiny little
difference and you

01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:06.550
get an organism that's going to
look as different from a chimp

01:00:06.550 --> 01:00:07.430
as a human does.

01:00:07.430 --> 01:00:10.750
The other way around, some
systems, their evolution

01:00:10.750 --> 01:00:14.170
is much more built driven by
micro changes, some much more

01:00:14.170 --> 01:00:14.780
than macro.

01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:17.220
Some of the most
interesting macro stuff

01:00:17.220 --> 01:00:19.760
is going to be
developmental blueprints,

01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:22.470
developmental trajectories.

01:00:22.470 --> 01:00:23.210
What else?

01:00:23.210 --> 01:00:25.160
What else in terms
of resolution?

01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:27.740
There are plenty
of fossil histories

01:00:27.740 --> 01:00:30.910
by now for some line that are
complete enough that it is

01:00:30.910 --> 01:00:33.570
very clear they look like this.

01:00:33.570 --> 01:00:35.900
And the majority
of fossil pedigrees

01:00:35.900 --> 01:00:40.140
that are that detailed enough
support a punctuated model.

01:00:40.140 --> 01:00:41.940
Nonetheless, there
are plenty that

01:00:41.940 --> 01:00:45.210
are understood with as many
time points in here that

01:00:45.210 --> 01:00:46.980
follow gradualist models.

01:00:46.980 --> 01:00:49.020
So evidence for both.

01:00:49.020 --> 01:00:52.320
Nonetheless mostly
punctuated evidence.

01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:55.220
The biggest problem though
in debating all of this

01:00:55.220 --> 01:00:57.940
is it is impossible
for the most part

01:00:57.940 --> 01:01:02.780
to see gradualism going
on, because it's gradual,

01:01:02.780 --> 01:01:05.120
because it's hard to spot that.

01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:08.390
It's hard to show whether
changes are incremental

01:01:08.390 --> 01:01:09.970
or changes are rapid.

01:01:09.970 --> 01:01:12.770
But by now, there
are a few examples

01:01:12.770 --> 01:01:15.790
where people have actually
been able to observe

01:01:15.790 --> 01:01:18.720
evolutionary changes
in organisms and ones

01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:21.050
that can count as fairly rapid.

01:01:21.050 --> 01:01:25.270
One first example-- for reasons
I cannot begin to understand,

01:01:25.270 --> 01:01:28.880
people in Chicago-- I don't know
if it's in the Chicago Field

01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:31.400
Museum or the mayor's
office or something--

01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:34.370
have all sorts of carcasses
around from rats killed

01:01:34.370 --> 01:01:37.670
in Chicago in the 1880s.

01:01:37.670 --> 01:01:40.330
Key to the city,
souvenirs, who knows what?

01:01:40.330 --> 01:01:41.570
Chicago's centennial.

01:01:41.570 --> 01:01:43.320
But those around
stored someplace.

01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:45.070
And a few years ago,
researchers were

01:01:45.070 --> 01:01:47.960
able to look at the
genomes of those beasts

01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:50.490
compared to rats
that are being taken

01:01:50.490 --> 01:01:53.340
these days off the streets
of Chicago, current ones,

01:01:53.340 --> 01:01:57.470
and showing over the course of
a century, a lot of the genome

01:01:57.470 --> 01:01:58.330
has evolved.

01:01:58.330 --> 01:02:00.390
There are a lot of differences.

01:02:00.390 --> 01:02:04.185
Over the course of a century--
I don't know, what is that?

01:02:04.185 --> 01:02:07.160
Maybe 500, 1,000
generations or so.

01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:10.170
There has been significant
change over that time.

01:02:10.170 --> 01:02:12.570
Darwin's finches,
for those of you

01:02:12.570 --> 01:02:15.810
Darwin history fans, that
started the whole thing.

01:02:15.810 --> 01:02:17.300
All sorts of different species.

01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:19.400
The finches found in
the Galapagos Islands

01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:21.520
and people have
been studying them

01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:24.220
for half a century,
three-quarters of a century.

01:02:24.220 --> 01:02:27.960
Gene distributions are
changing-- gene distributions

01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:30.570
for traits, like the
size of your bill

01:02:30.570 --> 01:02:33.470
and thus what kind of
food you could break into,

01:02:33.470 --> 01:02:36.120
in response to environmental
shifting there.

01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:37.700
That is being documented.

01:02:37.700 --> 01:02:39.300
That's going on.

01:02:39.300 --> 01:02:40.220
What else?

01:02:40.220 --> 01:02:43.130
Another one that is
really interesting

01:02:43.130 --> 01:02:45.340
and important and
critical for lots

01:02:45.340 --> 01:02:50.400
of us, which is the evolution
of resistance to diabetes.

01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:52.580
This is a very
interesting phenomenon.

01:02:52.580 --> 01:02:54.330
Diabetes comes in two forms.

01:02:54.330 --> 01:02:57.650
Juvenile onset diabetes-- that's
the one where you need insulin.

01:02:57.650 --> 01:03:00.180
The diabetes that's instead
becoming an epidemic

01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:03.150
is adult onset
diabetes, which is

01:03:03.150 --> 01:03:06.890
when you have a body
which is all built out

01:03:06.890 --> 01:03:10.860
of lean hominid history to
store away lots of calories

01:03:10.860 --> 01:03:13.880
and all of that, and you
throw in a westernized diet

01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:17.500
and you get the increasing
westernized problem of obesity.

01:03:17.500 --> 01:03:20.375
And you then wind
up getting diabetes.

01:03:20.375 --> 01:03:22.250
For our purposes right
now, it doesn't matter

01:03:22.250 --> 01:03:23.650
what diabetes looks like.

01:03:23.650 --> 01:03:26.360
The main thing is,
it is driven by food

01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:29.370
excesses in westernized diets.

01:03:29.370 --> 01:03:30.880
So there's been a
whole literature

01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:33.900
by now of people
studying populations

01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:38.020
that have had rapid shifts
from traditional diets

01:03:38.020 --> 01:03:39.560
to westernized diets.

01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:42.460
A lot of Pacific Islanders
have been studied.

01:03:42.460 --> 01:03:44.210
All sorts of other populations.

01:03:44.210 --> 01:03:47.270
The group that is the
iconic one to study

01:03:47.270 --> 01:03:49.910
is Native American
group in Arizona

01:03:49.910 --> 01:03:51.770
called the Pima Indians.

01:03:51.770 --> 01:03:54.600
And what's very convenient
about them is about half

01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:56.930
of them live in the United
States and about half

01:03:56.930 --> 01:03:57.800
in Mexico.

01:03:57.800 --> 01:04:01.100
And there has been very
rapid changes in diet

01:04:01.100 --> 01:04:04.240
in the American side, less so
in the Mexican one-- far more

01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:04.890
traditional.

01:04:04.890 --> 01:04:07.340
And one of the things
that soon emerged

01:04:07.340 --> 01:04:10.440
once westernized sort of
typical processed food

01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:13.960
became the predominant food
eaten by people in the Arizona

01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:20.380
side is 90% diabetes rates by
the time you're 30 years old.

01:04:20.380 --> 01:04:23.210
The exact same thing in
some of the Pacific Islands

01:04:23.210 --> 01:04:26.630
that have been studied,
in the Naru and Samoa

01:04:26.630 --> 01:04:28.190
and some of these other places.

01:04:28.190 --> 01:04:30.950
Astronomically high
rates of diabetes.

01:04:30.950 --> 01:04:33.110
Another population
where it's been studied

01:04:33.110 --> 01:04:36.510
are populations of Jews
who were living in Yemen

01:04:36.510 --> 01:04:39.210
and who-- I think in
the '60s or '70s--

01:04:39.210 --> 01:04:42.520
moved to Israel, switching
from a very traditional diet

01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:44.240
to a very westernized one.

01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:46.990
Diabetes rates absolutely
through the roof.

01:04:46.990 --> 01:04:50.480
What that's doing very
quickly was killing off

01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:54.400
all sorts of folks very early in
their reproductive life history

01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:55.160
periods.

01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:56.730
Suddenly you've
got the people who

01:04:56.730 --> 01:05:00.490
are most vulnerable to
diabetes when suddenly given

01:05:00.490 --> 01:05:02.300
a westernized diet,
they're leaving

01:05:02.300 --> 01:05:04.350
fewer copies of their genes.

01:05:04.350 --> 01:05:06.570
And it's been in the
last decade or so,

01:05:06.570 --> 01:05:08.730
some of the Pacific
island populations

01:05:08.730 --> 01:05:11.430
that have been studied,
the diabetes rates

01:05:11.430 --> 01:05:13.620
are beginning to go down.

01:05:13.620 --> 01:05:16.190
In other words, there has
been this selection that

01:05:16.190 --> 01:05:18.230
went into Western
European populations,

01:05:18.230 --> 01:05:21.310
I don't know, a
century or so, which

01:05:21.310 --> 01:05:24.520
is the folks who have the
most efficient metabolisms

01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:28.750
and can store away all of
those dozens of Hershey bars

01:05:28.750 --> 01:05:29.820
effortlessly.

01:05:29.820 --> 01:05:30.930
They're dead.

01:05:30.930 --> 01:05:33.460
And they died before they
left copies of their genes.

01:05:33.460 --> 01:05:36.600
You are now selecting
for human populations

01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:38.880
that have sloppier metabolisms.

01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:42.440
And this is within the
course of a century.

01:05:42.440 --> 01:05:43.430
Another example.

01:05:43.430 --> 01:05:46.720
Here's a totally, totally
cool, irresistible one.

01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:50.368
This is one of the
great genetics stories.

01:05:57.600 --> 01:06:04.200
As you can see, or not,
this pure white screen

01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:07.691
tells you that this is research
that went on in Siberia.

01:06:07.691 --> 01:06:08.540
[LAUGHTER]

01:06:08.540 --> 01:06:13.420
Actually, these were Siberian--
so this was a famous study done

01:06:13.420 --> 01:06:16.800
by this Soviet
geneticists starting,

01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:18.480
I don't know, about
50 years or so,

01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:21.390
where you have these
Siberian silver foxes.

01:06:21.390 --> 01:06:22.790
And that's what they look like.

01:06:22.790 --> 01:06:25.710
And for all sorts of
reasons, who knows what,

01:06:25.710 --> 01:06:28.350
it is highly valued
to have clothing made

01:06:28.350 --> 01:06:33.249
out of their bodies, and thus
highly valuable wild animals,

01:06:33.249 --> 01:06:33.790
tough to get.

01:06:33.790 --> 01:06:36.550
And this guy decided,
well, what we need to do

01:06:36.550 --> 01:06:40.650
is start some Siberian silver
fox domestication farming

01:06:40.650 --> 01:06:41.320
stuff.

01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:43.710
So he did a very logical thing.

01:06:43.710 --> 01:06:48.650
He started selectively
breeding them for tameness.

01:06:48.650 --> 01:06:52.260
He would have a bunch of captive
foxes that were wild born

01:06:52.260 --> 01:06:55.120
and most of them totally
feral and crazed.

01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:59.520
And he would see, is there
a subset, 5%, 10% of them,

01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:03.100
that I could get relatively
closer to that were calmer

01:07:03.100 --> 01:07:05.030
in the human's proximity?

01:07:05.030 --> 01:07:07.180
Only let those ones breed.

01:07:07.180 --> 01:07:11.100
Now take their offspring
and only take the 10% or so

01:07:11.100 --> 01:07:14.340
that are most calm,
most easily tamed.

01:07:14.340 --> 01:07:19.160
And it took about 35
generations or so to get foxes

01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:22.920
that were as tame as dogs are.

01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:25.910
Something else totally amazing.

01:07:25.910 --> 01:07:30.830
So he's breeding them for only
one trait-- a behavioral trait,

01:07:30.830 --> 01:07:34.000
which is the ability
to get close to them

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:37.140
if you're a human,
calmness on their part,

01:07:37.140 --> 01:07:38.930
whatever you might
describe it as.

01:07:38.930 --> 01:07:42.660
Breeding entirely
based on that trait.

01:07:42.660 --> 01:07:45.860
And when you spend 35
generations breeding

01:07:45.860 --> 01:07:48.720
a wild animal like
a fox so that it's

01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:51.700
the ones who are
most able to function

01:07:51.700 --> 01:07:54.050
in the role of
domesticated animals,

01:07:54.050 --> 01:07:56.560
it's not just the
behavior that changes.

01:07:56.560 --> 01:08:00.996
This is what the adults look
like 35 generations later.

01:08:00.996 --> 01:08:02.394
Aw!

01:08:02.394 --> 01:08:03.326
[LAUGHTER]

01:08:03.326 --> 01:08:06.020
Oh, give me one.

01:08:06.020 --> 01:08:06.810
Give me 100.

01:08:06.810 --> 01:08:09.920
I want-- yes.

01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:11.070
They're adorable.

01:08:11.070 --> 01:08:13.110
Can you believe how
great they look?

01:08:13.110 --> 01:08:14.960
What's going on here?

01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:17.569
They were selecting
for a behavioral trait,

01:08:17.569 --> 01:08:19.840
and they are fox puppies.

01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:22.700
They've got a big roundy
ears and these cute

01:08:22.700 --> 01:08:24.729
little short muzzle things.

01:08:24.729 --> 01:08:28.135
And they wag their tails
when humans show up.

01:08:28.135 --> 01:08:30.520
And these are not dog
descent into wolves.

01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:34.310
This was 35 generations to
turn something on to left

01:08:34.310 --> 01:08:36.060
into something
looking at the right.

01:08:36.060 --> 01:08:38.960
Very interesting thing we
will come to in the ethology

01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:39.710
lectures.

01:08:39.710 --> 01:08:42.170
Basically, what you're
breeding for when you're

01:08:42.170 --> 01:08:44.770
breeding a wild animal
to be tame-able,

01:08:44.770 --> 01:08:46.670
your breeding for
the ones that behave

01:08:46.670 --> 01:08:49.890
more childishly, the
ones who are acting more

01:08:49.890 --> 01:08:52.340
like developing
animals who are more

01:08:52.340 --> 01:08:54.270
dependent on other individuals.

01:08:54.270 --> 01:08:57.279
You're breeding them
for infantile traits.

01:08:57.279 --> 01:08:59.979
This is what a baby
fox looks like.

01:08:59.979 --> 01:09:03.270
This is what these
domesticated foxes look like.

01:09:03.270 --> 01:09:06.270
Totally amazing
that this happened.

01:09:06.270 --> 01:09:07.979
Ironic ending
department-- you will

01:09:07.979 --> 01:09:11.990
notice that the coat has changed
from the ones on the left

01:09:11.990 --> 01:09:14.529
to these wonderful
coats that you just

01:09:14.529 --> 01:09:17.779
want to have made into
underwear and hats and all

01:09:17.779 --> 01:09:19.069
of that sort of thing.

01:09:19.069 --> 01:09:23.350
And on the right, they
look like Spot and Rover

01:09:23.350 --> 01:09:24.819
and all those guys.

01:09:24.819 --> 01:09:28.069
It is called a piebald
coloration pattern.

01:09:28.069 --> 01:09:31.029
Somehow also, you can't
get the domestication

01:09:31.029 --> 01:09:32.270
without that happening.

01:09:32.270 --> 01:09:34.279
Ironic ending--
nobody wants to wear

01:09:34.279 --> 01:09:35.920
clothes that look like that.

01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:38.000
They would've been killing
Dalmatians for years

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:39.370
if that were desirable.

01:09:39.370 --> 01:09:41.410
In the process of
breeding them, they

01:09:41.410 --> 01:09:43.250
became useless economically.

01:09:43.250 --> 01:09:48.240
Nonetheless, totally
amazing demonstration.

01:09:48.240 --> 01:09:51.000
35 generations and
you turn something

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:52.580
on to left into
something looking

01:09:52.580 --> 01:09:55.270
like that on the right, who
will wag its tail like you would

01:09:55.270 --> 01:09:58.760
lick your face and bring your
chewed up slippers back to you.

01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:01.500
This is a very rapid change.

01:10:01.500 --> 01:10:02.870
Final example.

01:10:02.870 --> 01:10:07.040
This is one that is also
quite consequential,

01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:09.730
and one possibly even
more so than diabetes,

01:10:09.730 --> 01:10:11.880
which is if this
type of evolution

01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:15.050
keeps occurring at the rate
that it's happening, all of us

01:10:15.050 --> 01:10:17.440
are going to have
dramatically shortened life

01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:22.330
expectancies-- antibiotic
resistance in various bacteria.

01:10:22.330 --> 01:10:24.040
Evolution going on there.

01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:26.620
What we see in all
sorts of cases is,

01:10:26.620 --> 01:10:29.550
evolution is not just
occurring over the course

01:10:29.550 --> 01:10:32.000
of glacial lengths of time.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.530
It can be occurring
very rapidly.

01:10:34.530 --> 01:10:37.620
And what we see here
also is, in some cases,

01:10:37.620 --> 01:10:40.190
it's going to leave a
different sort of skeleton,

01:10:40.190 --> 01:10:43.830
changing how good your kidneys
and pancreases are dealing

01:10:43.830 --> 01:10:46.140
with westernized
food, that's not going

01:10:46.140 --> 01:10:47.800
to make for a different fossil.

01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:50.221
Breeding for antibiotic
resistance in bacteria

01:10:50.221 --> 01:10:52.220
is not going to make for
a different-- actually,

01:10:52.220 --> 01:10:55.080
can bacteria even make fossils?

01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:55.865
Does anybody know?

01:10:55.865 --> 01:10:56.365
Yes.

01:10:56.365 --> 01:10:57.210
Yes.

01:10:57.210 --> 01:11:00.110
So it's going to make bacterial
fossils that look exactly--

01:11:00.110 --> 01:11:03.570
all of this interesting
amazing stuff going on,

01:11:03.570 --> 01:11:08.490
and it's stuff that no
punctuated radical dogmatic

01:11:08.490 --> 01:11:12.310
paleontology type would
ever be able to pick up.

01:11:12.310 --> 01:11:13.930
So what are we heading to here?

01:11:13.930 --> 01:11:18.110
We're heading to a wonderful
heart-warming resolution

01:11:18.110 --> 01:11:20.940
of these different
schools of thought, which

01:11:20.940 --> 01:11:23.250
is, can't we all get along?

01:11:23.250 --> 01:11:25.400
And can't we all
have means of having

01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:29.010
different types of
evolution happening?

01:11:29.010 --> 01:11:32.780
So almost certainly harking
back to what mentioned before,

01:11:32.780 --> 01:11:36.040
microevolutionary
changes-- the immune system

01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:37.420
in chimps versus humans.

01:11:37.420 --> 01:11:39.780
Macroevolutionary
changes development.

01:11:39.780 --> 01:11:42.540
You don't have to choose
vanilla or chocolate.

01:11:42.540 --> 01:11:44.660
They could be going
on at the same time.

01:11:44.660 --> 01:11:46.540
And they could be going
on at the same time

01:11:46.540 --> 01:11:50.280
in a very important
resolving way, which

01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:55.180
is-- so you've got evidence
for a punctuated change

01:11:55.180 --> 01:11:56.360
of some trait.

01:11:56.360 --> 01:11:59.780
And single traits
don't evolve at a time.

01:11:59.780 --> 01:12:02.380
They come in whole
packages, packages

01:12:02.380 --> 01:12:04.430
making you wag
your tail and such.

01:12:04.430 --> 01:12:07.492
So there is some other
punctuated thing going on.

01:12:07.492 --> 01:12:10.200
And that's its pattern
happening there.

01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:12.900
And then meanwhile, you've
got some other trait moving,

01:12:12.900 --> 01:12:15.590
evolving in a punctuated manner.

01:12:15.590 --> 01:12:17.810
I guess it doesn't go down.

01:12:17.810 --> 01:12:19.930
And you put enough
of these together

01:12:19.930 --> 01:12:22.500
and have enough punctuated
events happening,

01:12:22.500 --> 01:12:25.660
and on a whole
population level, you've

01:12:25.660 --> 01:12:27.690
just invented gradualism.

01:12:27.690 --> 01:12:29.350
You don't have to choose.

01:12:29.350 --> 01:12:30.660
You can have it all.

01:12:30.660 --> 01:12:31.760
You can have it all.

01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:33.560
So a resolution there.

01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:35.890
Both are almost
certainly happening.

01:12:35.890 --> 01:12:37.680
So what does this
set us up for now?

01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:39.800
Now that we have
finished this bucket,

01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:43.630
we are now ready on
Friday-- what is today?

01:12:43.630 --> 01:12:44.130
Wednesday.

01:12:44.130 --> 01:12:46.920
We are now ready on Friday to
move to the next bucket, which

01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:50.380
is a very different world
of trying to make sense

01:12:50.380 --> 01:12:52.130
of the genetics of behavior.

01:12:52.130 --> 01:12:54.790
Last week's version,
you make up stories

01:12:54.790 --> 01:12:56.640
built around
individual selection,

01:12:56.640 --> 01:12:58.920
kin selection, group
selection, and come up

01:12:58.920 --> 01:13:00.662
with the best story
around to show

01:13:00.662 --> 01:13:01.870
me something more predictive.

01:13:01.870 --> 01:13:02.860
And you win.

01:13:02.860 --> 01:13:06.670
This week's version, showing
actual genetic changes

01:13:06.670 --> 01:13:08.020
over the course of time.

01:13:08.020 --> 01:13:10.770
What patterns of
evolutionary change

01:13:10.770 --> 01:13:13.200
will those code for
with what consequences

01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:17.150
for understanding the evolution
of behavior, competition,

01:13:17.150 --> 01:13:19.090
reproductive
strategies, all of that?

01:13:19.090 --> 01:13:21.050
By the end of this
week, switching over

01:13:21.050 --> 01:13:24.290
instead to the world of
behavior geneticists, where

01:13:24.290 --> 01:13:27.070
they try to understand
what's going on by looking

01:13:27.070 --> 01:13:30.200
at-- so somebody gets adopted.

01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:33.290
Do they share a trait more
with their adoptive parents

01:13:33.290 --> 01:13:35.340
or their biological parents?

01:13:35.340 --> 01:13:38.870
You look at identical twins
versus non-identical ones.

01:13:38.870 --> 01:13:41.600
You look at identical
twins who were adopted

01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:44.790
into different families right at
birth, put them back together.

01:13:44.790 --> 01:13:47.280
A whole world of trying
to make sense that way.

01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:49.190
And what we'll see
is the same deal

01:13:49.190 --> 01:13:52.410
is with this-- what counts
as finishing, coming up

01:13:52.410 --> 01:13:55.010
with an explanation--
last week's social biology

01:13:55.010 --> 01:13:56.900
approaches-- this
version of this

01:13:56.900 --> 01:13:59.620
is the starting point
for the next discipline.

01:13:59.620 --> 01:14:02.400
So we'll pick up
on that on Friday.

01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:02.990
Oh, my god.

01:14:02.990 --> 01:14:04.600
He let us out--

01:14:04.600 --> 01:14:07.850

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.930
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:05.941
Stanford University.

00:00:08.647 --> 00:00:10.928
[SIDE CONVERSATIONS]

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.230
OK, let's get going.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:19.260
Let's see.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.690
First off, apologies for Friday.

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.440
Sometimes, what seems
like a flawless set

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.130
of connecting flights on paper
turn out not to be in reality.

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.130
So hopefully, people made
good use of the time.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:32.900
OK.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.120
We are ready for our next
bucket, our next bucket,

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.780
our third one in this
series, just in time

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.520
to convince you that we
just keep jumping these.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.330
As soon as you get accustomed
to one approach, here

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.260
we are, yet another
one, where we

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.041
are going to trash everything
that's come before us.

00:00:49.041 --> 00:00:49.540
OK.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.690
What have been the two
broad approaches so far?

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.060
The first one, the
sociobiological/evolutionary

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.100
psychology one--
behavior evolves

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.740
exactly under the same sort
of wind tunnel of selection

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.550
as does the heart of
a giraffe, blah, blah,

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:06.710
that whole song and dance.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.550
Following certain
rules, you could

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.140
generate fairly
structured predictions

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.860
about social behavior.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.710
And then, the we-win
version of using that is,

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:17.940
here's what we predict.

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.460
Here is the way we explain
this complex system

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.170
of social behavior,
using these rules which

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.940
assume certain degrees of
heritability of behavior,

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.740
following certain
rules of evolution.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.840
And until you come up
with a better explanation

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.970
for how this goes on, we win.

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.070
This is how behavior works.

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.410
Then we shifted over
to the molecular end.

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:42.940
And what we saw was, on a
certain sort of trendy level,

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.430
molecular biology is the
answer to the people who

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.310
would sit around to
the sociobiologists

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.230
and say, show me the genes.

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:50.920
Show me the genes
for what you keep

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.720
talking about inferentially.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.500
And what we saw was how
evolutionary change works out

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:57.590
in the DNA level.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.420
Very importantly,
the common mechanisms

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.830
for microevolutionary
change and how that supports

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.500
the picture of gradualism.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.889
And then seeing all of these
relatively new, unexpected ways

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:12.230
in which you are getting
big time changes in DNA,

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.840
all these amplifying
effects of macroevolution,

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.880
and suddenly support for
punctuated equilibrium

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.180
in two ways.

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.900
The first one being,
as soon as you

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.320
get one, little, tiny mutation
affecting transcription

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.570
factors, affecting
splicing enzymes,

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.840
affecting entire
networks, it is going

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.780
to be real rare
that you don't get

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.850
a mutation that's a disaster.

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.440
Stabilizing.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.070
Stasis, that's the
long-term feature

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:40.950
of the punctuated equilibrium.

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.420
The equilibrium part
and the punctuated

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.450
seeing how, under circumstances
of extreme selection,

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.130
something that is come up with
is wildly adaptive, wildly

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.100
advantageous, quickly
fixates in the society.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.731
And thus, we have
step functions.

00:02:56.731 --> 00:02:57.230
OK.

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.100
So what we do today--
and Wednesday is now

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.880
shift to another field--
thinking about behavior

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.530
in a genetic context,
in a heritable context,

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.610
this whole field of
behavior genetics.

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.510
And what you'll see is,
depending on your stripe,

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.480
either these are a bunch of
really powerful approaches

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.570
for being able to infer some
sort of genetic components

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.470
to behavior, often getting
a whole lot of insight

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.080
into what's going on,
and in some cases,

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.450
a more negative view,
more critical one,

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.900
the entire field is gibberish.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.230
And a way to summarize the
view of it as being gibberish

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.280
was this great cartoon
I saw a while back.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.100
OK, two scientists are
standing around the lab.

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:41.720
And they've got
their lab coats on,

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.850
and their test tubes, and going
about doing science stuff.

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.750
And one of them is
saying to the other one,

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.910
you know how sometimes you're
on the phone with someone,

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:51.860
and you've been talking
for a long time,

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.160
and it seems like they
decide they want to get off,

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.160
but they don't want to
say they want to get off,

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.537
so they say, I probably
shouldn't keep you any longer,

00:03:58.537 --> 00:04:00.620
even though you're not the
one wanting to get off,

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.494
because they're the one
who wants to get off?

00:04:02.494 --> 00:04:05.178
Well, I think I found
the gene for that.

00:04:05.178 --> 00:04:06.126
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:06.126 --> 00:04:09.420
And that winds up being one of
the criticisms of the behavior

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:10.000
genetics.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.330
Once again, this world of
inferring genetic bases

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:19.390
to behavior in often the most
deterministic possible way

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:23.490
and using techniques which
are often complete nonsense.

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.280
And what we'll see are the
tools of behavior geneticists,

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.030
and all the criticisms,
and why this winds up

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:30.890
being a very contentious field.

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:31.410
OK.

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.930
So this being another version
of getting at, how do you

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.530
know when a behavior
has a genetic component.

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.200
And we're immediately
allowing ourselves

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.720
to be a little more subtle
here, not determined by genes,

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.020
not determined purely by nature.

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.960
All of that merely to
have a genetic component,

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.130
a genetic influence, how
do you begin to do that?

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.890
And this is a world where
people, the scientists,

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:58.960
don't sit around coming up
with evolutionary models.

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.710
They don't sit around trying
to find mutations in genes.

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.550
They have a very different
sort of strategy.

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.190
They look for patterns
of shared traits

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.390
among the individuals who
have differing degrees

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:16.470
of shared genes and
infer, related to this,

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:19.360
and infer genetic
influences from that.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.490
OK, what's the simplest most
mindless version of doing this?

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:25.960
The basic initial
rules, centuries ago,

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.440
when behavior genetics
started , was the notion,

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.090
if you see a trait that
is universal in a species,

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:33.910
obviously, it's genetic.

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:35.500
Obviously, it's hard-wired.

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.250
Obviously, it's instinctual.

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:40.270
Obviously, that's an
extremely limited approach.

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:41.070
Yes, indeed.

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:43.910
You will see some
species, like flies,

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:46.520
in which certain behavioral
traits are determined

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:50.060
by relatively small numbers
of genes and are universal.

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:51.940
This is obviously
going to fall apart

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.910
when you get to something
more interesting than a fly.

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:57.090
So what's a much more
the starting point

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:00.820
for the whole field
is to say, ooh, look.

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:05.490
Here's some behavioral
traits that run in families.

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:07.140
Genes run in families.

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:09.100
Therefore, we may have
just found evidence

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:11.550
for a genetic influence
on these traits.

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:13.190
And of course, it
takes about an eighth

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:16.400
of a second to come up with the
retort to that, which is, yes,

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:20.010
genes run in families, but
environment runs in families

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:21.380
as well.

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.240
So the standard
response is to now

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.480
put a little bit more
strictures on it,

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:29.070
to say, OK, it's not just
that genes run in families,

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:32.930
but as we know, from a few weeks
ago, the more closely related

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:35.630
you are, the more genes
you share in common.

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:38.320
Our Mendelian rule
of half the genes

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:39.960
with full sibling, et cetera.

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:44.450
Following thus, the logic that,
if you have a behavioral trait

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:47.970
that becomes more common
the more closely related two

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:51.170
individuals are, now
you're inferring something

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:52.620
about genetics.

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:55.570
And of course, the
problem there is not only,

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:58.690
as you become more closely
related to somebody,

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:01.450
do you share a greater
percentage of your genes,

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:03.420
you share environment more.

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:06.850
Obviously, you are sharing
environment on the average,

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:09.550
in most cases, much
more with a sibling than

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:12.030
with a first cousin, than
with an eighth cousin.

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:15.440
The trouble is shared genes
and shared environment

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:17.370
tend to co-variant families.

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:21.380
So that greatly weakens what
was the initial classic approach

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:24.080
to the field 70, 80 years ago.

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:24.740
OK.

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:26.740
So you've got to come up
with something fancier,

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:29.220
something more informative,
something more subtle.

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:31.550
And what you wind
up doing then is,

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:33.870
let's control for environment.

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:35.630
Yes, obviously,
the eighth cousin

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:38.220
is living in a different
world than your full sibling.

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:41.560
Let's control for environment
under circumstances

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:44.020
where you examine
relatives where

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:46.550
they have the same
environment, and they

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:49.980
differ in terms of the
amount of genes they share.

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:52.300
And what is this
classic approach?

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:57.200
Look at identical twins
versus fraternal twins,

00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:03.020
monozygotic twins, from one
zygote, monozygotic, identical

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:06.840
twins versus dizygotic.

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:10.540
And the general notion there
is, OK, identical twins

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:13.090
share 100% of their genes.

00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:17.140
Fraternal twins share
50% of their genes.

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:22.960
So if identical twins are raised
in the exact same environment,

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:27.000
and fraternal twins are raised
in the exact same environment,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.120
they all have
environments shared.

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:31.520
What's the only
difference then to explain

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:33.909
any behavioral
differences, if you

00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:36.799
see a trait that is
shared to a greater

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:41.539
extent in a pair of identical
twins, than in fraternal twins?

00:08:41.539 --> 00:08:42.669
What's the only difference?

00:08:42.669 --> 00:08:44.870
They all grow up with
identical environments.

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:48.030
It's because the identical
twins have twice the amount

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:50.390
of genes in common, 100%.

00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:55.010
You could thus infer a genetic
influence on that trait,

00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:57.410
because it's the
identical environment.

00:08:57.410 --> 00:08:59.720
Twins get raised
absolutely the same.

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:01.850
And the only difference
is the degree

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:04.380
of relatedness, the
degree of shared

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:08.200
genes between monozygotic
and dizygotic twins.

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:11.620
That one should take about
2/8 of a second to demolish,

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:13.770
for the simple
starting point that,

00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:16.940
oh, yeah, sometimes fraternal
twins, dizygotic twins,

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:18.850
are different sexes.

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:19.350
OK.

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:20.570
So that complicates things.

00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:23.200
So you come back and you're a
little bit more rigorous now.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:26.490
And you restrict your
comparisons of monozygotic

00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:31.050
to dizygotic, to
same-sex dizygotic pairs.

00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:33.060
And then you
institute this rule,

00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:36.980
OK, same-sex twins, whether
identical or fraternal,

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:39.450
are raised essentially
in the same environment.

00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:40.540
The same environment.

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:43.950
So if you see a greater
sharing of traits

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:47.100
among the monozygotic
twins than the dizygotic,

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:50.590
the only place that greater
sharing could be attributed to

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:53.940
is the fact that they
have more genes in common.

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:54.440
Ah.

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:57.450
We have just identified
a behavior that

00:09:57.450 --> 00:10:00.250
has a strong genetic component.

00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:02.060
So the big problem
with that approach

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:05.830
is-- anyone-- who's
a twin in here?

00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:06.594
Whoa.

00:10:06.594 --> 00:10:07.510
That's a lot of hands.

00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:10.290
Identical twins?

00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:13.280
Dizygotic twins?

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:13.880
Any triplets?

00:10:16.891 --> 00:10:17.390
OK.

00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:20.250
Just to extend that,
armadillos always

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:23.652
give birth to four
identical offspring at once.

00:10:23.652 --> 00:10:26.351
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:26.351 --> 00:10:26.850
OK.

00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:27.410
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:31.160
So that having been prompted,
what we then move on to

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:34.300
is the obvious problem
with this entire approach.

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:35.120
Hurray.

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:39.290
Monozygotic twins get raised in
virtually the same environment.

00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:41.720
Dizygotic twins
of the same gender

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:43.880
get raised in virtually
the same environment.

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:46.010
That's not true
in the slightest.

00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:48.830
There is far more
differentiation of environment

00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:52.610
for dizygotic twins than
for monozygotic twins.

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:55.950
They are treated
differently, as pairs.

00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:58.480
Thus, if behavioral
traits are more in

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:02.080
common between monozygotic
twins than between dizygotic,

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:05.250
it could be because these guys
share more genes in common,

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:08.920
and/or because they share
more environment, a completely

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:11.400
flawed approach in that regard.

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:13.370
The next complication.

00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:16.750
It turns out, monozygotic
twins don't always

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:18.860
have the exact same environment.

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:19.640
Well, yes.

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:22.720
Obviously, one of them gets
sneezed on at a higher rate

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:24.730
by a kid sister, or something.

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:28.040
And that's going to produce just
decades worth of consequences.

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:31.460
But even in other
domains, monozygotic twins

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:35.610
don't get treated exactly the
same, in some circumstances.

00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:40.511
And here is what it looks
like, if I had drawn it.

00:11:40.511 --> 00:11:41.010
OK.

00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:45.580
So you've got your twins.

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:47.410
And this is during fetal life.

00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:51.280
And there are fetuses in there.

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:56.590
And OK, there's one with
a little thing of hair.

00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:58.960
And there's the other.

00:11:58.960 --> 00:11:59.900
OK.

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:04.230
And what you have
is a placenta forms.

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:05.260
And here's the deal.

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:11.470
With monozygotic twins, if they
split during the first five

00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:14.260
days after conception,
they wind up,

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.930
each one, with
their own placenta.

00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:20.560
On the other hand, if the
split occurs between days five

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:24.710
and 10, there's already
commitment to one placenta,

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:26.730
which they then share.

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:33.280
So monochorionic
pregnancy, or bichorionic.

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:35.390
And what does that
wind up meaning?

00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:38.380
In the monochorionic,
the two fetuses

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:41.410
share a blood stream,
to a greater extent,

00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:44.110
than in the bichorionic
circumstance.

00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:48.120
In these cases, it's
separate blood flow from mom.

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:50.220
OK, it's still the same
mom, and it's still

00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:52.530
ultimately the same
blood, but it's

00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:55.370
going to be subtle differences
in the levels of stuff

00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:56.480
in the bloodstream.

00:12:56.480 --> 00:13:01.160
With the monochorionic, the
environment for these fetuses

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:03.570
are much more similar,
in terms of whatever

00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:05.390
is carried in the bloodstream.

00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:06.500
OK, great.

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:08.050
That's a great factoid.

00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:10.930
And that's like interesting,
things about identical twins.

00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:13.520
But like different
levels of nutrients,

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:16.220
whether it's coming off
of a blood vessel here,

00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:18.930
versus there, OK, maybe
that makes a difference.

00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:21.120
But these are going to
be minuscule differences.

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:22.310
Nothing interesting.

00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:27.380
As one example of it,
monochorionic identical twins

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:32.930
have more similar IQs than do
bichorionic identical twins.

00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:36.490
Just one demonstration that
this could make a difference.

00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:38.120
This is relevant.

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:40.430
The IQs are more similar.

00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:44.080
And this has been one reason
why marmoset monkeys-- marmoset

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:46.630
monkeys, pair
bonding, so you know

00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:48.830
what they're all about--
among other things,

00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:51.570
marmoset monkey mothers
always give birth

00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:54.430
to twins, because there is
two parents around to take

00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:55.130
care of them.

00:13:55.130 --> 00:13:58.680
And it's got a completely
screwy circulatory system

00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:01.300
for the twins that are
unlike either of these.

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:03.100
And there's all sorts
of people who've

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:05.540
been interested in
marmosets over the years--

00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:08.470
the ones who couldn't afford
to by themselves armadillos--

00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:13.240
interested in terms of looking
at the differences in blood

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:16.190
flow during fetal
life there of twins.

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:16.690
OK.

00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:20.180
So we start off here that,
just because you see something

00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:21.770
more in common in
monozygotic twins

00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:23.920
than dizygotic, that
doesn't tell you

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:26.470
the first thing about
whether it's genes involved.

00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:28.660
They share our
environment much more.

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:30.400
Then even trying to
make sense of what's

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:32.570
going on in monozygotic.

00:14:32.570 --> 00:14:35.220
What you've got there
are fundamental potential

00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:37.530
differences,
environment, starting

00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:40.610
at a very important
early state of life.

00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:43.870
So monochorionic
versus bichorionic.

00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:45.320
What else then?

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:51.450
How about another one where you
can look at a behavioral trait,

00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:53.980
looking at traits and
traits differences,

00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:56.920
according to some
genetic trait and where

00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:58.730
environment is the same?

00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:01.090
How about gender differences?

00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:02.030
Whoa.

00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:02.540
OK.

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:04.890
So genes have something
to do with producing

00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:06.147
what your gender is.

00:15:06.147 --> 00:15:09.200
And environment being
the same, if you

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:11.340
see differences between
females and males,

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:14.410
that's attributable to
the different genetics.

00:15:14.410 --> 00:15:15.150
OK.

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:18.120
And you should be able to nuke
that one within seconds, as

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:20.960
well, which is the
notion of shared

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:23.780
environment, the notion
of identical environmental

00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:24.770
experience.

00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:26.850
To give you a sense
of how subtle this

00:15:26.850 --> 00:15:32.030
is, at one hour of life, on the
average, the level of activity,

00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:35.270
the rate of movement, the
amount of movement of limbs,

00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:38.520
on the average, is
greater among newborn boys

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:40.560
than newborn girls.

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:41.540
Whoa.

00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:46.940
That's there like within
an hour of getting born.

00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:48.870
That's not a whole lot
of time for environment

00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:49.950
having gone on there.

00:15:49.950 --> 00:15:52.680
Maybe you're seeing a
strong genetic effect.

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:55.980
What other studies have shown
is, from the first moments

00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:59.360
of post-natal life,
mothers are already

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:03.430
interacting differently with
baby girls than with baby boys.

00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:07.130
From the first interaction, from
the very first holding of them,

00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:09.780
there's differences in
how long they are held.

00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:12.400
There are differences in
proximity to the body,

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:13.460
to the face.

00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:14.690
So Whoa.

00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:17.170
Sex differences in
behavior at one hour.

00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:20.550
Sex differences in environment
within mere moments

00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:22.240
after being born.

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:24.200
So that weakens that one.

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:26.740
And this came through
in another realm.

00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:29.390
This was a study that was
done in the '80s, that

00:16:29.390 --> 00:16:34.150
was enormously influential, by
a pair of scientists at Johns

00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:36.720
Hopkins, Benbow and Stanley.

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:39.800
And it had to do with a program
that I'd bet a lot of you

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:41.900
guys had something or
other to do with back

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:47.190
when, which is the Johns
Hopkins Gifted Youth Program

00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:49.870
thing, which I bet
all sorts of you

00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:51.940
guys qualified for
at various points

00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:55.290
and got the Johns Hopkins
blue ribbons pasted

00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:56.340
to your forehead.

00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:59.150
And that was part of
this massive study that's

00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:02.670
been going on for decades
and decades of kids who

00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:05.067
are very gifted,
academically, and in a number

00:17:05.067 --> 00:17:05.900
of different realms.

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:08.849
And Benbow and Stanley were
some of the senior researchers

00:17:08.849 --> 00:17:09.880
on this.

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:12.520
And this was a study
they did when they had

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:15.200
40,000 kids in their database.

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:17.359
And they asked a
very simple question,

00:17:17.359 --> 00:17:21.099
which was, well, what
does IQ distribution

00:17:21.099 --> 00:17:25.940
look like in this population as
a function of what sex you are?

00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:29.940
And back came a very
interesting finding,

00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:33.710
which was a highly, highly,
highly significant difference

00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:37.510
in the average IQ
between girls and boys,

00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:41.350
in the direction of
boys having a higher IQ.

00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:45.520
Moreover, when you looked at
the tail of the distribution,

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:48.540
the highest IQ
range, what you saw

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:54.650
there was approximately a 13:1
ratio, way out at this extreme.

00:17:54.650 --> 00:17:57.900
They then followed up and did
the exact same thing-- no,

00:17:57.900 --> 00:17:59.320
they didn't do IQ.

00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:00.320
What am I talking about?

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:02.430
They did math.

00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:03.150
Ignore that.

00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:04.010
Erase all of that.

00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:05.130
OK, let's start over.

00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:05.630
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:10.660
So lots of you probably got the
Benbow and Stanley sweatshirts

00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:12.180
when you were part
of that program.

00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:16.010
So they were looking at math
skills, yes, junior high school

00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:18.930
kids who were taking the
math part of the SATs.

00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:22.880
That's part of getting
into this Hopkins program.

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:26.530
So they took the math SATs and
they looked at those 40,000

00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:29.560
scores and saw that
there was a gender

00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:32.800
difference in the average
score on the math SATs,

00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:34.630
with boys scoring higher.

00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:36.710
Not only that, but
when they looked out

00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:39.800
at the tail here-- OK, I'm back
on track-- when they looked out

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:42.250
at the tail here at the
highest math achievement,

00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:46.220
there was a ratio of
13:1, boys to girls

00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:48.800
OK, so that was pretty striking.

00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:51.560
And in their paper, which
was published in Science,

00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:54.080
was a very, very
critical phrase.

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:57.320
Their rationale for
doing this study on kids

00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:59.450
that age was the
fact that-- at least,

00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:01.620
at the time in most
schools, middle school,

00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:05.680
junior high school-- kids have
not differentiated classes yet.

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:07.110
They're not yet
at the point where

00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:10.560
you could choose to take
extra math classes, to choose

00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:12.220
to take the absolute minimum.

00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:15.370
This was still the stage where
most kids in this country

00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:17.650
are getting the exact
same math classes.

00:19:17.650 --> 00:19:19.840
Everyone is still
getting the same.

00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:23.360
And thus, at that point, they
could include in their paper

00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:27.460
a phrase along the lines of,
since all the children had

00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:31.800
essentially identical
educational environments,

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:35.600
any gender differences
seen in it are reflecting--

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:37.800
and they used the
word, "biological"--

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:40.760
are reflecting
biological differences.

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:44.500
This was one hell
of a famous study.

00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:47.950
This was front page
all over the place.

00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:52.960
This wound up being shown in
a very large article in Time,

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:55.680
and in Newsweek, the
Reader's Digest--

00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:58.150
which I know, sort of,
everyone is supposed

00:19:58.150 --> 00:20:00.750
to make fun of-- but the
Reader's Digest, at least--

00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:02.150
does it still exist?

00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:02.650
Yes.

00:20:02.650 --> 00:20:03.450
Yes, it does.

00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:03.950
OK.

00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:06.330
Throughout the 1980s,
the Reader's Digest

00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:08.340
was the most widely
read magazine

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:10.590
in this country,
which is astonishing,

00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:13.240
showing what percentage of
people read in the bathroom,

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:15.890
so having to go with the
Reader's Digest there.

00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:20.660
And the Reader's Digest covered
this and used the phrase,

00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:24.200
"The math gene,"
and discussing how

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:27.760
this was the definitive study
showing that more boys have

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:30.150
the "math gene."

00:20:30.150 --> 00:20:32.610
Like, you already know
that's like nonsense

00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:34.780
on so many different levels.

00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:36.430
But this was all over the place.

00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:38.690
This was the study
that definitively

00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:43.470
showed genetic differences
in math skills by sex,

00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:47.600
and definitively showed that
this was manifest at a stage

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:50.500
before there were different
educational environments,

00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:51.950
in terms of math.

00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:54.530
And what, of course,
completely rips apart

00:20:54.530 --> 00:20:57.630
that study-- and it was shameful
that thing was ever published,

00:20:57.630 --> 00:20:59.420
let alone got as
much attention as it

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:02.930
did-- is the fact that the
environment was not exactly

00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:03.570
the same.

00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:06.570
Endless number of studies
have shown, beginning

00:21:06.570 --> 00:21:09.470
by first grade, if
it is a simple math

00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:12.280
problem at that stage for
the same hands put up,

00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:15.640
a boy is more likely to
be called on than a girl.

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:18.430
Studies showing that, for
the same correct answer,

00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:20.330
boys in elementary
schools are more

00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:23.840
likely to be praised for the
correct answer than are girls.

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:27.100
By the time junior high
school is coming around,

00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:29.740
guidance counselors are
already differentially,

00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:33.080
by sex, advising, once
you get into high school,

00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:35.160
to take more elective math.

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:38.670
Tremendous, massive
differences in environment.

00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:41.760
And this study, using
this whole argument of,

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:43.990
if there's an
identical environment,

00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:47.060
and you see differences,
it's due to genes.

00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:49.340
And predicated on
that, if that's not

00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:52.550
true in our afterlife,
it was ludicrous

00:21:52.550 --> 00:21:55.370
that they were making this
argument about 13-year-olds.

00:21:55.370 --> 00:21:58.700
So this was a paper
with enormous influence

00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:01.420
in every major newspaper
in the country.

00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:05.220
Scientists have discovered
the "math gene."

00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:08.300
And boys have them
more than girls.

00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:11.010
We will come back to
that study later on,

00:22:11.010 --> 00:22:14.080
because something much, much
more interesting was going on.

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:14.720
OK.

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:18.660
So those were the limits in
the sex difference end of it.

00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:20.490
So what can you do next?

00:22:20.490 --> 00:22:22.840
There's a flip side,
another approach,

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:25.110
that the behavior
geneticists use, which

00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:26.850
is basically the converse.

00:22:26.850 --> 00:22:29.440
Now, you look at
individuals getting

00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:35.370
raised in the same environment
who don't share genes.

00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:38.240
Same environment,
different genes.

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:40.370
Rather than just now
the different genes,

00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:43.520
same environment nonsense
about gender differences,

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:46.500
even down to monozygotic
twins, all of that,

00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:48.915
but now the flip
side, same environment

00:22:48.915 --> 00:22:50.950
and different genes.

00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:53.150
What was the paradigm for this?

00:22:53.150 --> 00:22:55.800
The one that is used over,
and over, and over again,

00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:58.100
the standard approach in
this part of the field

00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:00.860
is adoption studies.

00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:04.580
You take someone who
is adopted as a child,

00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:08.280
and they are now raised
in a household of people

00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:11.990
who they are not related to,
their adoptive, non-biological

00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:12.900
parents.

00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:14.580
And what you now
begin to look at

00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:17.110
are patterns of shared traits.

00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:19.790
Specifically, what
is looked at is,

00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:23.360
when you see a trait in
someone who was adopted,

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:26.510
who are they more likely
to share that trait with?

00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:30.220
Their biological
parents, or parent?

00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:33.270
Or with an adoptive parent?

00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:35.900
Now, the logic of this is
completely straightforward.

00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:38.860
And this has been sort of the
standard paradigm in animal

00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:41.870
studies of the genetics
of behavior for centuries,

00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:43.950
something called
cross-fostering.

00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:48.710
You take a newborn litter
and another newborn litter,

00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:51.750
and you switch them
between moms so that they

00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:53.105
were raised by different moms.

00:23:53.105 --> 00:23:57.140
And they're raised with, thus,
someone they're not related to,

00:23:57.140 --> 00:24:01.280
but someone who they now have
environmental shared with them.

00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:03.700
Or in the litter
cross-fostering studies,

00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:05.930
you will take half of
a litter and switch it

00:24:05.930 --> 00:24:10.310
to another mother, half-- so
you see how the iterations there

00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:10.870
go.

00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:12.920
So that was essentially
the rationale

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:15.060
for how this would
be done in humans.

00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:18.560
And this was the
basis of one study

00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:21.410
in the late '60s,
early '70s, which

00:24:21.410 --> 00:24:26.910
was the landmark study
in genetic psychiatry,

00:24:26.910 --> 00:24:29.900
in behavioral genetics as a
whole, a study carried out

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:33.390
by a guy at Harvard,
named Seymour Kety.

00:24:33.390 --> 00:24:38.620
And this was a phenomenal study
and phenomenally important.

00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:40.130
Here's what Kety did.

00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:44.740
Kety was dealing with the
notion at the time of making

00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:46.370
sense of schizophrenia.

00:24:46.370 --> 00:24:49.290
And as we will see when we get
to the schizophrenia lecture,

00:24:49.290 --> 00:24:51.930
the number of nutty
ideas out there as

00:24:51.930 --> 00:24:55.430
to what the cause of this
disease is is just staggering.

00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:57.350
But what he was
interested in was

00:24:57.350 --> 00:25:01.130
getting at the notion that
was kind of floating around

00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:03.570
in some corners of the
field at the time, which

00:25:03.570 --> 00:25:06.950
is schizophrenia has a
biological component,

00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:08.750
a genetic component.

00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:12.470
And what that was was
viewed as very unlikely.

00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:15.850
But what Kety did was
try to go and test this.

00:25:15.850 --> 00:25:17.590
So what's he going to do?

00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:20.850
He's going to look at
adopted individuals who

00:25:20.850 --> 00:25:23.160
are schizophrenic
and see are they

00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:26.170
more likely to share that
trait with a biological parent

00:25:26.170 --> 00:25:27.100
or adoptive parent.

00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:28.730
You see the logic already.

00:25:28.730 --> 00:25:31.730
OK, how many
schizophrenic adoptees

00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:33.970
are you going to find
out there where you also

00:25:33.970 --> 00:25:36.760
were able to figure out who
the biological parents were.

00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:38.530
This was not an easy task.

00:25:38.530 --> 00:25:41.270
And Kety's insight,
his intuition,

00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:44.620
was to go to one of the places
on Earth where that was most

00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:47.590
easily done, which
is Scandinavia,

00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:51.390
where all the Scandinavian
countries keep records like you

00:25:51.390 --> 00:25:54.190
cannot believe about
everything on Earth.

00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:56.230
People understanding,
for example,

00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:59.310
how the age of
puberty onset in girls

00:25:59.310 --> 00:26:01.420
have been decreasing
for centuries.

00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:03.790
They're always using
Scandinavian data,

00:26:03.790 --> 00:26:06.720
because every single thing
that could possibly be recorded

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:09.200
has been written down and
stored someplace there

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:11.120
in moth-proof vaults.

00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:14.730
And what he was able to do in
ways that no human subjects

00:26:14.730 --> 00:26:16.880
committee on earth would
approve these days,

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:21.970
is go through the entire
database of adoptees in Denmark

00:26:21.970 --> 00:26:26.930
and identify all of the cases
where somebody adopted had

00:26:26.930 --> 00:26:29.450
wound up with
schizophrenia, and then

00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:32.760
able to go back and see
who the biological parents

00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:34.630
and the adoptive parents were.

00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:37.360
Was a staggeringly large study.

00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:41.670
He and a team of psychiatrists
spent years in Denmark

00:26:41.670 --> 00:26:44.050
doing this, because one
of the things they did

00:26:44.050 --> 00:26:45.770
was they then did follow-ups.

00:26:45.770 --> 00:26:48.670
And they themselves
interviewed all

00:26:48.670 --> 00:26:51.470
of the potentially
schizophrenic individuals

00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:52.990
on there, so that
they would have

00:26:52.990 --> 00:26:56.760
the same diagnostic standards
all across the board.

00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:58.650
As we'll see in the
schizophrenia lecture,

00:26:58.650 --> 00:27:01.230
it's a very squishy diagnosis.

00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:04.740
So having the same
psychiatrists interviewing

00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:08.590
every possible person,
hugely important control.

00:27:08.590 --> 00:27:10.790
This is part of what took
them years and years.

00:27:10.790 --> 00:27:13.180
And then they finally
were able to say

00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:16.100
what the patterns
of similarity were.

00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:18.160
And here's what they
wound up saying.

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:21.320
You take any random
person on the street who

00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:25.010
is schizophrenic, and you
take any other random person

00:27:25.010 --> 00:27:27.630
off the street, and you
ask what are the odds

00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:29.980
that the second person
shares this trait

00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:31.420
with the first person?

00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:33.500
About 1% likelihood.

00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:35.610
What's that another
way of stating?

00:27:35.610 --> 00:27:37.280
In the population
as a whole, there's

00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:41.180
about a 1% incidence
of schizophrenia.

00:27:41.180 --> 00:27:43.570
So you start with
the circumstance

00:27:43.570 --> 00:27:47.310
where the biological
parents, neither of them

00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:51.790
had schizophrenia, and neither
of the adoptive parents do.

00:27:51.790 --> 00:27:54.880
And what's the incidence in
this population among adoptees?

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:57.220
A 1% schizophrenia rate.

00:27:57.220 --> 00:27:59.880
That's just average
people off the street.

00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:03.890
That's the usual rate across
Western European population.

00:28:03.890 --> 00:28:05.470
So 1% rate.

00:28:05.470 --> 00:28:09.380
Now, let's have the
person growing up

00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:11.120
in a different
sort of household.

00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:14.710
This is a person who
has no biological legacy

00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:16.930
of schizophrenia,
but was brought up

00:28:16.930 --> 00:28:21.700
in an adoptive household
with a schizophrenic parent.

00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:25.340
And what you saw
then was a 3% chance,

00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:27.630
which, with this
enormous sample size,

00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:30.910
was a highly significant,
reliable number.

00:28:30.910 --> 00:28:35.230
So in a rough kind of way,
being raised in a household

00:28:35.230 --> 00:28:37.740
with an adoptive parent
who is schizophrenic

00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:42.450
approximately triples your risk
of a schizophrenia diagnosis.

00:28:42.450 --> 00:28:46.020
But then, the really
critical one, which is you

00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:48.610
were raised in a household
where neither parent,

00:28:48.610 --> 00:28:50.710
adoptive parent,
is schizophrenic,

00:28:50.710 --> 00:28:55.260
but you have a biological legacy
among your biological parents

00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:56.400
of schizophrenia.

00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:57.960
What do you see?

00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:01.090
A 9% incidence.

00:29:01.090 --> 00:29:05.260
Approximately a three-fold
increase above that, almost

00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:07.830
a 10-fold difference
now over what you

00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:09.780
see in the general population.

00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:13.670
This one number was what
roared through the field.

00:29:13.670 --> 00:29:15.900
This was viewed as
the clearest evidence

00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:20.680
to date for a genetic component
to a psychiatric disorder.

00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:23.730
Regular old person off
the street, 1% rate.

00:29:23.730 --> 00:29:26.350
Have a biological parent
with schizophrenia

00:29:26.350 --> 00:29:29.460
and share no environment with
them, because you got adopted

00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:33.740
away, and almost 10-fold higher
chance of getting the disease.

00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:37.900
Then, final thing, looking at
the incredibly rare people who

00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:40.760
got screwed on more different
fronts than you can imagine,

00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:44.680
who had a biological parent
with schizophrenia, and phew,

00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:47.114
got out of there, and landed
in an adoptive household

00:29:47.114 --> 00:29:48.280
with a schizophrenic parent.

00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:48.780
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:50.760
So you get the
double whammy there.

00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:54.330
And what you saw
was a 17% incidence.

00:29:54.330 --> 00:29:57.280
What's interesting
about that number?

00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:00.670
OK, what this cell does,
what this number does,

00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:03.500
is reflect the
increased risk by having

00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:05.710
a biological legacy
of schizophrenia,

00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:07.610
plus the increased
risk of having

00:30:07.610 --> 00:30:10.479
an adoptive environmental
legacy of schizophrenia.

00:30:10.479 --> 00:30:11.020
So let's see.

00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:13.074
What's the difference
between 1 and 3?

00:30:13.074 --> 00:30:14.060
That's 2.

00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:16.430
So the difference between
1 and 9, that's 8.

00:30:16.430 --> 00:30:20.270
So thus, it should be
about 10 percentage points.

00:30:20.270 --> 00:30:22.420
It should be about a 10% rate.

00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:23.830
What are you seeing here?

00:30:23.830 --> 00:30:25.440
A synergism.

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:29.150
Get yourself a biological
legacy and get yourself

00:30:29.150 --> 00:30:31.700
a schizophrenia
household to grow up in,

00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:36.030
and it is not just adding
the two degrees of risk.

00:30:36.030 --> 00:30:39.470
There was a synergism, a
non-additive synergism.

00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:42.660
That is an important hint
for us of stuff to come.

00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:45.080
So this was this landmark study.

00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:48.310
This was phenomenally
difficult to have pulled off.

00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:51.700
It got Kety a number of
Nobel Prize nominations.

00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:56.040
This was the study that showed
the first definitive modern

00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:59.220
science evidence for
a heritable basis

00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:01.060
to a psychiatric disorder.

00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:03.680
And this became
the gold standard

00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:06.520
for how to do behavioral
genetic studies.

00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:08.650
And in the aftermath
of that, people

00:31:08.650 --> 00:31:12.500
began to do adoptive
studies on heritability

00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:14.930
between biological and
adoptive households,

00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:20.220
heritability of depression,
heritability of alcoholism,

00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:22.940
heritability of criminality.

00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:25.270
And you can see heading
off in all sorts

00:31:25.270 --> 00:31:28.270
of interesting directions
from there all sorts

00:31:28.270 --> 00:31:30.800
of interesting ones, and
them always producing

00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:34.910
a number that would be higher
in this cell of the matrix

00:31:34.910 --> 00:31:37.650
than that cell, and always
producing the notion

00:31:37.650 --> 00:31:41.840
that one has just shown a
strong genetic component

00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:43.620
to whatever that trait is.

00:31:43.620 --> 00:31:46.130
That trait-- IQ.

00:31:46.130 --> 00:31:48.310
That trait-- criminal behavior.

00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:50.200
That trait-- alcoholism.

00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:52.970
These were some
very loaded studies,

00:31:52.970 --> 00:31:55.280
in terms of the implications.

00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:58.890
So what is the problem
with that approach?

00:31:58.890 --> 00:32:00.250
A number of problems.

00:32:00.250 --> 00:32:04.310
The first one is that, under
the best of circumstances--

00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:07.370
best of circumstances, best
of circumstances for people

00:32:07.370 --> 00:32:09.140
trying to publish
papers out of this--

00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:11.580
under the cleanest
of circumstances,

00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:14.620
the individuals in the
study were adopted away,

00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:17.960
were taken from the biological
parents, a quarter of a second

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:19.420
after being born.

00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:22.550
No postnatal shared
environment whatsoever.

00:32:22.550 --> 00:32:24.590
What one knows, of
course, is that's not

00:32:24.590 --> 00:32:26.170
the case with adoption.

00:32:26.170 --> 00:32:29.620
And there's varying amounts
of lag time before it occurs.

00:32:29.620 --> 00:32:33.260
And they were never able to
factor that into the analyses.

00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:36.720
OK, so environment-- so
you've got two and a half days

00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:39.320
worth of environment with
your biological parents

00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:40.790
at the beginning there.

00:32:40.790 --> 00:32:43.700
OK, so that's a confound
"give me a break, though."

00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:46.170
Just a couple of days, that's
going to explain differences

00:32:46.170 --> 00:32:47.130
like these?

00:32:47.130 --> 00:32:49.670
What, of course, is
also linking around

00:32:49.670 --> 00:32:53.080
in there is the
huge, whopping topic

00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:59.290
of prenatal affects, prenatal
environment shared with mom.

00:32:59.290 --> 00:33:01.350
And we're about to
see in a little while

00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:04.260
some absolutely
astonishing realms

00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:08.620
in which prenatal environment
has very long-term effects.

00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:10.870
OK, so that's a huge confound.

00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:13.380
So how could you
control for that?

00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:17.530
You see a trait that an
individual shares in common

00:33:17.530 --> 00:33:21.760
with a biological parent,
despite being adopted away

00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:23.670
a second after
birth, all of that.

00:33:23.670 --> 00:33:25.840
And thus, you can infer
there's a biological,

00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:28.310
there's a genetic
component to this trait.

00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:28.820
Uh-oh.

00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:29.412
Wait a second.

00:33:29.412 --> 00:33:30.870
Shared environment
with the mother,

00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:34.000
that may explain some
of the shared traits.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.970
How do you get by that then?

00:33:35.970 --> 00:33:40.430
The difference in the likelihood
of sharing a biological trait,

00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:42.690
a trait with a
biological mother,

00:33:42.690 --> 00:33:46.080
versus a biological
father, is the measure

00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:48.170
then of the prenatal effect.

00:33:48.170 --> 00:33:53.670
If a trait is shared 10% with
the biological father and 17%

00:33:53.670 --> 00:33:56.100
with the biological
mother, the 7%

00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:58.760
is attributable to
prenatal effects.

00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:01.120
That was the general
conclusion that the field

00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:04.780
made at that point for dealing
with this irksome little

00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:08.710
problem, this pesky little thing
of prenatal environment, which

00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:11.270
is going to come back big
time in a few minutes.

00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:13.800
That was how they
were distinguished.

00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:16.639
So some more problems
with that approach.

00:34:16.639 --> 00:34:21.750
One is one that absolutely
tortures behavior geneticists

00:34:21.750 --> 00:34:24.570
the world over, one
which makes them just

00:34:24.570 --> 00:34:27.350
want to have people
being inbred strains

00:34:27.350 --> 00:34:30.929
where they could keep them in
cages and keep track of them.

00:34:30.929 --> 00:34:35.805
The problem being that, often,
the guy saying he's the father

00:34:35.805 --> 00:34:38.370
ain't actually the father.

00:34:38.370 --> 00:34:41.320
Oh, issues of
paternity uncertainty.

00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:43.740
That sure screws up
your genetic studies,

00:34:43.740 --> 00:34:46.239
if you're trying to attribute
stuff to someone who turns out

00:34:46.239 --> 00:34:47.610
not to be related.

00:34:47.610 --> 00:34:51.460
Very much higher rates than
the people at Reader's Digest

00:34:51.460 --> 00:34:54.639
would have you believe, the rate
at which the person claiming

00:34:54.639 --> 00:34:57.710
to be the father is not
actually the biological father.

00:34:57.710 --> 00:34:59.110
OK, that's a bummer.

00:34:59.110 --> 00:35:01.090
That makes things
more complicated.

00:35:01.090 --> 00:35:05.190
One other big confound
in the adoption approach.

00:35:05.190 --> 00:35:07.840
And this was something that
was emphasized by a guy

00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:10.870
at Princeton, Leon Kamin,
a psychologist there,

00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:15.100
doing a very good job of
showing that adoptive family

00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:18.370
placements were non-random.

00:35:18.370 --> 00:35:21.440
When a child is adopted,
you don't sit there

00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:23.570
and close your eyes
and spin the globe

00:35:23.570 --> 00:35:25.510
and put your finger
down in some place,

00:35:25.510 --> 00:35:28.600
and two minutes later this kid
born in, like, Shaker Heights,

00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:31.830
is running around with some
camel herders in Rajasthan.

00:35:31.830 --> 00:35:33.360
This is not done.

00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:35.830
It is not random placement.

00:35:35.830 --> 00:35:40.060
Instead, what is a policy in
virtually every adoptive agency

00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:42.680
in this country
is to try to match

00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:45.640
the kids, as much as
possible, along a number

00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:47.120
of different domains.

00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:52.380
In other words, you are also
sharing a lot of biology

00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:53.980
with the adoptive parents.

00:35:53.980 --> 00:35:57.170
And that completely
screws up the analyses.

00:35:57.170 --> 00:36:00.630
Adoption is non-random,
how it is done.

00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:02.810
One does not just
spin the globe.

00:36:02.810 --> 00:36:06.280
And instead, there are
very intentional attempts

00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:09.750
to try to match for certain
traits, traits which have

00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:12.090
genetic influences on them.

00:36:12.090 --> 00:36:12.780
OK.

00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:14.680
So that's a big problem.

00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:18.110
So the adoptive approach
had tons and tons

00:36:18.110 --> 00:36:20.810
of interesting findings,
enormously influential.

00:36:20.810 --> 00:36:23.990
But over the years, people
have realized, more and more,

00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:27.190
prenatal effects,
paternity uncertainty.

00:36:27.190 --> 00:36:31.070
And from day one, being pointed
out that adoptive parents

00:36:31.070 --> 00:36:36.150
have higher than random rates of
shared genes with the adoptees,

00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:39.000
in most cases, in this country.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:39.710
OK.

00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:41.850
So what becomes
the next approach?

00:36:41.850 --> 00:36:45.690
And this one wound up
being the gold standard,

00:36:45.690 --> 00:36:49.300
the high watermark, of how
to do behavior genetics.

00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:52.810
Behavior geneticists who are
able to do this sort of study,

00:36:52.810 --> 00:36:54.640
the rest of the
behavior geneticists

00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:58.090
hate them, because they've
got the best toys out there

00:36:58.090 --> 00:36:59.060
to play with.

00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:00.951
And they've got the
coolest things going.

00:37:00.951 --> 00:37:02.700
And they're always
snotty, because they've

00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:05.940
got the best possible
circumstance, the most perfect

00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:11.170
thing you can imagine, which
is identical twins separated

00:37:11.170 --> 00:37:13.440
at birth.

00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:14.010
Whoa.

00:37:14.010 --> 00:37:16.430
That must be one hell of an
experiment to have pulled off,

00:37:16.430 --> 00:37:18.440
identical twins
separated at birth.

00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:22.330
It turns out, every now and
then, a pair of identical twins

00:37:22.330 --> 00:37:24.795
are adopted very
soon after birth

00:37:24.795 --> 00:37:28.710
where each one is adopted
into a different household.

00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:30.250
Perfect.

00:37:30.250 --> 00:37:31.230
Perfect.

00:37:31.230 --> 00:37:33.260
Different environments,
different households,

00:37:33.260 --> 00:37:36.790
identical genes, you could
not possibly ask for something

00:37:36.790 --> 00:37:37.960
better than that.

00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:41.150
People, like, wet their pants
when the identical twins

00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:44.400
separated at birth paradigm
burst on the scene.

00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:46.220
This was so wonderful.

00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:48.680
People wrote poems
about identical twins

00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:50.750
separated at birth, sonnets.

00:37:50.750 --> 00:37:51.810
It was the best.

00:37:51.810 --> 00:37:53.980
It was so informative,
because look

00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:55.750
at the power of this approach.

00:37:55.750 --> 00:37:58.560
This is an incredibly
powerful approach.

00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:01.800
The two individuals are raised
in different environments,

00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:05.390
but they've got the
exact same genes.

00:38:05.390 --> 00:38:07.850
So the question
becomes, where are you

00:38:07.850 --> 00:38:10.730
going to find identical
twins separated at birth?

00:38:10.730 --> 00:38:12.960
And there's one obsessive
geneticist, behavior

00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:16.210
geneticist, University of
Minnesota, Tom Bouchard,

00:38:16.210 --> 00:38:19.610
has done an entire career not
only studying these folks,

00:38:19.610 --> 00:38:22.180
but God knows how he
finds these people.

00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:24.330
But he first started
publishing when

00:38:24.330 --> 00:38:27.960
he had 40 pairs of identical
twins separated at birth

00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:30.010
re-united in adulthood.

00:38:30.010 --> 00:38:32.680
And that made for some
incredible, bizarre,

00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:35.060
heartwarming stories
of discovering

00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:39.170
your long-lost identical sibling
and produced a mountain's worth

00:38:39.170 --> 00:38:40.890
of data.

00:38:40.890 --> 00:38:44.270
It was a bizarre
literature from day one.

00:38:44.270 --> 00:38:48.020
First one being, that you would
get the perfect case there.

00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:50.740
And what these guys would be
reporting in the literature

00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:52.760
was totally nutty stuff.

00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:55.680
OK, so you've got one of these
pairs of identical twins.

00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:56.970
And they're born.

00:38:56.970 --> 00:39:03.820
And Wolfie winds up being
raised in Uruguay by neo-Nazis.

00:39:03.820 --> 00:39:07.466
And Shmuel gets raised in
Israel by his highly orthodox

00:39:07.466 --> 00:39:07.965
whatevers.

00:39:07.965 --> 00:39:08.464
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:08.464 --> 00:39:12.880
And then, as a result of
a game show quirk of fate,

00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:14.880
they're suddenly
brought back together.

00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:18.740
And there is Wolfie and Shmuel,
who are identical twins.

00:39:18.740 --> 00:39:20.310
And what do they report?

00:39:20.310 --> 00:39:23.240
The most amazing thing
they have in common,

00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:25.850
they both flush the toilet
both before and after they

00:39:25.850 --> 00:39:26.790
go to the toilet.

00:39:26.790 --> 00:39:27.410
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:27.410 --> 00:39:29.300
You think I'm being facetious.

00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:31.910
Go back to that literature
when that first came out

00:39:31.910 --> 00:39:33.420
and the coverage in the press.

00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:37.710
And it would be things like,
Wolfie and Shmuel, they both

00:39:37.710 --> 00:39:42.660
have, like, a
poodle named Fluffy.

00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:45.760
And the flushing the toilet
before and after going

00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:49.640
to the bathroom, that was one
of the landmark early findings

00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:50.680
of these studies.

00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:52.660
They would find twins
that would do that.

00:39:52.660 --> 00:39:55.590
They would find twins who
were both married to somebody

00:39:55.590 --> 00:39:59.337
named Congolia, or something.

00:39:59.337 --> 00:39:59.836
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:59.836 --> 00:40:02.540
And they'd, oh, my god.

00:40:02.540 --> 00:40:04.300
This is totally amazing.

00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:07.720
That was what hit
the pages, initially,

00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:10.960
these obscure, little,
bizarre similarities

00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:13.370
within a backdrop
of, well, what's

00:40:13.370 --> 00:40:15.080
the data actually showing?

00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:18.690
And what's by now a twin
registry of probably a couple

00:40:18.690 --> 00:40:20.440
of hundreds sets
of these twins--

00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:24.390
and this has become the cottage
industry of the best behavior

00:40:24.390 --> 00:40:27.790
genetics around-- what has
come out of that literature is

00:40:27.790 --> 00:40:32.450
the most solid, reliable
findings is about 50%

00:40:32.450 --> 00:40:35.830
heritability of IQ.

00:40:35.830 --> 00:40:39.480
About 50% heritability
of where you

00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:44.650
are on the introversion,
extroversion scale, and about

00:40:44.650 --> 00:40:49.410
50% heritability for
degree of aggression.

00:40:49.410 --> 00:40:51.290
That's kind of interesting.

00:40:51.290 --> 00:40:54.700
And what we will see is
there's all sorts of problems

00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:56.340
with this approach as well.

00:40:56.340 --> 00:40:58.660
First one being,
starting right off,

00:40:58.660 --> 00:41:01.170
back to that Kamin
guy from Princeton,

00:41:01.170 --> 00:41:02.810
his critique-- turns
out there were not

00:41:02.810 --> 00:41:05.090
a whole lot of
Wolfies and Shmuels.

00:41:05.090 --> 00:41:07.580
Even though they got adopted
into different families,

00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:11.310
there again was the non-random
placement in families,

00:41:11.310 --> 00:41:13.660
more similar environments
than one would have

00:41:13.660 --> 00:41:16.080
anticipated purely by chance.

00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:18.130
So that is a confound.

00:41:18.130 --> 00:41:20.710
OK, so what's the
solution for that one?

00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:21.510
I know.

00:41:21.510 --> 00:41:24.760
Let's look at monozygotic
twins separated at birth

00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:27.910
and reunited on Oprah
at age 50, and then

00:41:27.910 --> 00:41:30.720
look at dizygotic twins
separated at birth

00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:33.390
and reunited after the
commercial break on Oprah,

00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:35.530
and see what similarities are.

00:41:35.530 --> 00:41:39.440
And if you see more things in
common with the monozygotics,

00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:41.010
rather than the
dizygotics, you've

00:41:41.010 --> 00:41:44.020
just controlled for the
non-random placement

00:41:44.020 --> 00:41:45.520
in the adoptive homes.

00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:47.710
The extent to which
the monozygotics

00:41:47.710 --> 00:41:51.900
have traits more in common
than the dizygotics, that

00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:53.990
reflects the identical genes.

00:41:53.990 --> 00:41:55.840
That was the interpretation.

00:41:55.840 --> 00:41:59.370
That was a very powerful
sort of analysis,

00:41:59.370 --> 00:42:02.890
one that, nonetheless,
winds up being very limited.

00:42:02.890 --> 00:42:06.270
Because in this case,
because of tiny sample size,

00:42:06.270 --> 00:42:09.480
it's really hard to
have done those studies.

00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:12.340
What's another feature of
the whole behavior genetics

00:42:12.340 --> 00:42:13.170
approach?

00:42:13.170 --> 00:42:14.340
Here's another one.

00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:18.110
If you see traits that
occur, behavioral traits,

00:42:18.110 --> 00:42:21.910
in the absence of any
learning, in the absence

00:42:21.910 --> 00:42:26.700
of any environmental experience,
in the absence of anything that

00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:31.170
can count as being
non-genetic, if you see that,

00:42:31.170 --> 00:42:33.440
you're looking at a
genetic influence.

00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:36.150
And what are the examples
that are always given?

00:42:36.150 --> 00:42:39.430
The fact that all babies
all over the universe

00:42:39.430 --> 00:42:43.450
start smiling, and they use
the exact same set of muscles.

00:42:43.450 --> 00:42:46.190
And they always start smiling
socially around, roughly,

00:42:46.190 --> 00:42:47.470
the same age.

00:42:47.470 --> 00:42:50.450
And what you also
see-- I don't want

00:42:50.450 --> 00:42:53.820
to know how these were done--
but these classic photographs

00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:57.580
that you can get filming
of kids in utero--

00:42:57.580 --> 00:43:00.690
I don't know what fiber
optic something or other

00:43:00.690 --> 00:43:02.920
was doing that-- but
the demonstration

00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:04.740
that fetuses smile.

00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:07.220
Fetuses smile during
the third trimester.

00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:11.590
This is a motoric pattern that
is shared among all humans.

00:43:11.590 --> 00:43:12.090
OK.

00:43:12.090 --> 00:43:16.460
Well, social smiling,
you see the flaw there,

00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:20.680
which is that is very subject
to shaping of behavior.

00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:22.660
You are three months
old, and you're

00:43:22.660 --> 00:43:25.880
watching all this social smiling
going on around you, and how

00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:28.410
the mannequins they have
at home are nowhere near as

00:43:28.410 --> 00:43:30.700
interesting as the
animated faces there.

00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:32.520
And you sort of try
it out yourself.

00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:36.090
What you see it's the exact
same developmental time

00:43:36.090 --> 00:43:40.560
course for smiling among
congenitally blind babies,

00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:43.640
babies who never
see anybody smiling.

00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:46.500
So you see the
motor pattern here

00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:51.010
being something that is
arguably fairly universal

00:43:51.010 --> 00:43:54.280
and occurring in the absence
of any sort of training,

00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:56.180
how you go about smiling.

00:43:56.180 --> 00:43:58.140
The other example
that's always used

00:43:58.140 --> 00:44:00.910
is with congenitally
deaf babies.

00:44:00.910 --> 00:44:04.720
And what you get there is
another universal, which

00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:08.180
is beginning to babble
at the exact same age

00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:10.540
that hearing kids
begin to babble,

00:44:10.540 --> 00:44:13.670
and the same argument
being made there.

00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:18.560
Of course, you have a very
uphill task there of ruling out

00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:20.770
any environmental similarities.

00:44:20.770 --> 00:44:23.640
Because once again,
once again, an area

00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:25.990
that has been utterly
under-appreciated

00:44:25.990 --> 00:44:28.190
in this whole field
is the whole world

00:44:28.190 --> 00:44:31.050
of prenatal
environmental effects.

00:44:31.050 --> 00:44:34.570
And the theme that's going to
come out of that is environment

00:44:34.570 --> 00:44:36.280
does not begin at birth.

00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:39.120
And some environmental
effects prenatally

00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:42.800
are enormously
influential forever after.

00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:45.520
And if you showed up
on the scene one second

00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:48.100
after that individual
was born, all

00:44:48.100 --> 00:44:50.550
of the tools of modern
behavior genetics

00:44:50.550 --> 00:44:52.070
would tell you that
you were looking

00:44:52.070 --> 00:44:54.650
at a genetic trait,
where it is one instead

00:44:54.650 --> 00:44:57.640
that was brought about by
the prenatal environment.

00:44:57.640 --> 00:44:59.200
OK, let's take a
five-minute break,

00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:01.710
and then we will
pick up on that.

00:45:01.710 --> 00:45:02.390
--good ones.

00:45:02.390 --> 00:45:04.860
First one being going back
to that gender difference

00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:07.910
business, the assumption
running through the field

00:45:07.910 --> 00:45:11.770
that, OK, boys and girls are
raised in the same environment

00:45:11.770 --> 00:45:12.770
by their parents.

00:45:12.770 --> 00:45:15.480
And the only thing that
differs is the genes.

00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:18.070
Like even those people,
behavior geneticists,

00:45:18.070 --> 00:45:19.700
believe that could be the case.

00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:22.900
No, they recognized this
was a very limited approach,

00:45:22.900 --> 00:45:25.280
and thus would limit
themselves to circumstances

00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:28.580
like the first hour of
post-natal life, which

00:45:28.580 --> 00:45:30.880
we already saw is a
flawed assumption,

00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:33.560
or under circumstances
where everybody's

00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:36.870
had the same number
of math problems

00:45:36.870 --> 00:45:39.620
to take in their first
12 years of life.

00:45:39.620 --> 00:45:41.290
And we see the
problem with that.

00:45:41.290 --> 00:45:43.040
Nonetheless, there
was the recognition

00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:45.510
that that was a very
limited set of tools

00:45:45.510 --> 00:45:46.790
for getting at these issues.

00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:48.670
The other useful thing
that was brought up

00:45:48.670 --> 00:45:52.340
was somebody pointing out
that, in the extended notes

00:45:52.340 --> 00:45:56.702
for behavior genetics, in the
second paragraph, somewhere

00:45:56.702 --> 00:45:58.410
in there, about the
fourth or fifth line,

00:45:58.410 --> 00:46:02.520
is the very clearly
typed out word, "unable."

00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:05.480
And pointing out that,
actually, the word

00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:06.750
was supposed to be "able."

00:46:06.750 --> 00:46:08.750
So you might want to
take a look at that

00:46:08.750 --> 00:46:11.060
and kind of keep
that one in mind.

00:46:11.060 --> 00:46:13.150
OK, perhaps I should
take a look at it also.

00:46:13.150 --> 00:46:13.920
Moving on.

00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:17.170
Moving on now to this
business, all of the approaches

00:46:17.170 --> 00:46:18.880
we've been seeing
about comparing

00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:20.520
monozygotic with dizygotic.

00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:24.130
By the way, with the
identical twins, 2/3 of them

00:46:24.130 --> 00:46:25.700
have monochorionic.

00:46:25.700 --> 00:46:28.070
1/3 are split.

00:46:28.070 --> 00:46:31.030
And how many of you who are
identical twins absolutely

00:46:31.030 --> 00:46:33.380
know in your heart of
heart right now whether you

00:46:33.380 --> 00:46:38.310
were a monochorionic
or bichorionic twin?

00:46:38.310 --> 00:46:38.830
OK.

00:46:38.830 --> 00:46:41.200
Well, that didn't
work very well.

00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:42.150
OK.

00:46:42.150 --> 00:46:43.730
So pushing on.

00:46:43.730 --> 00:46:46.650
What we see here is, with
all of these approaches,

00:46:46.650 --> 00:46:50.120
the adoption, the twins
separated at birth,

00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:52.830
the twins, mono versus
dizygotic, et cetera,

00:46:52.830 --> 00:46:55.100
et cetera, all of
those were predicated

00:46:55.100 --> 00:46:57.650
on one simple
assumption, which is,

00:46:57.650 --> 00:47:00.230
environment begins at birth.

00:47:00.230 --> 00:47:03.030
And that has been
completely destroyed

00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:06.920
in some incredibly interesting
ways in recent years.

00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:09.700
We have very vibrant
literature at this point.

00:47:09.700 --> 00:47:12.050
First way that it
can go down, which

00:47:12.050 --> 00:47:14.110
is your prenatal environment.

00:47:14.110 --> 00:47:16.750
What are you having as
a prenatal environment?

00:47:16.750 --> 00:47:18.920
Who are you sharing
environment with?

00:47:18.920 --> 00:47:20.730
Obviously, with your mother.

00:47:20.730 --> 00:47:22.620
You are sharing blood.

00:47:22.620 --> 00:47:25.780
You are sharing blood,
and thus the things

00:47:25.780 --> 00:47:29.320
that she is experiencing in
the world around her that

00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:32.410
make for a different environment
than the person standing

00:47:32.410 --> 00:47:36.610
next to her gets translated
into effects on the fetus.

00:47:36.610 --> 00:47:39.670
First domain, hormonal ones.

00:47:39.670 --> 00:47:43.790
Here's one example of something
that you will wind up seeing.

00:47:43.790 --> 00:47:46.720
This was worked on by a
guy named, Fred Vom Saal,

00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:49.800
at University of Missouri.

00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:52.070
And what he did was
look at the fact

00:47:52.070 --> 00:47:55.350
that rats give birth to
litters of about a dozen kids

00:47:55.350 --> 00:47:56.230
at a time.

00:47:56.230 --> 00:47:59.440
And there's some
circulatory system thing.

00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:03.060
They look like a whole
necklace of fetuses there.

00:48:03.060 --> 00:48:05.620
And the circulatory
system is such

00:48:05.620 --> 00:48:07.900
that everybody's getting
blood, but you're

00:48:07.900 --> 00:48:10.650
getting preferentially
the blood that

00:48:10.650 --> 00:48:13.150
is from the siblings
right around you.

00:48:13.150 --> 00:48:14.910
There's some sort
of looping thing

00:48:14.910 --> 00:48:17.340
that occurs with the blood
system that looks just

00:48:17.340 --> 00:48:17.980
like that.

00:48:17.980 --> 00:48:22.070
And what you wind up getting is
you have a particularly shared

00:48:22.070 --> 00:48:25.960
blood environment with the
siblings on either side of you.

00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:28.230
And what he asked was
something very simple.

00:48:28.230 --> 00:48:30.830
You are a female rat fetus.

00:48:30.830 --> 00:48:33.280
And in one case,
you're sitting there

00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:36.360
with brothers on each side.

00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:38.940
In another case,
one brother and one

00:48:38.940 --> 00:48:42.810
sister, or in the final case,
obviously, with two sisters

00:48:42.810 --> 00:48:43.800
on either side.

00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:46.670
And what you wind up getting
is a different hormonal

00:48:46.670 --> 00:48:47.680
environment.

00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:49.830
How does that
translate out later?

00:48:49.830 --> 00:48:53.590
The more male siblings you
have around you as a fetus,

00:48:53.590 --> 00:48:56.350
the later you're going
to reach puberty.

00:48:56.350 --> 00:49:01.010
That's interesting, suggesting
that very local endocrine

00:49:01.010 --> 00:49:04.380
effects here play out
in something like that.

00:49:04.380 --> 00:49:07.610
Also, it predicts how
estrogen levels are going

00:49:07.610 --> 00:49:09.630
to drop in you later in life.

00:49:09.630 --> 00:49:12.620
So this winds up being
one very interesting

00:49:12.620 --> 00:49:14.460
prenatal environment.

00:49:14.460 --> 00:49:15.860
Here's another one.

00:49:15.860 --> 00:49:20.690
Here we have, in humans,
the age of one's mother

00:49:20.690 --> 00:49:24.270
when she gave birth-- and
extrapolating a little bit here

00:49:24.270 --> 00:49:27.690
at both ends, but just assume
this is kind of the age range.

00:49:27.690 --> 00:49:31.540
And what we see here is
the age of puberty onset

00:49:31.540 --> 00:49:33.050
in the offspring.

00:49:33.050 --> 00:49:37.510
And what is seen is very young
mothers and very old mothers

00:49:37.510 --> 00:49:41.350
have offspring who reach
puberty later than women

00:49:41.350 --> 00:49:43.400
in a more intermediate age.

00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:45.650
What does that
appear to be due to?

00:49:45.650 --> 00:49:47.730
Differing estrogen levels.

00:49:47.730 --> 00:49:50.930
Higher levels of estrogen
at this point in life--

00:49:50.930 --> 00:49:52.290
it's actually not symmetrical.

00:49:52.290 --> 00:49:54.080
It's skewed a little
bit this way--

00:49:54.080 --> 00:49:57.101
and that seems to be
the driving force on it.

00:49:57.101 --> 00:49:57.600
Whoa.

00:49:57.600 --> 00:50:00.110
The age at which
you reach puberty

00:50:00.110 --> 00:50:04.570
has to do with how old the
fetal sack was that you hung out

00:50:04.570 --> 00:50:05.760
for nine months?

00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:07.400
That has an influence?

00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:08.480
Absolutely.

00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:10.690
So prenatal effects.

00:50:10.690 --> 00:50:11.300
More.

00:50:11.300 --> 00:50:12.870
Another version of it.

00:50:12.870 --> 00:50:15.090
Suppose now the
hormone you're getting

00:50:15.090 --> 00:50:16.740
inundated with through
the bloodstream

00:50:16.740 --> 00:50:18.810
is a stress hormone.

00:50:18.810 --> 00:50:21.140
A stress hormone--
glucocorticoids,

00:50:21.140 --> 00:50:23.710
we will learn all about
those down the line--

00:50:23.710 --> 00:50:26.740
a stress hormone,
because mom is stressed.

00:50:26.740 --> 00:50:29.250
What are some of
the consequences?

00:50:29.250 --> 00:50:32.350
For the same prenatal
stress, as an adult,

00:50:32.350 --> 00:50:35.930
you will have a smaller
brain-- if you're a rat.

00:50:35.930 --> 00:50:38.180
You will have a thinner cortex.

00:50:38.180 --> 00:50:40.220
You will have less
learning abilities.

00:50:40.220 --> 00:50:42.470
You will be more
prone towards anxiety.

00:50:42.470 --> 00:50:46.180
You will have fewer of those
benzodiazepine receptors

00:50:46.180 --> 00:50:48.170
that we heard about
the other day.

00:50:48.170 --> 00:50:50.260
You will have more of
a cognitive decline

00:50:50.260 --> 00:50:52.230
when you are a
doddering old rat.

00:50:52.230 --> 00:50:54.840
All sorts of stuff
will go differently

00:50:54.840 --> 00:50:57.060
throughout your entire life.

00:50:57.060 --> 00:50:58.520
But get this.

00:50:58.520 --> 00:51:00.710
OK, look at this mechanism.

00:51:00.710 --> 00:51:02.390
So you are a rat.

00:51:02.390 --> 00:51:04.230
And your mother
was stressed when

00:51:04.230 --> 00:51:05.770
you were a fetus back when.

00:51:05.770 --> 00:51:08.180
And you were marinated
in those glucocorticoids

00:51:08.180 --> 00:51:09.570
when you were a fetus.

00:51:09.570 --> 00:51:12.980
Your brain, overall,
will be smaller.

00:51:12.980 --> 00:51:15.081
There's one particular
brain region,

00:51:15.081 --> 00:51:17.080
which I won't mention
right now because it's not

00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:19.110
really critical,
there's one brain region

00:51:19.110 --> 00:51:21.300
that's particularly hard hit.

00:51:21.300 --> 00:51:23.810
What does that brain region do?

00:51:23.810 --> 00:51:30.730
Among other things, it helps to
turn off the stress response.

00:51:30.730 --> 00:51:34.340
So if that part of
the brain is smaller,

00:51:34.340 --> 00:51:38.850
you're not as good at blocking
glucocorticoid secretion

00:51:38.850 --> 00:51:40.890
at the end of stress.

00:51:40.890 --> 00:51:43.980
And somebody with a normal-sized
whatever, something stressful

00:51:43.980 --> 00:51:45.550
occurs, and they recover.

00:51:45.550 --> 00:51:49.240
And you do this instead.

00:51:49.240 --> 00:51:52.610
Because this mysterious part
of the brain is smaller,

00:51:52.610 --> 00:51:56.200
is not giving as much of a
negative feedback signal.

00:51:56.200 --> 00:51:58.430
And for people new to
endocrinology, that's something

00:51:58.430 --> 00:52:00.010
you'll be getting
in a couple weeks.

00:52:00.010 --> 00:52:03.630
The net result is, if this
part of the brain is smaller,

00:52:03.630 --> 00:52:09.410
you will have more lifetime
exposure to glucocorticoids.

00:52:09.410 --> 00:52:11.340
So what happens next?

00:52:11.340 --> 00:52:14.970
What happens next, in
addition, baseline is also

00:52:14.970 --> 00:52:17.050
elevated in these individuals.

00:52:17.050 --> 00:52:21.510
So the net result is a lot
more cumulative exposure.

00:52:21.510 --> 00:52:23.630
So you are a female rat.

00:52:23.630 --> 00:52:27.160
And you were in a mother
who was stressed prenatally

00:52:27.160 --> 00:52:28.160
when you were a fetus.

00:52:28.160 --> 00:52:31.220
And as a result, in addition
to all the other problems

00:52:31.220 --> 00:52:34.210
that you've got lifelong,
you secrete higher

00:52:34.210 --> 00:52:36.600
than expected
glucocorticoid levels.

00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:39.350
And eventually,
you get pregnant.

00:52:39.350 --> 00:52:42.300
And thus, your fetus
is going to be exposed

00:52:42.300 --> 00:52:44.320
to elevated
glucocorticoid levels

00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:48.330
and will be born with a
somewhat smaller brain, thinner

00:52:48.330 --> 00:52:50.250
cortex, et cetera, et cetera.

00:52:50.250 --> 00:52:52.150
What have we just shown?

00:52:52.150 --> 00:52:55.890
An environmental manipulation
on a pregnant female

00:52:55.890 --> 00:52:59.190
manifesting itself
two generations later

00:52:59.190 --> 00:53:00.760
in the grandchildren.

00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:03.200
And when this was first
described in the early '60s,

00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:05.590
this was called the
grandmother effect.

00:53:05.590 --> 00:53:08.180
And eventually, it
was shown to go out

00:53:08.180 --> 00:53:09.870
about four or five generations.

00:53:09.870 --> 00:53:12.310
The magnitude the
effect would get smaller

00:53:12.310 --> 00:53:14.520
with each generation,
before it disappeared.

00:53:14.520 --> 00:53:16.580
But look at what this is about.

00:53:16.580 --> 00:53:20.500
This is inheriting a
trait that is not genetic.

00:53:20.500 --> 00:53:23.590
And this wound up being the
first example of what is now

00:53:23.590 --> 00:53:27.020
called, non-Mendelian
inheritance

00:53:27.020 --> 00:53:31.270
of traits, non-genetic
inheritance of traits.

00:53:31.270 --> 00:53:35.220
And all you've got going
here is prenatal environment.

00:53:35.220 --> 00:53:38.140
Extremely powerful observation.

00:53:38.140 --> 00:53:41.680
And what you also then have
is, your some researcher,

00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:44.320
and again, you come
along one second

00:53:44.320 --> 00:53:47.360
after the animal is born.

00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:49.700
And you wind up studying,
saying oh, look at this.

00:53:49.700 --> 00:53:53.160
This rat tends to have elevated
glucocorticoid levels, just

00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:53.820
like mom.

00:53:53.820 --> 00:53:56.880
And this rat tends to have a
thinner cortex, just like mom.

00:53:56.880 --> 00:53:58.480
And this rat-- and
if you've never

00:53:58.480 --> 00:54:01.060
heard of prenatal
environmental effects, what's

00:54:01.060 --> 00:54:02.990
the only conclusion
you could make?

00:54:02.990 --> 00:54:06.210
There are genetic
influences on these traits.

00:54:06.210 --> 00:54:09.990
So these non-Mendelian,
non-genetic transmission

00:54:09.990 --> 00:54:13.500
of traits are really,
really important.

00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:14.280
Next thing.

00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:16.730
What else is floating around
in mom's bloodstream that

00:54:16.730 --> 00:54:18.540
gets shared, besides hormones?

00:54:18.540 --> 00:54:19.970
Nutrients.

00:54:19.970 --> 00:54:20.770
Nutrients.

00:54:20.770 --> 00:54:23.800
And this winds up producing
something extremely interesting

00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:24.530
as well.

00:54:24.530 --> 00:54:25.990
OK, it's all a blur by now.

00:54:25.990 --> 00:54:28.460
Have we already talked
about Dutch Hunger Winter?

00:54:28.460 --> 00:54:31.060
It was in the video we
watched while you were gone.

00:54:31.060 --> 00:54:33.793
Oh.

00:54:33.793 --> 00:54:35.198
[BLOWS RASPBERRY] OK.

00:54:35.198 --> 00:54:36.870
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:36.870 --> 00:54:40.067
Well, now that you all know
about-- what did I say?

00:54:40.067 --> 00:54:41.650
That was only like
100 people, though.

00:54:41.650 --> 00:54:42.520
OK.

00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:45.770
OK, for those of you who
didn't-- Dutch Hunger Winter,

00:54:45.770 --> 00:54:47.720
here's the deal.

00:54:47.720 --> 00:54:52.660
If you were a fetus in Holland
during the winter of 1944,

00:54:52.660 --> 00:54:54.870
something very interesting
happened with you.

00:54:54.870 --> 00:54:58.130
1944, Holland is still
occupied by the Nazis.

00:54:58.130 --> 00:55:00.420
Nazis are being
pressured on all fronts.

00:55:00.420 --> 00:55:03.360
In the process of losing,
they're falling back.

00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:05.980
They're losing a lot of
the land they've occupied.

00:55:05.980 --> 00:55:08.080
And what they decide
to do that winter

00:55:08.080 --> 00:55:11.070
is, because they need some
food and because they wanted

00:55:11.070 --> 00:55:14.000
to punish the Dutch for
beginning to be more openly

00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:16.290
in the resistance, what
they did was, that winter,

00:55:16.290 --> 00:55:19.990
they diverted all of the
food in Holland to Germany.

00:55:19.990 --> 00:55:23.320
And historically known as
the Dutch Hunger Winter.

00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:27.080
Essentially, people went
from a perfectly fine,

00:55:27.080 --> 00:55:29.940
healthy-- amid the
context of a war--

00:55:29.940 --> 00:55:32.520
Western-European diet,
down to something

00:55:32.520 --> 00:55:34.520
like that from out of nowhere.

00:55:34.520 --> 00:55:38.290
40,000 people starved to death
during the Dutch Hunger Winter.

00:55:38.290 --> 00:55:40.950
Something very
interesting occurred,

00:55:40.950 --> 00:55:45.070
if you were a third-trimester
fetus, during the Dutch Hunger

00:55:45.070 --> 00:55:47.680
Winter, because it only
lasted for the winter.

00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:51.020
The Allies came in,
liberated Holland after that.

00:55:51.020 --> 00:55:53.520
And it went to something
like this, something

00:55:53.520 --> 00:55:56.340
resembling a step
function of starvation

00:55:56.340 --> 00:55:58.440
for about three months.

00:55:58.440 --> 00:56:01.940
If you were third-trimester
fetus during the Dutch Hunger

00:56:01.940 --> 00:56:05.790
Winter, your body learned
something important,

00:56:05.790 --> 00:56:09.380
which is here is not a whole
lot of calories out there.

00:56:09.380 --> 00:56:12.840
During third trimester,
fetuses are in some way--

00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:17.620
and this is metaphorical--
deciding, learning how much,

00:56:17.620 --> 00:56:19.450
in the way of
nutrients out there

00:56:19.450 --> 00:56:22.440
in the world, how readily
do calories come in?

00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:24.220
How is the fetus finding out?

00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:26.350
By way of mom's circulation.

00:56:26.350 --> 00:56:27.720
Mom is starving.

00:56:27.720 --> 00:56:30.850
And thus, much lower levels of
nutrients in the bloodstream.

00:56:30.850 --> 00:56:33.720
And the fetus, at that
point in development,

00:56:33.720 --> 00:56:36.170
is saying, metaphorically,
well, what's

00:56:36.170 --> 00:56:38.220
it like out there in
this place I'm going

00:56:38.220 --> 00:56:39.890
to be heading to rather soon?

00:56:39.890 --> 00:56:42.490
What's the nutritional
profile like?

00:56:42.490 --> 00:56:45.760
There's not much in the
way of food out there.

00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:49.760
And as a result, the fetus
has-- and the term used now

00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:52.110
is "metabolic programming."

00:56:52.110 --> 00:56:56.380
There is metabolic programming,
or metabolic imprinting--

00:56:56.380 --> 00:56:58.110
notice the word
"imprinting" here being

00:56:58.110 --> 00:56:59.960
used in a completely
different sense

00:56:59.960 --> 00:57:03.250
than we've heard about
already-- metabolic programming

00:57:03.250 --> 00:57:07.950
to produce what is called
a thrifty phenotype.

00:57:07.950 --> 00:57:11.030
The fetus, realizing
there is nothing out there

00:57:11.030 --> 00:57:13.440
in the way of plentiful
food, what it does

00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:16.810
is it programs its
pancreas to function in

00:57:16.810 --> 00:57:18.810
a certain way forever after.

00:57:18.810 --> 00:57:20.500
What does the pancreas do?

00:57:20.500 --> 00:57:24.010
The smallest smidgen of
food hits the bloodstream,

00:57:24.010 --> 00:57:26.690
and the pancreas is
pumping out insulin,

00:57:26.690 --> 00:57:29.970
which helps store all that
stuff and quickly scarf up

00:57:29.970 --> 00:57:32.250
every bit of nutrient
in the bloodstream

00:57:32.250 --> 00:57:34.150
and store it away,
because you've got

00:57:34.150 --> 00:57:36.440
to be as efficient as possible.

00:57:36.440 --> 00:57:39.930
And you've metabolically
programmed your kidneys,

00:57:39.930 --> 00:57:42.960
so that your kidneys are
incredibly good at retaining

00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:45.060
salt. Because along
with starvation,

00:57:45.060 --> 00:57:46.710
there's going to
be salt shortages.

00:57:46.710 --> 00:57:49.780
So really hold on to salt.
And you are born with a body

00:57:49.780 --> 00:57:54.770
with a thrifty metabolism,
very good at retaining salt,

00:57:54.770 --> 00:57:58.590
and spectacular at storing
away every bit of nutrients

00:57:58.590 --> 00:58:00.560
that hits the bloodstream.

00:58:00.560 --> 00:58:04.450
So at that point, you go
back to this sort of diet.

00:58:04.450 --> 00:58:06.320
And you have that for
the rest of your life.

00:58:06.320 --> 00:58:09.270
And what has now been shown
with the Dutch Hunger Winter

00:58:09.270 --> 00:58:13.260
individuals, the ones who were
third-trimester fetuses then,

00:58:13.260 --> 00:58:17.850
as adults, they have a
19-fold increased incidence

00:58:17.850 --> 00:58:22.520
of obesity, hypertension,
diabetes, and what's

00:58:22.520 --> 00:58:25.580
called metabolic syndrome.

00:58:25.580 --> 00:58:26.990
What's that about?

00:58:26.990 --> 00:58:30.090
Their body has programmed
to be extremely

00:58:30.090 --> 00:58:31.720
thrifty with metabolism.

00:58:31.720 --> 00:58:34.620
And as such, it is
forever after storing

00:58:34.620 --> 00:58:37.970
away every of the
grotesque Westernized diets

00:58:37.970 --> 00:58:39.610
that we all wallow in.

00:58:39.610 --> 00:58:43.150
And what you've got then
is setting individuals

00:58:43.150 --> 00:58:48.610
up for a much, much higher risk
of these metabolic disorders.

00:58:48.610 --> 00:58:52.150
If you were a newborn at
the time, it didn't happen.

00:58:52.150 --> 00:58:54.180
A newborn during
here, the metabolic

00:58:54.180 --> 00:58:55.850
programming is
already over by then.

00:58:55.850 --> 00:58:59.130
If you were a first-trimester
fetus, didn't happen.

00:58:59.130 --> 00:59:01.500
The metabolic programming
hasn't started yet.

00:59:01.500 --> 00:59:04.960
Second, the later part or
second to third trimester

00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:07.600
is when the programming goes on.

00:59:07.600 --> 00:59:10.430
And this was a
landmark observation.

00:59:10.430 --> 00:59:11.980
This was really important.

00:59:11.980 --> 00:59:13.880
Among other things,
you get the people

00:59:13.880 --> 00:59:16.850
who do not like the notion
of these subtle effects.

00:59:16.850 --> 00:59:18.310
And they're saying, OK, sure.

00:59:18.310 --> 00:59:20.520
This can happen,
but this is subtle.

00:59:20.520 --> 00:59:22.980
19-fold is not subtle.

00:59:22.980 --> 00:59:25.930
And this was the
landmark study that

00:59:25.930 --> 00:59:30.800
ushered in what is now called
a whole field of fetal origins

00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:33.080
of adult disease.

00:59:33.080 --> 00:59:35.200
Fetal origins of
adult disease, which

00:59:35.200 --> 00:59:37.850
a lot of realms
of medicine think

00:59:37.850 --> 00:59:40.820
is outrageous and couldn't
possibly work this way.

00:59:40.820 --> 00:59:44.030
And it is popping up in
more and more domains.

00:59:44.030 --> 00:59:47.360
Elevated levels of stress
hormones during fetal life,

00:59:47.360 --> 00:59:50.040
increased likelihood
of anxiety disorders

00:59:50.040 --> 00:59:53.470
as an adult, independent
of post-natal environment.

00:59:53.470 --> 00:59:58.030
Other examples like that, all of
these being ones of programming

00:59:58.030 --> 00:59:59.780
around that time.

00:59:59.780 --> 01:00:03.990
And the Dutch Hunger Winter
one is the iconic example.

01:00:03.990 --> 01:00:06.790
You know, what we're all
accustomed to is yeah,

01:00:06.790 --> 01:00:09.609
you study something
in, like, a planaria.

01:00:09.609 --> 01:00:10.900
And then you study it in a rat.

01:00:10.900 --> 01:00:12.108
And you study it in a monkey.

01:00:12.108 --> 01:00:14.100
And then you study it
in a college freshman.

01:00:14.100 --> 01:00:17.160
And finally, when it's-- now,
you can conclude something

01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:18.860
maybe, maybe about humans.

01:00:18.860 --> 01:00:22.620
This was first discovered in
this population of humans.

01:00:22.620 --> 01:00:25.400
This was no, is this
relevant to humans.

01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:28.220
Interestingly, there
was another population

01:00:28.220 --> 01:00:30.430
at the time that went
through something or other

01:00:30.430 --> 01:00:34.170
like that, which was people
in the city of Stalingrad

01:00:34.170 --> 01:00:36.260
who were under
siege by the Nazis

01:00:36.260 --> 01:00:40.050
and had essentially years
worth of severe starvation.

01:00:40.050 --> 01:00:43.190
They didn't get a Dutch
Hunger Winter phenomenon,

01:00:43.190 --> 01:00:46.360
because the food
coasted off like this.

01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:48.400
And afterward, it
took years for it

01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:50.720
to reach a
Western-European average.

01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:53.070
You don't get it under
those circumstances.

01:00:53.070 --> 01:00:55.960
It's a step function like this.

01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:56.460
OK.

01:00:56.460 --> 01:00:57.910
So think about this now.

01:00:57.910 --> 01:01:00.520
So you were a Dutch
Hunger Winter fetus.

01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:03.400
And as a result, you have
a very thrifty metabolism.

01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:07.370
And 30 years later,
you've gotten pregnant.

01:01:07.370 --> 01:01:09.780
You're having a
perfectly normal diet,

01:01:09.780 --> 01:01:11.690
normal intake of calories.

01:01:11.690 --> 01:01:14.250
But you've got this
thrifty metabolism.

01:01:14.250 --> 01:01:17.510
And as a result,
your body is really

01:01:17.510 --> 01:01:20.480
good at pulling nutrients
out of the bloodstream,

01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:24.310
because you secrete more
insulin than most people would.

01:01:24.310 --> 01:01:26.940
With your thrifty
metabolism, you

01:01:26.940 --> 01:01:30.600
are pulling a disproportionate
share of the calories out

01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:31.590
of the bloodstream.

01:01:31.590 --> 01:01:36.230
And thus, your fetus is getting
a disproportionately smaller

01:01:36.230 --> 01:01:37.800
amount of calories.

01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:41.570
And thus, your fetus is
born with a milder version

01:01:41.570 --> 01:01:44.600
of the Dutch Hunger
Winter phenomenon.

01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:47.510
And this has now been
shown in the grandchildren

01:01:47.510 --> 01:01:49.580
of Dutch Hunger Winter fetuses.

01:01:49.580 --> 01:01:51.920
This is that exact same deal.

01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:55.940
This is non-Mendelian,
non-genetic transmission

01:01:55.940 --> 01:01:58.740
of traits, multigenerationally.

01:01:58.740 --> 01:02:01.510
Absolutely astonishing
that this could work.

01:02:01.510 --> 01:02:04.250
And the biology is
all in place for it.

01:02:04.250 --> 01:02:07.580
What we will see in a little
while is what the mechanism is,

01:02:07.580 --> 01:02:11.170
and it's been identified down
to the molecular level of what

01:02:11.170 --> 01:02:14.700
went on in these Dutch Hunger
Winter-- OK, I'll give it away.

01:02:14.700 --> 01:02:18.110
Remember that epigenetic
business the other day?

01:02:18.110 --> 01:02:22.030
There are epigenetic
changes in the gene's coding

01:02:22.030 --> 01:02:27.370
for things related to insulin in
the Dutch Hunger Winter babies.

01:02:27.370 --> 01:02:29.440
So enormous effect.

01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:32.650
Another example of it,
another dietary one,

01:02:32.650 --> 01:02:35.660
which is, if you are
female-- and female human,

01:02:35.660 --> 01:02:38.540
among other species, this
has been shown in-- there's

01:02:38.540 --> 01:02:42.320
an issue of how much estrogen
does your mother consume

01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:43.950
when you were a fetus.

01:02:43.950 --> 01:02:46.950
Where's estrogen coming
from in the diet?

01:02:46.950 --> 01:02:51.220
From a lot of different types
of plants, phytoestrogens.

01:02:51.220 --> 01:02:54.990
And what the studies show
is that increased exposure

01:02:54.990 --> 01:02:57.580
to estrogen derived
from phytoestrogens

01:02:57.580 --> 01:03:01.230
during fetal life, and there
is a small but consistent

01:03:01.230 --> 01:03:03.650
increased risk of
estrogen-dependent breast

01:03:03.650 --> 01:03:07.910
cancer, 20 years
later, 90 years later.

01:03:07.910 --> 01:03:12.020
Again, very subtle prenatal
environmental effects

01:03:12.020 --> 01:03:17.170
playing out forever, even unto
the generations after you.

01:03:17.170 --> 01:03:20.770
Another realm of prenatal
effects, learning.

01:03:20.770 --> 01:03:23.500
OK, this sounds ludicrous
right off the bat,

01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:26.210
that you can have
learning prenatally.

01:03:26.210 --> 01:03:27.960
You have learning prenatally.

01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:30.790
You can show this first in rats.

01:03:30.790 --> 01:03:32.040
Here's what you do.

01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:36.780
You take a rat fetus, and
you can inject into it

01:03:36.780 --> 01:03:41.260
a particular flavor of
water along with sucrose.

01:03:41.260 --> 01:03:43.220
And the fetus absorbs it.

01:03:43.220 --> 01:03:46.050
The fetus actually drinks
amniotic fluid, which

01:03:46.050 --> 01:03:47.770
I find to be deeply creepy.

01:03:47.770 --> 01:03:50.140
But nonetheless, you
inject this stuff in there.

01:03:50.140 --> 01:03:52.340
And you are doing this a
number of days running.

01:03:52.340 --> 01:03:55.440
And this fetus is now
drinking this flavor that

01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:57.970
has a lot of sucrose in it.

01:03:57.970 --> 01:03:59.450
It tastes good.

01:03:59.450 --> 01:04:00.100
It tastes good?

01:04:00.100 --> 01:04:00.870
You're a fetus.

01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:02.700
What do you mean,
it tastes good?

01:04:02.700 --> 01:04:04.660
The fetus learns about it.

01:04:04.660 --> 01:04:06.960
Because after birth,
given a choice

01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:09.770
between two neutral
flavors, it will

01:04:09.770 --> 01:04:12.740
prefer the flavor it was
exposed to that it was

01:04:12.740 --> 01:04:14.990
drinking when it was a fetus.

01:04:14.990 --> 01:04:17.520
How weird is that?

01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:19.770
More ones-- more ones?

01:04:19.770 --> 01:04:21.030
OK, that was good grammar.

01:04:21.030 --> 01:04:21.720
More ones.

01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:23.130
Here's one from humans.

01:04:23.130 --> 01:04:27.000
And this was a study,
which is as strange

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.090
as you can get,
looking at the fact

01:04:29.090 --> 01:04:32.690
that the diaphragm is
a very good resonating

01:04:32.690 --> 01:04:34.660
membrane, something or other.

01:04:34.660 --> 01:04:39.360
Mother's voices are heard in
the fetal sack quite readily.

01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:42.210
And if I don't know how they
got the fiber-optic camera

01:04:42.210 --> 01:04:44.510
in there, I have no idea
how they got the microphones

01:04:44.510 --> 01:04:45.990
in there for recording that.

01:04:45.990 --> 01:04:49.990
But it is a very resonant
chamber, the diaphragm

01:04:49.990 --> 01:04:51.630
and the amniotic fluid.

01:04:51.630 --> 01:04:55.380
Fetuses hear a lot of
what's going on out there,

01:04:55.380 --> 01:04:57.910
most notably mom's voice.

01:04:57.910 --> 01:05:01.220
So this was a study, a
totally inspired one.

01:05:01.220 --> 01:05:03.990
And what you had
was, in this one,

01:05:03.990 --> 01:05:06.770
pregnant women spent
their last trimester

01:05:06.770 --> 01:05:10.130
loudly reading either
The Cat in the Hat

01:05:10.130 --> 01:05:12.480
over and over, like
four times a day

01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:15.530
or something, until they
went mad, absolutely mad--

01:05:15.530 --> 01:05:17.310
and that's before the
kid was even born--

01:05:17.310 --> 01:05:21.400
or reading some random
collection of sentences that

01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:24.690
controlled for word length,
that controlled for rhythmicity,

01:05:24.690 --> 01:05:26.310
all of that.

01:05:26.310 --> 01:05:29.880
Then, you get the
newborn some time later,

01:05:29.880 --> 01:05:35.530
and you give them a test of
which they prefer to listen to.

01:05:35.530 --> 01:05:37.960
How do you do that
with a newborn?

01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:41.650
Something you can do is,
when newborns like something,

01:05:41.650 --> 01:05:44.860
they make more sucking
motions with their mouth.

01:05:44.860 --> 01:05:49.490
So you've got a sucko-meter
thing in there measuring it.

01:05:49.490 --> 01:05:53.760
And the newborns prefer
hearing The Cat in the Hat.

01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:55.570
They learned it.

01:05:55.570 --> 01:05:57.640
Not a huge effect,
but nonetheless,

01:05:57.640 --> 01:05:59.170
what is up with that?

01:05:59.170 --> 01:06:01.670
Of course, a follow-up question
that maybe half the people

01:06:01.670 --> 01:06:04.430
in here would be wondering is,
well, what about the fathers?

01:06:04.430 --> 01:06:07.580
And they have the study with the
fathers reading Cat In The Hat

01:06:07.580 --> 01:06:11.690
and, you know, like a megaphone
on mom's belly and reading.

01:06:11.690 --> 01:06:13.250
And it doesn't work.

01:06:13.250 --> 01:06:15.340
It doesn't resonate
enough that side.

01:06:15.340 --> 01:06:17.590
Sounds from the mother.

01:06:17.590 --> 01:06:22.060
OK, so what we see here is this
whole world of stuff going on

01:06:22.060 --> 01:06:25.300
before behavior geneticists
show up and say,

01:06:25.300 --> 01:06:26.960
environment is just started.

01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:30.070
All these prenatal
effects of hormones,

01:06:30.070 --> 01:06:34.430
nutrition, sensory stimulation,
amazing, in some cases,

01:06:34.430 --> 01:06:35.510
multigenerational.

01:06:35.510 --> 01:06:36.102
Yeah?

01:06:36.102 --> 01:06:37.935
Did they catch up with
those children later,

01:06:37.935 --> 01:06:39.768
The Cat in the Hat
children, and see if they

01:06:39.768 --> 01:06:41.710
had a tendency to rhyme more?

01:06:41.710 --> 01:06:43.700
[LAUGHTER]

01:06:43.700 --> 01:06:45.310
Where are they now?

01:06:45.310 --> 01:06:49.406
Remarkably, all of them are
heads of states of countries.

01:06:49.406 --> 01:06:50.672
[LAUGHTER]

01:06:50.672 --> 01:06:52.630
People are still trying
to understand that one.

01:06:52.630 --> 01:06:55.310
But very good
follow-ups on that.

01:06:55.310 --> 01:06:58.610
So we've got this punch
line here, over and over,

01:06:58.610 --> 01:07:01.580
showing the power
of prenatal effects.

01:07:01.580 --> 01:07:02.730
One final study.

01:07:02.730 --> 01:07:05.670
And this was one carried out by
a scientist at Berkeley named,

01:07:05.670 --> 01:07:10.110
Darlene Francis, which took
some amazing surgical skills.

01:07:10.110 --> 01:07:13.210
So there are different
strains of rats

01:07:13.210 --> 01:07:17.190
that have been bred for
different levels of anxiety.

01:07:17.190 --> 01:07:20.250
And we've already heard about
one possibility for that.

01:07:20.250 --> 01:07:22.270
It turns out some
genetic differences

01:07:22.270 --> 01:07:25.780
in the promoter to the gene for
the benzodiazepine receptor.

01:07:25.780 --> 01:07:27.160
There's all sorts
of strains that

01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:29.710
have been bred for high,
low levels of anxiety

01:07:29.710 --> 01:07:31.100
that people have studied.

01:07:31.100 --> 01:07:32.610
They've been bred.

01:07:32.610 --> 01:07:34.950
These are transmissible traits.

01:07:34.950 --> 01:07:37.810
These are heritable,
these are genetic traits.

01:07:37.810 --> 01:07:40.870
Here's what Darlene
Francis did, which

01:07:40.870 --> 01:07:42.810
was she did an adoption study.

01:07:42.810 --> 01:07:45.400
What's the adoption paradigm
we've heard already?

01:07:45.400 --> 01:07:48.250
Right after birth, you
cross-foster the rats,

01:07:48.250 --> 01:07:50.040
or the kids get adopted.

01:07:50.040 --> 01:07:52.400
That's not the
adoption study she did.

01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:55.030
She transferred fetuses.

01:07:55.030 --> 01:07:57.480
She figured out how
to do the surgery

01:07:57.480 --> 01:08:00.890
to remove a fetus early on
in development from one rat

01:08:00.890 --> 01:08:04.240
mom to another rat mom where
they developed perfectly

01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:06.390
normally, once she
had this surgery down.

01:08:06.390 --> 01:08:08.850
And you know what turns
out to be the case?

01:08:08.850 --> 01:08:11.120
It's not a genetic trait.

01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:12.670
It was not a genetic trait.

01:08:12.670 --> 01:08:15.620
You grew up with
the anxiety levels

01:08:15.620 --> 01:08:18.120
matching the strain
of your mother,

01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:22.500
even if the strain of the
individual whose body you

01:08:22.500 --> 01:08:26.359
fetally developed in-- you take
a mom from the high anxiety

01:08:26.359 --> 01:08:29.689
strain, and you take a mom
from the low anxiety strain.

01:08:29.689 --> 01:08:32.370
And you take fetuses from
the high anxiety mom,

01:08:32.370 --> 01:08:35.359
and they go through gestation
in the low anxiety mom.

01:08:35.359 --> 01:08:38.200
And as adults, they
are low anxiety.

01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:42.200
It was not a genetic trait,
it was a prenatal one

01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:46.569
having to do with another one
of those multigenerational

01:08:46.569 --> 01:08:50.700
begatting by having early
experience influencing

01:08:50.700 --> 01:08:53.080
the nature of the pregnancy
you would eventually have,

01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:55.189
and thus, influencing
your fetus,

01:08:55.189 --> 01:08:58.100
producing a different pregnancy
for them down the line.

01:08:58.100 --> 01:09:00.819
This demonstration
of cross-fostering,

01:09:00.819 --> 01:09:04.220
of adopting, as early
as you possibly could,

01:09:04.220 --> 01:09:05.930
enormously important study.

01:09:05.930 --> 01:09:08.189
One really difficult one.

01:09:08.189 --> 01:09:11.380
Yet another wave pounding
on this point, environment

01:09:11.380 --> 01:09:13.180
does not begin at birth.

01:09:13.180 --> 01:09:15.300
And some of the most
important environment

01:09:15.300 --> 01:09:18.020
is not occurring
starting at birth.

01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:20.590
And everything about
behavior genetics,

01:09:20.590 --> 01:09:23.840
classically, was
predicated on there's

01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:25.609
no environment before that.

01:09:25.609 --> 01:09:27.430
OK, so what do they
come back with?

01:09:27.430 --> 01:09:28.620
What's the response?

01:09:28.620 --> 01:09:30.399
We've already seen
a possible way

01:09:30.399 --> 01:09:35.260
of controlling for that, which
is, if you see traits shared

01:09:35.260 --> 01:09:38.590
in common with the
biological father,

01:09:38.590 --> 01:09:40.580
and then you see
more traits shared

01:09:40.580 --> 01:09:43.520
in common with the biological
mother, the increased

01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:48.060
degree of sharedness with the
mom reflects, not the genes,

01:09:48.060 --> 01:09:50.810
because you're getting
the same amount of genes

01:09:50.810 --> 01:09:51.779
from each parent.

01:09:51.779 --> 01:09:54.260
It reflects the
prenatal environment.

01:09:54.260 --> 01:09:57.830
That would be the control that
would be used in these studies.

01:09:57.830 --> 01:09:59.750
The extent to which
a trait is more

01:09:59.750 --> 01:10:03.890
shared with a biological mother
than with a biological father

01:10:03.890 --> 01:10:06.780
is a reflection of
prenatal effects,

01:10:06.780 --> 01:10:10.920
because you get the same amount
of genes from each parent.

01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:15.320
Naturally, this turns out to
be vastly messier than this.

01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:17.080
Because there's a
whole world in which

01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:20.190
you're getting more genetic
influences from your mother

01:10:20.190 --> 01:10:21.910
than from your father.

01:10:21.910 --> 01:10:22.770
OK.

01:10:22.770 --> 01:10:24.926
First one is, once
again, if it turns out

01:10:24.926 --> 01:10:27.300
the person who's claiming to
be the father isn't actually

01:10:27.300 --> 01:10:30.120
the father, that kind of
changes the whole map.

01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:32.120
And once again,
that is a problem

01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:35.300
running through all of human
behavior genetics literature.

01:10:35.300 --> 01:10:38.010
But here, here's the next one.

01:10:38.010 --> 01:10:41.230
Here, we have-- just make sure
we've got our cliche in place

01:10:41.230 --> 01:10:43.330
here-- what is this?

01:10:43.330 --> 01:10:44.547
This is the--

01:10:47.290 --> 01:10:49.990
OK, which is the
what of the cell?

01:10:49.990 --> 01:10:50.720
Powerhouse,

01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:51.540
The powerhouse.

01:10:51.540 --> 01:10:55.010
OK, here we have the powerhouse
of the cell, mitochondria.

01:10:55.010 --> 01:10:58.210
And in this rather odd cell,
there's one mitochondrion,

01:10:58.210 --> 01:11:01.220
but it is standing in for
all of the powerhouses.

01:11:01.220 --> 01:11:03.020
And we've got mitochondria.

01:11:03.020 --> 01:11:05.420
Something that, when you
first learn about this,

01:11:05.420 --> 01:11:08.380
is just flabbergasting,
which is, here

01:11:08.380 --> 01:11:11.650
you've got a cell with
its DNA, and its nucleus,

01:11:11.650 --> 01:11:14.300
and its double helix
thingy happening there.

01:11:14.300 --> 01:11:16.530
And it turns out
that mitochondria

01:11:16.530 --> 01:11:19.440
have their own DNA.

01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:21.660
And this is part
of explaining one

01:11:21.660 --> 01:11:26.930
of the, like, truly amazing,
adventurous, nutty ideas

01:11:26.930 --> 01:11:28.470
that have turned out to be true.

01:11:28.470 --> 01:11:31.790
Scientist, named Lynn Margulis,
University of Massachusetts,

01:11:31.790 --> 01:11:36.090
30 years ago or so, she
noted that this business

01:11:36.090 --> 01:11:38.850
of mitochondria
having their own DNA,

01:11:38.850 --> 01:11:42.240
and came up with this hypothesis
that mitochondria used

01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:44.410
to be independent organisms.

01:11:44.410 --> 01:11:47.480
That in some symbiotic
whatever, billions of years

01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:51.870
ago, got into cells that had
no mitochrondia at the time,

01:11:51.870 --> 01:11:54.900
and that there's been
a symbiosis ever since.

01:11:54.900 --> 01:11:57.590
Mitochondria have
DNA, which are related

01:11:57.590 --> 01:12:00.010
to mitochondrial function.

01:12:00.010 --> 01:12:02.920
Not a ton of the
stuff, nonetheless, you

01:12:02.920 --> 01:12:06.307
have every gene that is critical
for mitochondrial function.

01:12:06.307 --> 01:12:07.140
No, that's not true.

01:12:07.140 --> 01:12:08.910
A few of them have
wound up in here.

01:12:08.910 --> 01:12:11.060
But all of the genes
in here are pretty

01:12:11.060 --> 01:12:13.610
important for
mitochondrial powerhousing,

01:12:13.610 --> 01:12:14.890
all that sort of thing.

01:12:14.890 --> 01:12:19.950
And these are derived from
a completely different world

01:12:19.950 --> 01:12:22.590
of DNA than these.

01:12:22.590 --> 01:12:24.570
So now consider this.

01:12:24.570 --> 01:12:27.580
This cell is an egg.

01:12:27.580 --> 01:12:30.600
This cell is not an egg.

01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:36.990
This cell is just merely
carrying genetic information

01:12:36.990 --> 01:12:38.430
that looks like that.

01:12:38.430 --> 01:12:42.140
What you've got is sperm,
all they are carrying

01:12:42.140 --> 01:12:46.430
are the DNAs, the
genes, the DNA.

01:12:46.430 --> 01:12:50.560
And they don't have cytoplasm,
the fluid-y environment

01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:51.430
in a cell.

01:12:51.430 --> 01:12:54.240
This is one major
dense packing job.

01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:56.800
Here's the critical implication.

01:12:56.800 --> 01:13:02.520
Eggs have mitochondria,
sperm don't.

01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:05.420
So right at the point
of fertilization,

01:13:05.420 --> 01:13:10.710
you have gotten all of your
mitochondria from your mother.

01:13:10.710 --> 01:13:13.430
And thus, all of
the genes related

01:13:13.430 --> 01:13:15.360
to mitochondrial
function that are

01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:19.160
contained in the mitochondria
you don't get from fathers.

01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:22.220
It is exclusively
inherited from mothers.

01:13:22.220 --> 01:13:26.690
Mitochondrial DNA solely
comes from the mother.

01:13:26.690 --> 01:13:28.730
So what we've just
seen as a first pass

01:13:28.730 --> 01:13:31.650
is it's not an even 50/50 split.

01:13:31.650 --> 01:13:34.380
You get a disproportionate
share of your DNA

01:13:34.380 --> 01:13:36.180
coming from the mother.

01:13:36.180 --> 01:13:37.500
Really important.

01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:39.320
And one that's been
used by all sorts

01:13:39.320 --> 01:13:42.990
of evolutionary geneticists
to trace legacies.

01:13:42.990 --> 01:13:48.410
If these mitochondrial DNA is
only passed along female lines,

01:13:48.410 --> 01:13:51.210
that allows you to figure
out all sorts of stuff

01:13:51.210 --> 01:13:52.420
about evolution.

01:13:52.420 --> 01:13:56.430
It has given rise to the Eve
hypothesis, that somewhere back

01:13:56.430 --> 01:14:00.700
then was a woman, probably
some sort of early hominid,

01:14:00.700 --> 01:14:05.380
who is ultimately the ancestor,
the great, great, great, great,

01:14:05.380 --> 01:14:08.330
great, grandmother of every
single human on Earth.

01:14:08.330 --> 01:14:12.160
And it can be traced through
the mitochondrial DNA.

01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:14.030
So that's an asymmetry.

01:14:14.030 --> 01:14:15.020
Next one.

01:14:15.020 --> 01:14:18.320
Next source of asymmetry
is back to that business

01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:20.290
about imprinted genes.

01:14:20.290 --> 01:14:22.270
From a couple of weeks
ago, you remember

01:14:22.270 --> 01:14:25.140
that one, genes that
are working differently,

01:14:25.140 --> 01:14:28.210
depending on which parent
you are getting them from.

01:14:28.210 --> 01:14:30.970
So that one's a violation
as well of this rule

01:14:30.970 --> 01:14:35.230
that you get all of your DNA in
equal amounts from each parent.

01:14:35.230 --> 01:14:39.050
This is another thing that
possibly skews the ratio.

01:14:39.050 --> 01:14:42.090
Now, here's another
very interesting thing.

01:14:42.090 --> 01:14:44.170
So you've got the egg here.

01:14:44.170 --> 01:14:47.690
And not only does it have this
cytoplasm with mitochondria

01:14:47.690 --> 01:14:51.110
floating around,
but in addition,

01:14:51.110 --> 01:14:53.130
there's other stuff
floating around in there,

01:14:53.130 --> 01:14:56.290
like transcription factors.

01:14:56.290 --> 01:14:59.190
Sperm don't have
transcription factors.

01:14:59.190 --> 01:15:02.480
Sperm, all they're doing is on
this, like, suicide swimming

01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:03.350
mission there.

01:15:03.350 --> 01:15:05.000
And they're not
making any new genes.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.700
All they're doing is
this one, long spurt

01:15:07.700 --> 01:15:09.700
of racing for the end.

01:15:09.700 --> 01:15:12.160
And in the case of
the eggs, though, you

01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:14.000
have transcription factors.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:17.430
You have all sorts of
proteins in the cytoplasm.

01:15:17.430 --> 01:15:20.750
You've got a fully functioning
cell, instead of this, sort of,

01:15:20.750 --> 01:15:23.520
much more streamlined version.

01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:28.430
All the transcription factors
that come in a fertilized egg

01:15:28.430 --> 01:15:31.130
are coming from the mother.

01:15:31.130 --> 01:15:33.542
So what does that
wind up meaning?

01:15:33.542 --> 01:15:36.120
Transcription factors,
those are proteins.

01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:37.580
We're not talking
about genes here.

01:15:37.580 --> 01:15:39.560
We just saw how
you get more genes

01:15:39.560 --> 01:15:41.140
from your mother
than your father,

01:15:41.140 --> 01:15:42.940
these mitochondrial genes.

01:15:42.940 --> 01:15:45.590
OK, but transcription
factors, the father

01:15:45.590 --> 01:15:47.310
has genes for
transcription factors.

01:15:47.310 --> 01:15:49.520
The mother has genes for
transcription factors.

01:15:49.520 --> 01:15:52.840
What's the significance of
getting your transcription

01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:56.850
factors from your mother
in the fertilized egg?

01:15:56.850 --> 01:15:57.630
OK.

01:15:57.630 --> 01:16:01.200
Consider here two genes.

01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:05.950
The first one codes for
transcription factor A.

01:16:05.950 --> 01:16:06.930
We know that already.

01:16:06.930 --> 01:16:08.940
Transcription factors
are typically proteins,

01:16:08.940 --> 01:16:11.070
so they have their own
genes all the way down.

01:16:11.070 --> 01:16:16.600
And this codes for gene
X, whatever that is.

01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:19.120
So here's what you've got.

01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:25.760
There are promoters responsive
to transcription factor A.

01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:29.950
Transcription factor A turns
on the synthesis of the protein

01:16:29.950 --> 01:16:32.550
coded for by gene
X. And in addition,

01:16:32.550 --> 01:16:37.060
transcription factor A turns
on transcription factor A gene.

01:16:37.060 --> 01:16:39.130
It's a positive feedback
loop where it makes

01:16:39.130 --> 01:16:40.720
more and more of the stuff.

01:16:40.720 --> 01:16:43.950
That's the way this particular
transcription factor works.

01:16:43.950 --> 01:16:46.870
So suppose this is
the only thing that

01:16:46.870 --> 01:16:51.570
can activate transcription
of gene X. So

01:16:51.570 --> 01:16:55.210
suppose you've got some
environmental event which,

01:16:55.210 --> 01:16:59.540
as a result of it, knocks out
the activity of transcription

01:16:59.540 --> 01:17:04.220
factor X in an egg.

01:17:04.220 --> 01:17:05.560
The egg is fertilized.

01:17:05.560 --> 01:17:12.540
And as a result of transcription
factor A not being expressed,

01:17:12.540 --> 01:17:13.740
it doesn't express more.

01:17:13.740 --> 01:17:16.090
This is the only thing that
drives more expression.

01:17:16.090 --> 01:17:19.490
And you never make gene X.

01:17:19.490 --> 01:17:22.640
Now, somewhere along
the line in your body,

01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:26.650
you are soon making eggs
which contain these genes,

01:17:26.650 --> 01:17:29.270
of course, but
where you have never

01:17:29.270 --> 01:17:33.620
expressed transcription factor
A, because this was knocked out

01:17:33.620 --> 01:17:34.440
in the egg.

01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:38.540
So because of that, you
never express gene X.

01:17:38.540 --> 01:17:40.230
And that egg gets fertilized.

01:17:40.230 --> 01:17:43.660
And you pass on that
trait to your offspring.

01:17:43.660 --> 01:17:48.880
You pass that on, this
acquired trait of transcription

01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:50.380
factor A not working.

01:17:50.380 --> 01:17:52.890
If this is the
circuitry that you have,

01:17:52.890 --> 01:17:56.520
it doesn't matter which
version of gene X you get,

01:17:56.520 --> 01:17:59.720
you are never going to express
that gene for generations

01:17:59.720 --> 01:18:03.010
and generations, forever,
if this is the loop.

01:18:03.010 --> 01:18:06.830
What's going on here, what a
lot of people think is relevant,

01:18:06.830 --> 01:18:09.710
are some environmental
toxins that

01:18:09.710 --> 01:18:11.920
are known to
disrupt the activity

01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:13.970
of certain
transcription factors.

01:18:13.970 --> 01:18:17.740
And what that does is
induce heritability

01:18:17.740 --> 01:18:21.180
in a non-genetic way of
non-expressing of a gene.

01:18:21.180 --> 01:18:24.020
The gene's being inherited,
but it will never ever

01:18:24.020 --> 01:18:25.000
be expressed.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
What have you just acquired?

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.390
A Lamarckian trait.

01:18:29.390 --> 01:18:30.650
You remember Lamarck.

01:18:30.650 --> 01:18:33.880
Everybody learns about Lamarck,
in order to mock him viciously.

01:18:33.880 --> 01:18:37.430
And Lamarck had the notion that
the way evolutionary change

01:18:37.430 --> 01:18:39.220
works, the way
inheritance works,

01:18:39.220 --> 01:18:41.660
is you experience
something, and it

01:18:41.660 --> 01:18:43.490
causes a change in your body.

01:18:43.490 --> 01:18:46.800
And as a result, you pass
on that acquired trait

01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:48.280
to your offspring.

01:18:48.280 --> 01:18:49.020
Ludicrous.

01:18:49.020 --> 01:18:52.580
Lamarckians have been mocked
and pilloried for centuries,

01:18:52.580 --> 01:18:56.300
except in the Soviet Union in
the 1930s, where it gave rise

01:18:56.300 --> 01:19:00.580
to Lysenkoism, a very horrific
piece of genetic history.

01:19:00.580 --> 01:19:03.120
But what you've got is
this complete trashing

01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:05.810
of the notion of you
acquire some trait

01:19:05.810 --> 01:19:09.620
from the environment, and you
pass it on to your offspring.

01:19:09.620 --> 01:19:12.400
This is Lamarckian inheritance.

01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:15.650
This is an environmental factor
that knocks this transcription

01:19:15.650 --> 01:19:17.210
factor out of action.

01:19:17.210 --> 01:19:20.020
And if this is the
wiring that you've got,

01:19:20.020 --> 01:19:22.360
this gene will
never be expressed.

01:19:22.360 --> 01:19:25.350
And as a result, it will never
be expressed in your offspring,

01:19:25.350 --> 01:19:27.830
in your grandkids, et
cetera, all the way down.

01:19:27.830 --> 01:19:30.670
This is Lamarckian
inheritance of a trait.

01:19:30.670 --> 01:19:33.770
And again, where the best
evidence for this has been

01:19:33.770 --> 01:19:37.040
is with environmental
toxins that knock out,

01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:40.750
that have some of these
mutating effects in eggs.

01:19:40.750 --> 01:19:44.200
They are not mutations
in a classical DNA sense.

01:19:44.200 --> 01:19:46.660
But nonetheless, they
are now heritable.

01:19:46.660 --> 01:19:48.830
So that pops up also.

01:19:48.830 --> 01:19:50.160
So have we got here?

01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:52.370
We have the simple
assumption that,

01:19:52.370 --> 01:19:56.150
if you see more sharing
of a trait with the mother

01:19:56.150 --> 01:19:57.920
than with the father,
that's reflecting

01:19:57.920 --> 01:19:59.420
prenatal environment.

01:19:59.420 --> 01:20:01.250
And what we've seen
here is totally

01:20:01.250 --> 01:20:04.110
messing this up is the
fact that you do not

01:20:04.110 --> 01:20:07.280
get equal genetic
influences from each parent.

01:20:07.280 --> 01:20:09.420
You are getting more
genetic material,

01:20:09.420 --> 01:20:11.660
you are getting more
genes from your mother,

01:20:11.660 --> 01:20:15.090
because the mitochondrial DNA.

01:20:15.090 --> 01:20:17.700
Even if you are getting
equal amounts of DNA,

01:20:17.700 --> 01:20:20.210
expression of them will
have different consequences

01:20:20.210 --> 01:20:23.160
because of imprinted genes.

01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:25.430
Finally, in this
world, having nothing

01:20:25.430 --> 01:20:29.710
to do with the amount of
genes or the actual DNA,

01:20:29.710 --> 01:20:32.160
you can have this
Lamarckian inheritance

01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:35.220
of traits due to
environmental perturbations.

01:20:35.220 --> 01:20:37.220
What we see here
are ways ranging

01:20:37.220 --> 01:20:41.320
from extremely subtle and rare
to some rather substantial ones

01:20:41.320 --> 01:20:44.710
with the mitochondria where
you are not getting equivalent

01:20:44.710 --> 01:20:46.660
inheritance from both parents.

01:20:46.660 --> 01:20:49.300
So that confuses things a lot.

01:20:49.300 --> 01:20:50.210
OK.

01:20:50.210 --> 01:20:53.640
So after all of that,
you do, nonetheless,

01:20:53.640 --> 01:20:57.610
get circumstances where
behavior is influenced by genes.

01:20:57.610 --> 01:21:00.270
And by every rule,
it could be shown.

01:21:00.270 --> 01:21:02.580
And by the most
contemporary of techniques

01:21:02.580 --> 01:21:05.510
where people find
the gene and the DNA,

01:21:05.510 --> 01:21:08.370
and they've traced out the steps
in showing that there really

01:21:08.370 --> 01:21:11.050
are genetic influences
on behavior,

01:21:11.050 --> 01:21:15.170
and ones that withstand every
single one of these criticisms.

01:21:15.170 --> 01:21:15.770
OK.

01:21:15.770 --> 01:21:18.400
So sometimes, you've
got genes regulating

01:21:18.400 --> 01:21:20.750
or genes influencing behavior.

01:21:20.750 --> 01:21:23.670
But now we bring in a
whole other possibility.

01:21:23.670 --> 01:21:25.410
And this is something
that was emphasized

01:21:25.410 --> 01:21:29.390
by a psychologist named, Judith
Rich Harris, a number of years

01:21:29.390 --> 01:21:33.000
ago, in a very important book
of hers, called The Nurture

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:36.420
Assumption, which has a
lot to do with arguing

01:21:36.420 --> 01:21:38.320
the relative importance
of influences

01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:40.000
of peer versus parents.

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:41.930
Nonetheless, she
focused in one section

01:21:41.930 --> 01:21:44.750
of the book on the
genetics of behavior

01:21:44.750 --> 01:21:49.580
and focused on what she calls
indirect genetic effects.

01:21:49.580 --> 01:21:52.560
What would indirect
genetic effects be?

01:21:52.560 --> 01:21:53.450
OK.

01:21:53.450 --> 01:21:55.270
You've got that
trait that I referred

01:21:55.270 --> 01:21:57.560
to before, one of
the most reliable

01:21:57.560 --> 01:22:00.070
of traits in the
identical twins separated

01:22:00.070 --> 01:22:03.590
at birth business, 50%
heritability of where

01:22:03.590 --> 01:22:09.410
you are on the introversion,
extroversion continuum.

01:22:09.410 --> 01:22:10.430
OK.

01:22:10.430 --> 01:22:12.650
So that one has
held up pretty well.

01:22:12.650 --> 01:22:16.450
Amid all the possible complaints
about these various approaches,

01:22:16.450 --> 01:22:18.440
that one appears
to be quite solid.

01:22:18.440 --> 01:22:20.780
And you're immediately
off and running

01:22:20.780 --> 01:22:26.270
with, OK, genes for
extroversion, for sociality,

01:22:26.270 --> 01:22:27.330
for all of that.

01:22:27.330 --> 01:22:31.010
What she shows instead is
something else is happening.

01:22:31.010 --> 01:22:37.180
There's a very, very heritable
trait from parent to offspring,

01:22:37.180 --> 01:22:40.030
one of the most heritable
physical traits out there,

01:22:40.030 --> 01:22:45.440
which is your height and
your appearance in general,

01:22:45.440 --> 01:22:48.300
that those are highly
heritable traits.

01:22:48.300 --> 01:22:51.900
And suddenly, you
have a phenomenon that

01:22:51.900 --> 01:22:54.910
is well-documented,
which is people

01:22:54.910 --> 01:22:58.360
who are taller are treated
better and considered

01:22:58.360 --> 01:23:01.608
more attractive, comma,
he says bitterly.

01:23:01.608 --> 01:23:03.090
[LAUGHTER]

01:23:03.090 --> 01:23:05.940
What you've got is people
are treated differently

01:23:05.940 --> 01:23:07.480
along those lines.

01:23:07.480 --> 01:23:09.980
And what is known
also is, people

01:23:09.980 --> 01:23:13.510
who are treated more
positively during development,

01:23:13.510 --> 01:23:17.170
during childhood,
become more extroverted.

01:23:17.170 --> 01:23:21.330
What we have here is not
heritability of the trait

01:23:21.330 --> 01:23:22.810
where you are in
the introversion,

01:23:22.810 --> 01:23:24.430
extroversion continuum.

01:23:24.430 --> 01:23:28.440
What you have is heritability
of a physical trait, which

01:23:28.440 --> 01:23:30.200
causes you to be
treated differently

01:23:30.200 --> 01:23:34.610
in the world, which then brings
about changes in personality.

01:23:34.610 --> 01:23:37.490
And studies have
since shown that most

01:23:37.490 --> 01:23:40.480
of the heritability of the
introversion, extroversion

01:23:40.480 --> 01:23:44.380
is mediated by physical
traits in between.

01:23:44.380 --> 01:23:47.530
So that's a completely
indirect way in which

01:23:47.530 --> 01:23:49.690
you could have gotten to this.

01:23:49.690 --> 01:23:50.880
More cases.

01:23:50.880 --> 01:23:52.300
More cases of this.

01:23:52.300 --> 01:23:53.720
Let's see.

01:23:53.720 --> 01:24:00.810
OK, you can show, in various
bird, turkey, hen species,

01:24:00.810 --> 01:24:04.390
that there are chicks, that
there is heritability of rank.

01:24:04.390 --> 01:24:06.990
You could be born
to a low-ranking mom

01:24:06.990 --> 01:24:08.890
in the pecking
order, high-ranking,

01:24:08.890 --> 01:24:11.350
all the perfect
studies, and controls,

01:24:11.350 --> 01:24:13.170
and cross-fostering,
all of that,

01:24:13.170 --> 01:24:16.110
and there is
heritability of rank.

01:24:16.110 --> 01:24:18.310
But another indirect
genetic effect

01:24:18.310 --> 01:24:20.950
that was subsequently
demonstrated, which is it's

01:24:20.950 --> 01:24:23.160
not the rank that's
being inherited,

01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:25.160
it's a particular
version of genes

01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:29.560
related to melanism of
your feathers, the color

01:24:29.560 --> 01:24:31.640
and iridescence
of your feathers.

01:24:31.640 --> 01:24:34.930
And it turns out, if you have
a certain color pattern, all

01:24:34.930 --> 01:24:37.160
the other like
roosters, and chicks,

01:24:37.160 --> 01:24:40.690
and hens, and poultry,
peck at you more often.

01:24:40.690 --> 01:24:43.290
And you're reduced
to subordination.

01:24:43.290 --> 01:24:47.100
This is not inheritance
of a social dominant trait

01:24:47.100 --> 01:24:49.080
or a social subordination trait.

01:24:49.080 --> 01:24:50.930
This is inheritance
of a gene having

01:24:50.930 --> 01:24:54.420
to do with the color and
iridescence of your feathers,

01:24:54.420 --> 01:24:57.990
which wind up producing
your social rank.

01:24:57.990 --> 01:24:59.510
Another example.

01:24:59.510 --> 01:25:00.670
Here's another one.

01:25:00.670 --> 01:25:03.660
OK, back to chicks
again, which is chicks

01:25:03.660 --> 01:25:08.220
appear to be intuitively
able to peck at grubs shortly

01:25:08.220 --> 01:25:09.470
after birth.

01:25:09.470 --> 01:25:11.790
That they're able to
peck down and get grubs.

01:25:11.790 --> 01:25:14.240
And by all the rules
of behavior genetics,

01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:16.940
with all the constraints
and criticisms answered,

01:25:16.940 --> 01:25:19.710
this appears to be
a heritable trait.

01:25:19.710 --> 01:25:22.750
But it turns out that this
is not what is heritable.

01:25:22.750 --> 01:25:27.470
What is heritable, bizarrely, is
the tendency of newborn chicks

01:25:27.470 --> 01:25:30.280
to find their toes to
be very interesting

01:25:30.280 --> 01:25:32.170
and to peck at their toes.

01:25:32.170 --> 01:25:35.260
And they quickly learn that this
doesn't feel all that great.

01:25:35.260 --> 01:25:37.744
But if you do it in somewhat
more sloppy of a way,

01:25:37.744 --> 01:25:39.160
you get one of
these things that's

01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:41.300
squirmy that tastes good.

01:25:41.300 --> 01:25:44.190
They start off, what is
genetic is the tendency

01:25:44.190 --> 01:25:47.160
to peck at your feet.

01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:48.050
God knows why.

01:25:48.050 --> 01:25:50.220
If you are a newborn
chick, because

01:25:50.220 --> 01:25:53.360
of extremely elegant
high technology

01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:56.210
studies in which newborn
chicks are put in galoshes

01:25:56.210 --> 01:25:57.850
or something and
they don't pack,

01:25:57.850 --> 01:26:01.490
and they don't show the
seemingly innate ability to

01:26:01.490 --> 01:26:03.020
peck for grubs.

01:26:03.020 --> 01:26:05.100
So here, we have
a behavioral trait

01:26:05.100 --> 01:26:09.820
which, in fact, is indirectly
mediated by something else.

01:26:09.820 --> 01:26:11.210
More examples.

01:26:11.210 --> 01:26:16.250
There is, by now, a literature
showing approximately 70%

01:26:16.250 --> 01:26:19.680
heritability-- and I
keep using this word.

01:26:19.680 --> 01:26:23.070
We are going to dissect the
word, "heritability" big time

01:26:23.070 --> 01:26:25.830
in a short while--
There's about 70%

01:26:25.830 --> 01:26:31.440
heritability of political party
affiliation in this country.

01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:35.590
Sharing that behavioral
trait with your parents.

01:26:35.590 --> 01:26:36.660
Whoa.

01:26:36.660 --> 01:26:38.200
What is that about?

01:26:38.200 --> 01:26:40.190
That's sure disturbing.

01:26:40.190 --> 01:26:42.780
And that sure makes
you want to procreate

01:26:42.780 --> 01:26:45.890
in the name of your political
stances, or whatever.

01:26:45.890 --> 01:26:48.350
And this appears to
hold up pretty well

01:26:48.350 --> 01:26:51.310
to some of the standard
criticisms in the literature.

01:26:51.310 --> 01:26:53.340
And it's got nothing
to do with this.

01:26:53.340 --> 01:26:55.460
What's the mediating variable?

01:26:55.460 --> 01:26:58.030
A large really
interesting literature

01:26:58.030 --> 01:27:01.460
showing, when you compare
political or social

01:27:01.460 --> 01:27:05.610
progressives with political
or social conservatives, one

01:27:05.610 --> 01:27:08.280
of the most reliable
personality differences

01:27:08.280 --> 01:27:12.000
is how they feel
about ambiguity.

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:16.220
Conservatives, on the average
do not like ambiguity.

01:27:16.220 --> 01:27:18.580
They are much more
ambiguity-averse.

01:27:18.580 --> 01:27:20.460
And you can start
it with showing

01:27:20.460 --> 01:27:23.470
ambiguous sensory
stimuli in kids

01:27:23.470 --> 01:27:26.170
and looking at heart
rate responses to it.

01:27:26.170 --> 01:27:29.470
And that tends to be a
stable personality difference

01:27:29.470 --> 01:27:31.460
at political extremes.

01:27:31.460 --> 01:27:33.940
You will see, some
time later on,

01:27:33.940 --> 01:27:37.060
that there's a whole world
of moral development in kids

01:27:37.060 --> 01:27:39.900
where there's various
scales measuring.

01:27:39.900 --> 01:27:42.910
One's Kohlberg's Stage
of Moral Development.

01:27:42.910 --> 01:27:44.760
There was an old
literature suggesting

01:27:44.760 --> 01:27:48.370
political differences as to
how fancy of a Kohlberg stage

01:27:48.370 --> 01:27:48.990
you got to.

01:27:48.990 --> 01:27:51.220
We will see that,
despite what struck me

01:27:51.220 --> 01:27:54.210
as the intuitive sort of
logic of what was found.

01:27:54.210 --> 01:27:55.440
That one hasn't held up.

01:27:55.440 --> 01:27:58.050
But one that does
hold up is difference

01:27:58.050 --> 01:28:00.210
in ambiguity tolerance.

01:28:00.210 --> 01:28:03.250
And that's probably
the mediating trait.

01:28:03.250 --> 01:28:07.340
It is not inheriting a tendency
to like elephants, or donkeys,

01:28:07.340 --> 01:28:08.140
or whatever.

01:28:08.140 --> 01:28:10.780
It is instead having
this intermediate trait.

01:28:10.780 --> 01:28:13.790
Final example of what would
be an intermediate trait.

01:28:13.790 --> 01:28:16.240
There's a whole bunch
of rat and mouse strains

01:28:16.240 --> 01:28:17.900
that have been
developed that have

01:28:17.900 --> 01:28:21.850
differing levels of aggression,
high aggression strains.

01:28:21.850 --> 01:28:23.810
And you do all the
proper controls,

01:28:23.810 --> 01:28:26.010
and you can show that
this is a genetic trait.

01:28:26.010 --> 01:28:28.630
Whoa, heritability
of aggression.

01:28:28.630 --> 01:28:32.600
We're suddenly back to twin
adoption studies and Kety

01:28:32.600 --> 01:28:35.360
with heritability of
criminality, all of that,

01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:38.720
heritability of aggression,
what's actually going on

01:28:38.720 --> 01:28:43.050
in all of the strains identified
to date by spontaneous traits

01:28:43.050 --> 01:28:44.800
coming up and then
breeding for it.

01:28:44.800 --> 01:28:47.040
What you see instead
is the strain

01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:51.330
that is so aggressive, and
so pissy, and so impossible,

01:28:51.330 --> 01:28:55.210
and so constrained by the law
and order of rodent society,

01:28:55.210 --> 01:28:56.070
and all of that.

01:28:56.070 --> 01:28:59.640
They've got a lower threshold
for pain sensitivity.

01:28:59.640 --> 01:29:01.860
Things hurt them more readily.

01:29:01.860 --> 01:29:04.080
And they're more likely
to become aggressive

01:29:04.080 --> 01:29:05.010
at that point.

01:29:05.010 --> 01:29:08.850
It turns out it's genetic
differences in the neurobiology

01:29:08.850 --> 01:29:10.530
of pain sensitivity.

01:29:10.530 --> 01:29:13.030
So what we're seeing
here, over and over is,

01:29:13.030 --> 01:29:16.410
amid the gazillion
of criticisms we've

01:29:16.410 --> 01:29:19.400
had about when does
environment actually start,

01:29:19.400 --> 01:29:21.200
and when do
environmental assumptions

01:29:21.200 --> 01:29:22.950
and being treated
the same go down

01:29:22.950 --> 01:29:25.630
the tubes, and differential
inheritance of genes,

01:29:25.630 --> 01:29:28.310
yeah some traits do appear
to have some fairly strong

01:29:28.310 --> 01:29:29.550
genetic components.

01:29:29.550 --> 01:29:32.940
But even once you get
that far, they very often

01:29:32.940 --> 01:29:36.230
are through some
very indirect routes.

01:29:36.230 --> 01:29:39.320
OK more things here.

01:29:39.320 --> 01:29:39.920
More things?

01:29:39.920 --> 01:29:41.100
We just covered that.

01:29:41.100 --> 01:29:43.430
OK, a little bit
more on epigenetics,

01:29:43.430 --> 01:29:44.830
which is that
whole business, you

01:29:44.830 --> 01:29:46.960
remember, from the
other day, which

01:29:46.960 --> 01:29:50.640
is after you've got
the DNA, and then you

01:29:50.640 --> 01:29:54.460
have that whole world of
protein coatings, which

01:29:54.460 --> 01:29:57.020
I've been very careful not
to give the jargony name for,

01:29:57.020 --> 01:29:58.326
because it's not important.

01:29:58.326 --> 01:29:59.950
But what you've got
is this whole world

01:29:59.950 --> 01:30:04.370
where regulation is not so
much at the level of genes--

01:30:04.370 --> 01:30:07.670
and in 95% of the DNA,
that's the on/off switches--

01:30:07.670 --> 01:30:11.210
but whether the transcription
factors can even get in there,

01:30:11.210 --> 01:30:14.160
and this world of
epigenetic changes

01:30:14.160 --> 01:30:17.030
that will cause lifelong
differences in how

01:30:17.030 --> 01:30:20.380
readily transcription factors
get to something or other.

01:30:20.380 --> 01:30:22.320
What have you got at that point?

01:30:22.320 --> 01:30:26.440
The exact same possibilities
as this one here.

01:30:26.440 --> 01:30:29.370
If instead of, due to
some environmental toxin,

01:30:29.370 --> 01:30:33.390
you knock a transcription factor
out of business in a fertilized

01:30:33.390 --> 01:30:36.830
egg where there's the set up
of genes, if for some reason,

01:30:36.830 --> 01:30:39.340
whatever, you do not
have access to it because

01:30:39.340 --> 01:30:41.140
of an epigenetic
change, it's going

01:30:41.140 --> 01:30:43.410
to be the exact
same consequence,

01:30:43.410 --> 01:30:47.460
multigenerational inheritance
of non-genetic traits

01:30:47.460 --> 01:30:51.240
due to epigenetic, rather
than genetic differences.

01:30:51.240 --> 01:30:54.630
That is turning out to be what
went on in the Dutch Hunger

01:30:54.630 --> 01:30:56.410
Winter people and
the animal models

01:30:56.410 --> 01:31:00.960
of epigenetic differences and
access of transcription factors

01:31:00.960 --> 01:31:03.770
to genes related to
insulin metabolism.

01:31:03.770 --> 01:31:06.120
That turns out to
be a critical one.

01:31:06.120 --> 01:31:09.140
Here is one of the coolest
examples of this to date.

01:31:09.140 --> 01:31:11.900
And this is work done by a guy
at McGill University, named

01:31:11.900 --> 01:31:13.440
Michael Meaney.

01:31:13.440 --> 01:31:17.930
And what he has focused
on is what started off

01:31:17.930 --> 01:31:20.840
as a very artificial
literature, which is,

01:31:20.840 --> 01:31:24.920
take yourself a newborn rat,
and for the first two weeks

01:31:24.920 --> 01:31:26.580
or so of its life,
every day, you

01:31:26.580 --> 01:31:29.730
pick it up for three
minutes and you pet it.

01:31:29.730 --> 01:31:31.210
And now, you put it back.

01:31:31.210 --> 01:31:33.130
And all else being
equal, it will

01:31:33.130 --> 01:31:36.220
have a bigger brain in
adulthood, better learning

01:31:36.220 --> 01:31:38.440
abilities, more resistance
to a whole bunch

01:31:38.440 --> 01:31:42.070
of neurological insults,
lower glucocorticoid levels,

01:31:42.070 --> 01:31:44.010
et cetera, that
whole world of what

01:31:44.010 --> 01:31:47.070
came to be known as
neonatal handling.

01:31:47.070 --> 01:31:49.120
On the other hand,
pick up the rat,

01:31:49.120 --> 01:31:51.720
take it away from mom
for, instead of 3 minutes,

01:31:51.720 --> 01:31:53.140
an hour and a half.

01:31:53.140 --> 01:31:55.190
Then each day, put him back.

01:31:55.190 --> 01:31:57.890
And as an adult, it's going
to have a smaller brain

01:31:57.890 --> 01:31:59.460
and a shorter life expectancy.

01:31:59.460 --> 01:32:01.950
Three minutes away
from mom does wonders.

01:32:01.950 --> 01:32:04.570
An hour and a half of
being petted does not.

01:32:04.570 --> 01:32:07.390
That, in and of itself,
is interesting in terms

01:32:07.390 --> 01:32:10.560
of what counts as stimulation,
what counts as stress.

01:32:10.560 --> 01:32:12.640
OK, so hurray.

01:32:12.640 --> 01:32:15.050
What we've just
learned is just how

01:32:15.050 --> 01:32:18.040
generations of rat-petting
graduate students

01:32:18.040 --> 01:32:22.140
can influence the lineages of
rat brains and all of that.

01:32:22.140 --> 01:32:25.750
And what Meanie started
looking at with this phenomenon

01:32:25.750 --> 01:32:28.380
being one that was around
forever-- first identified

01:32:28.380 --> 01:32:30.850
around 1960 by a
guy named Seymour

01:32:30.850 --> 01:32:32.930
Levine in the Psychiatry
Department here,

01:32:32.930 --> 01:32:35.350
and no longer alive-- but
that started this whole world

01:32:35.350 --> 01:32:36.620
of neonatal handling.

01:32:36.620 --> 01:32:39.710
What Meanie did
was say, well, rats

01:32:39.710 --> 01:32:41.580
did not evolve, whatever
is going on here,

01:32:41.580 --> 01:32:43.460
for the purpose of
doctoral theses,

01:32:43.460 --> 01:32:48.610
what's the natural equivalent
in the world of a rodent?

01:32:48.610 --> 01:32:51.580
And it turns out that what
happens when you pick up

01:32:51.580 --> 01:32:54.080
a rat for three minutes and
do this and put it back,

01:32:54.080 --> 01:32:57.590
mom is all excited and
goes and checks out the pup

01:32:57.590 --> 01:33:03.480
and nestles it, and licks it,
and whatever other stuff there.

01:33:03.480 --> 01:33:05.380
And it has all this attention.

01:33:05.380 --> 01:33:08.110
Whereas, if you take the pup
out for an hour and a half,

01:33:08.110 --> 01:33:10.970
when you put him back
with mom, mom basically

01:33:10.970 --> 01:33:13.840
ignores the pup for
long periods of time.

01:33:13.840 --> 01:33:16.600
You're changing the
mother's behavior.

01:33:16.600 --> 01:33:19.120
OK, so that's an
indirect effect.

01:33:19.120 --> 01:33:21.600
And what he
proceeded to show was

01:33:21.600 --> 01:33:24.110
the critical thing about
the handling was not

01:33:24.110 --> 01:33:26.210
what you're doing to the
rat during that time,

01:33:26.210 --> 01:33:27.810
it's the fact that
you're causing

01:33:27.810 --> 01:33:32.530
dramatic changes in maternal
behavior based on that.

01:33:32.530 --> 01:33:33.670
So that's interesting.

01:33:33.670 --> 01:33:35.420
But that still doesn't
solve the problem

01:33:35.420 --> 01:33:38.590
of why did the system
evolve for grad students

01:33:38.590 --> 01:33:40.690
manipulating maternal behavior.

01:33:40.690 --> 01:33:42.430
And what he then
proceeded to look at

01:33:42.430 --> 01:33:46.700
was normal variation in
rat mothering styles,

01:33:46.700 --> 01:33:49.900
because some rat
mothers are-- OK,

01:33:49.900 --> 01:33:52.210
I know this is a
value judgement--

01:33:52.210 --> 01:33:55.990
but some rat mothers are better
mothers than other mothers.

01:33:55.990 --> 01:33:59.965
Some rat mothers, they
simply are better.

01:33:59.965 --> 01:34:00.590
They're better.

01:34:00.590 --> 01:34:02.100
They're nicer they
have better souls.

01:34:02.100 --> 01:34:02.600
[LAUGHTER]

01:34:02.600 --> 01:34:05.230
And in these rat mothers,
how do you determine that

01:34:05.230 --> 01:34:06.600
by these sorts of measures?

01:34:06.600 --> 01:34:08.030
Licking and grooming.

01:34:08.030 --> 01:34:10.730
How much time do you
spend licking your baby?

01:34:10.730 --> 01:34:13.230
And how much time do you
spend grooming your baby?

01:34:13.230 --> 01:34:15.040
And what Meanie
proceeded to show

01:34:15.040 --> 01:34:19.080
is that's what the neonatal
handling phenomenon was about.

01:34:19.080 --> 01:34:23.500
When you have moms who lick and
groom their kids an awful lot,

01:34:23.500 --> 01:34:27.110
what you do is produce the
same sort of better outcome.

01:34:27.110 --> 01:34:29.690
From the three minutes
of petting deal there,

01:34:29.690 --> 01:34:32.740
you get the kid who is
bigger, and healthier,

01:34:32.740 --> 01:34:34.240
and smarter, that sort of thing.

01:34:34.240 --> 01:34:37.090
Moms who hardly ever lick
and groom their pups,

01:34:37.090 --> 01:34:38.950
they produce pups
that, as adults,

01:34:38.950 --> 01:34:40.500
are like the ones
that were separated

01:34:40.500 --> 01:34:42.200
for an hour and a half a day.

01:34:42.200 --> 01:34:45.580
It is a reflection
of mothering style

01:34:45.580 --> 01:34:48.890
in the rats and the
variability there.

01:34:48.890 --> 01:34:53.920
Next thing he showed was that
this was multigenerational.

01:34:53.920 --> 01:34:58.700
If you lick and groom your
baby rat daughter a whole lot,

01:34:58.700 --> 01:35:02.740
as an adult, she will be
more of a licker and groomer.

01:35:02.740 --> 01:35:05.920
And he's already shown what some
of the neurological mechanisms

01:35:05.920 --> 01:35:06.655
are for that.

01:35:06.655 --> 01:35:08.570
For development,
what have we got?

01:35:08.570 --> 01:35:12.600
Yet again, one of these
non-Mendelian inheritance

01:35:12.600 --> 01:35:14.700
of traits deals going on.

01:35:14.700 --> 01:35:16.790
In this case, not even prenatal.

01:35:16.790 --> 01:35:20.780
Your early experience is going
to cause lifelong changes

01:35:20.780 --> 01:35:22.700
in your brain, which
will make you more

01:35:22.700 --> 01:35:25.610
likely to reproduce the
same early experience

01:35:25.610 --> 01:35:26.650
for your offspring.

01:35:26.650 --> 01:35:27.900
Off you go.

01:35:27.900 --> 01:35:30.030
The final thing he
did, which stands

01:35:30.030 --> 01:35:33.360
as a landmark in the field
of behavioral neurobiology,

01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:37.420
is he figured out what
the epigenetic change is.

01:35:37.420 --> 01:35:39.710
One of them, or
rather two of them

01:35:39.710 --> 01:35:42.980
is identified by now,
what gets changed

01:35:42.980 --> 01:35:46.670
by how mom often or
un-often licks you,

01:35:46.670 --> 01:35:48.150
grooms you, all of that?

01:35:48.150 --> 01:35:51.520
You change the access
of transcription factors

01:35:51.520 --> 01:35:57.420
relevant to activating
genes for making receptors

01:35:57.420 --> 01:36:02.350
for stress hormones, making
receptors for estrogen,

01:36:02.350 --> 01:36:05.570
making receptors for a whole
bunch of different hormones.

01:36:05.570 --> 01:36:08.240
Showing the epigenetic
changes there,

01:36:08.240 --> 01:36:12.340
that's how you go from moms
differing maternal style

01:36:12.340 --> 01:36:15.170
to lifelong differences
in expression

01:36:15.170 --> 01:36:17.840
of all sorts of genes.

01:36:17.840 --> 01:36:19.060
How's this?

01:36:19.060 --> 01:36:23.050
What you wind up seeing there
as this permanent mechanism,

01:36:23.050 --> 01:36:26.350
it is also reversible,
what he has since shown,

01:36:26.350 --> 01:36:28.570
which is you have a
baby rat who spends

01:36:28.570 --> 01:36:31.500
the first half of its
infancy with some totally

01:36:31.500 --> 01:36:35.446
terrible, negligent, distracted
mom who pays no attention

01:36:35.446 --> 01:36:36.570
and doesn't do any licking.

01:36:36.570 --> 01:36:41.110
Now cross-foster the pup
to a more attentive mother,

01:36:41.110 --> 01:36:44.380
and you can change the
epigenetic pattern.

01:36:44.380 --> 01:36:47.560
So all of this has
two themes going on.

01:36:47.560 --> 01:36:51.510
Early experience, causing
really persistent differences

01:36:51.510 --> 01:36:53.770
in how this stuff
works long after,

01:36:53.770 --> 01:36:57.630
and experience later on having
the potential to reverse

01:36:57.630 --> 01:36:58.320
some of this.

01:36:58.320 --> 01:37:02.520
All of this stuff, once again,
would be mistaken for genetic.

01:37:02.520 --> 01:37:04.590
What we have here
is what appears

01:37:04.590 --> 01:37:08.960
to be a genetic style of what
sort of mother rat you are.

01:37:08.960 --> 01:37:12.140
And it's not genes,
it's the mothering style

01:37:12.140 --> 01:37:15.860
setting up the offspring for
being a similar type of mother.

01:37:15.860 --> 01:37:18.910
Incredibly important
studies demonstrating this.

01:37:18.910 --> 01:37:21.460
What remains unclear
is how you get

01:37:21.460 --> 01:37:24.980
from mom licking you to
something epigenetic happening

01:37:24.980 --> 01:37:25.610
here.

01:37:25.610 --> 01:37:27.720
His crew is pounding
away at that.

01:37:27.720 --> 01:37:29.370
OK, so what have we
got at this point?

01:37:29.370 --> 01:37:31.680
We have gone through
over and over here--

01:37:31.680 --> 01:37:33.460
where have we gotten
to at this point?

01:37:33.460 --> 01:37:37.770
We've gone over and over here at
all of the classical techniques

01:37:37.770 --> 01:37:39.760
in the field of
behavior genetics,

01:37:39.760 --> 01:37:43.180
does it run in families,
adoptive studies,

01:37:43.180 --> 01:37:46.020
identical versus
monozygotic twins,

01:37:46.020 --> 01:37:47.190
twins separated at birth.

01:37:47.190 --> 01:37:49.090
We saw all of the
problems with it.

01:37:49.090 --> 01:37:52.130
And most dramatically,
most excitingly these days,

01:37:52.130 --> 01:37:54.130
prenatal environmental effects.

01:37:54.130 --> 01:37:57.940
We saw that trying to separate
maternal prenatal effects

01:37:57.940 --> 01:38:00.120
from paternal
genetic effects hits

01:38:00.120 --> 01:38:03.020
a wall, when you get all
of these weird-o hereditary

01:38:03.020 --> 01:38:06.910
things, including potentially
non-genetic Lamarckian

01:38:06.910 --> 01:38:08.380
inheritance of a trait.

01:38:08.380 --> 01:38:12.130
And what we've seen is how this
stuff playing out early in life

01:38:12.130 --> 01:38:14.560
has multigenerational
consequences.

01:38:14.560 --> 01:38:16.920
What we're going to pick
up with on Wednesday

01:38:16.920 --> 01:38:19.790
is now looking at how
people in this business

01:38:19.790 --> 01:38:24.140
find the actual genes, and
ultimately, gene environment

01:38:24.140 --> 01:38:28.630
interactions that make the last
two hours basically irrelevant.

01:38:28.630 --> 01:38:30.490
OK.

01:38:30.490 --> 01:38:33.760

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.982 --> 00:00:05.815
Stanford University.

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.030
Something incredibly cool I
just found out about yesterday,

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.910
which, oh, I wish I had
known about two days ago,

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.020
but still, it's useful.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.290
You remember those Siberian
foxes and that amazing thing?

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:30.240
You breed them for tameness,
purely on a behavioral trait,

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.800
and come back 30
generations later,

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.490
and they look like puppies.

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.630
They have the short muzzles,
and the big roundy eyes,

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:39.750
and the cute ears, and
they wag their tails

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.950
and all of that, punchline
there being, number one,

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.700
evolution can move really fast.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.360
Number two in some
interesting, mysterious way,

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.030
if you are selecting for
certain behavioral traits--

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.250
in this case, one where you
like being around humans

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.860
and are all cuddly with
them-- what you're also going

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.810
to select for are a
whole bunch of traits

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.530
that are associated with
baby wolves in terms

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:04.940
of physical appearance.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.920
Turns out, there's a flip side
of this going on right now

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.160
with what are known as metro
dogs, which are dogs that live

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.930
in the subway system in Moscow.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.320
And I don't know, but
they live in there,

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.120
and a whole deal was made out
of the number of them which

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.610
get on subways and know
which stops they're going to.

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.670
And there's an entire
website devoted

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.740
to metro dogs, which
are in Russian,

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.550
but it has lots
of nice pictures.

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.050
But what they're seeing
there is that these

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.050
are dogs who, essentially,
have been feral

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.670
and in feral packs for
decades and decades.

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.290
And what have they been
being selected for?

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.980
Being able to scrounge,
being, in fact, quite scared

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.880
of humans, a lot of the
time staying far from them

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.880
whenever possible because
they are raiding garbage

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.270
cans, who knows what.

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.290
And what they're seeing
in the metro dogs

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.620
is about 30 generations
into it now,

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.040
their tails are looking
more like the tails

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.430
you see on wolves.

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.500
Their muzzles are
getting longer.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.200
Their coat patterns
are beginning

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.980
to get less fancy and
distinctive from all

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:09.690
the different strains of dogs.

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.640
These guys are being selected
for the exact same traits that

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.120
went into being wolves.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.200
It's a really interesting
demonstration.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.190
Again, these guys are not
surviving because they've

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.740
got a different-shaped tail.

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.430
It's just part of the package.

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.660
If you were going to have
this canine-like thing

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.530
and be selected for
being scared of humans,

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.270
functioning in packs, having a
fairly aggressive temperament,

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.020
you're going to wind up looking
like a wolf after a while.

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.190
Same deal, again, very rapidly.

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.960
So unexpectedly,
Russia turns out

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.600
to be the motherland of all
sorts of interesting things

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.630
with puppies and puppies in the
past and puppies in the future

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.150
and all of that, so
that's wonderful.

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.650
OK.

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.530
However, I don't have
any pictures of them

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:02.150
that I've brought today,
but go to www.metrodog.edu

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.070
and see what they have to say.

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:06.800
OK, so picking up
on Monday's lecture,

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.280
I recognize Monday's lecture
was probably the first one

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.480
officially to be
able to blow half

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.100
of you guys out of
the water because it

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.160
was really tough material.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.060
Not only was it, as promised,
yet another disciplinary jump,

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.800
but it was the first
wave at a lot of material

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.460
that went by fairly fast,
and a lot of it quite subtle.

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:30.720
What are the things
to focus on in there?

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.020
What did we cover
Monday that's critical?

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.150
Behavior genetics as
an overall approach

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.720
is not doing the constructing
an evolutionary story.

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:40.790
Who's got the best story?

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:41.610
We win.

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.470
It's not molecular
genetics looking

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.530
at evolutionary change
driven by actual mutations

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.090
down at the molecular level.

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.150
Instead, it's looking
for patterns of behavior

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.550
that go along with relatedness.

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:01.200
What we saw was-- the most
completely useless version was,

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.710
well, here's a trait
that runs in a family,

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:06.110
and it runs in the family
more the more related

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:10.310
the individuals are--
completely useless, bringing

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:11.940
in the first of the
problems that we're

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.210
going to have nonstop
in the subject,

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:16.430
ruling out different
environments.

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.519
We saw a number of
the classic approaches

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.459
they have, which is
studying monozygotic

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.740
versus dizygotic twins,
studying adopted individuals,

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.430
or studying the gold standard
of identical twins separated

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.020
at birth, adopted, and then
brought back together again.

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.120
And in each one of
those cases, that's

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.040
explaining some degree of the
confusion, eliminating some

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.920
of the environment, but over,
and over, and over again,

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.150
this problem of environments
are sneaking in all sorts

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:47.360
of interesting ways.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.240
Adoption is nonrandom in terms
of where placement occurs.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.260
All sorts of stuff like that--
making it harder to tell.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.170
What we then transitioned
to was dealing

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:01.410
with the most interesting
realm of environment,

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:03.920
having influences, which
is this whole world

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:07.600
of prenatal environment and
environmental effects there,

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.030
one version of it being
this whole new field,

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:13.970
fetal origins of adult disease,
the fact that early events--

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:17.990
fetal environmental events--
can have lifelong consequences,

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:20.470
even multigenerational,
as we saw.

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:23.250
And people are understanding
the nuts and bolts

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:26.180
of how that might work,
that epigenetic stuff.

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.430
So we saw that as one--
a very subtle realm

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:32.420
of environment slipping in.

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:35.500
And we also saw examples
where "environment" could

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.720
be occurring within
an hour of birth,

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.570
and where environment
is occurring

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:43.070
despite seemingly like similar
things, like the number of math

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:46.430
classes you take-- environment
being very critical.

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:49.660
What we also saw, just to
make life a whole lot messier

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:51.860
and more complicated,
was violating

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.000
the rule we have all
known since infancy,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.560
which is you get equal genetic
input from each parent.

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:01.850
The business about mitochondria
coming from your mother--

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:05.880
the business about, as we
saw, more subtle version--

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:08.910
the same equal input
of genes, perhaps,

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:11.570
but the regulatory
control is much more

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:15.850
coming from the mother by way
of the transcription factors,

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:18.320
all of that and the
cytosol of the egg,

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:21.740
sperm having nothing interesting
going on from a cell biology

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:23.730
level, the egg
having all of this.

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:26.340
And where you can even
get something as nutty

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:31.260
as inheritance of an acquired
trait, Lamarckian evolution.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.220
OK, so that was plowing
through all of that,

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.840
and I'm fairly certain
that reviewing the last two

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:38.540
hours in these
last three minutes

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:40.500
has not put anybody
back in the water who

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:41.980
was blown out of the water.

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:46.310
So go to sections-- this
is difficult material,

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:48.110
and it's going to
get worse today.

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:49.460
OK, this is hard material.

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:51.970
Make sure you read the
extended notes because there's

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:55.030
a fighting chance that will be
more coherent than the lecture.

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:57.810
OK, so we got to
the point last time

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:01.750
around of seeing that,
OK, prenatal effects--

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:04.460
the last thing we focused on
was the actual nuts and bolts

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:07.170
of it, epigenetics, all of that.

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:11.930
Now we transition to what became
the much more modern, exciting

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:14.370
version of behavior
genetics, unless you happen

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:15.980
to have yourself
hundreds of pairs

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:18.490
of identical twins
separated at birth, which

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:22.820
is to go and actually find
the gene, finally beginning

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:27.430
to bring together-- to
marry the classical behavior

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:31.012
genetics approaches
with molecular biology.

00:07:31.012 --> 00:07:32.470
And it was starting
around the '80s

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:35.580
or so that people began
to be able to work

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:39.270
in actual molecular techniques
into this whole field,

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:41.920
and it started off in
a very primitive way

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.680
and has gotten much
better since then.

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:46.840
The version that you
can start off with

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:50.870
is you know something
about the trait,

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:53.100
or as we're really
saying here, you

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:55.620
know something about that
there are differences

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:58.090
in the trait among
different individuals,

00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:00.690
and now you go
looking for the gene.

00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:02.560
How do you do that?

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:04.590
The first classical
way of doing that

00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:07.820
is that you actually have
an observable difference

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:11.300
in two individuals,
in two populations,

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:13.770
in two branches of
the same family,

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:17.500
a difference in an external
manifestation of what's

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:19.130
going on with
genes, a difference

00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:23.490
in phenotype-- appearance,
behavior, some such thing.

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:26.290
And what you then do is
you use that approach

00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:29.630
to try to then find
genetic differences.

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:31.490
You get a whole
bunch of examples

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:34.100
of folks with one version,
a whole bunch of folks

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:36.679
with another version,
and you start looking

00:08:36.679 --> 00:08:38.850
for where the differences are.

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:41.020
Slightly more
constrained version,

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:43.549
you don't actually
have the phenotype.

00:08:43.549 --> 00:08:46.220
You are not looking
at eye color.

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:49.410
You are not looking at how
wrinkly somebody's face is.

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:52.940
You are not looking
at behavioral traits.

00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:55.140
You're not looking
at anything external.

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:58.120
The next more
focused step is now,

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:02.650
you're looking at proteins,
what some proteins do.

00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:07.110
Here is some enzyme that
turns this into that,

00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:10.190
and there's two different
ways the enzyme can do it

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:12.060
or two different variants on it.

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:14.522
And now, we've got
this bunch of people

00:09:14.522 --> 00:09:15.980
where we take their
blood and look,

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:17.430
and they've got this variant.

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:20.780
These guys have this version
of how the protein goes

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:22.180
about its business.

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:24.990
Can we find the
genetic difference?

00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:27.750
Next step down, next
step more frustrating--

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:30.970
when you can't see
external differences

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:32.190
that you're tracking.

00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:33.810
There is no
phenotypic difference

00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:35.870
that you've got to
work with, where

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:39.510
you don't know what the protein
does, what its function is.

00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:43.660
Next, lower rent version is to
look at the same protein that

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:46.930
comes in slightly
different sizes

00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:49.310
because that's usually
a hint that there

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:50.580
are different functions.

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:53.350
The way the protein
works is going to differ,

00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:55.670
and somewhere along
the way there,

00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:58.520
you came up with one
version by having

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:02.020
some insertion, mutation, or
deletion, or some such thing.

00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:03.776
You don't know what
the protein does,

00:10:03.776 --> 00:10:05.150
and you certainly
don't know what

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:07.520
that does in terms of the
individual's appearance,

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:10.510
behavior phenotype, but at
least you've got something

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:12.440
to work with there.

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:15.990
So what it is you are using as
your starting point-- easiest

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:17.450
external signs.

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:21.420
Next is what would be called
intermediate physiological

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:22.310
endpoints.

00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:24.800
Intermediate-- it's
something functional,

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:27.370
but it's not functional like
how the person functions.

00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:30.600
It's functional like how an
individual protein functions.

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:33.470
And then, if you're up the
creek with that, at least

00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:37.810
hopefully going for differences
in the size of the protein,

00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:40.650
the electrical charge
of the protein.

00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:44.250
For non-chemistry types, how
this version of the protein

00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:46.880
interacts with a
water environment

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:48.930
versus how that
version-- you don't

00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:51.000
know what the protein
does, but at least

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.700
you've got something
to work with.

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:54.370
You got a difference.

00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:56.650
In all of these
cases, the strategy

00:10:56.650 --> 00:10:59.680
is to then see what are
the gene differences that

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:00.970
go along with it?

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:05.270
Primitive initial version
would be as follows.

00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:07.060
You've got, for
example-- in this case,

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:11.640
you were trying to find
the gene for some disease.

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:13.180
And this is where
the whole field

00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:17.460
started because it is a lot
easier to go after a disease.

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:19.750
Either you have it
or you don't if you

00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:21.960
pick the right kind
of awful disease,

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:26.510
rather than going on a
phenotype like television taste.

00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:29.090
That one's going to be a lot
harder to find the gene for.

00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:33.620
The whole field started instead
looking at extremes of really

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:36.350
major league,
you-got-it-or-you-don't-have-it

00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:37.460
diseases.

00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:40.603
So you've got this family
that has this disease running

00:11:40.603 --> 00:11:45.090
in the family-- PKU,
phenylketonuria, for example,

00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:49.160
or Huntington's disease,
or cystic fibrosis.

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:51.180
These were some of
the first ones to go.

00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:53.580
And what you now do is
you've got the big family,

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:57.390
and what you want ideally is
a big huge family where about

00:11:57.390 --> 00:12:02.670
half the people have the
disease and half don't.

00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:05.160
And the initial way the
whole approach would be done

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.690
was you get blood samples
from everybody there,

00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:10.770
and you start sifting
through everybody's DNA,

00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:12.800
and you're looking
for a stretch of DNA

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:16.110
that everybody with a
disease has in common

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:20.080
and that none of the relatives
without the disease have.

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:21.670
And what you've
got at that point

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:25.820
is what would be called a
genetic marker because doing

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:29.400
it this way, you're just
sifting through a haystack.

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:32.240
You're just trying to pick
up big, crude patterns.

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:35.650
The difference that you wind
up seeing between these two

00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:38.970
populations of relatives
almost certainly-- in fact,

00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:41.490
as far as I know, never
once with this approach

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:44.520
had you just found
the individual gene.

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:46.600
You found a stretch
of DNA that's

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:49.030
got 10, 20, 30 genes in there.

00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:52.530
But somewhere in that stretch
is the interesting one.

00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:55.700
So at least you have
a genetic marker here.

00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:57.890
You know the
genetic neighborhood

00:12:57.890 --> 00:13:00.040
where the difference occurs.

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:03.190
So this was at one
point cutting edge,

00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:06.420
a technique called RFLP,
restriction fragment link

00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:07.360
polymorphisms.

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:08.760
Do not write that down.

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:11.280
And this technique
was incredibly

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:15.670
slick at some point early
on, and it is not easily done

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:20.930
because you are dumping
20,000 puzzle pieces over here

00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:22.960
and 20,000 there,
and you're looking

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:24.760
for the one difference
between the two

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:26.390
that's otherwise identical.

00:13:26.390 --> 00:13:28.160
It's that sort of task.

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:29.990
Nonetheless, using
that approach,

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:32.900
people began to
get disease markers

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:36.360
where they got the stretch
of DNA that contained

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:38.740
a whole bunch of genes
and who knows what else,

00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:41.180
but at least the
candidate gene, the gene

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:43.020
that was floating
around that was

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:45.930
responsible for this
disease, was somewhere

00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:48.260
in the stretch of DNA.

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:51.790
At that point, what would be
done is a number of things.

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:55.340
First is people would
obsessively, obsessively check

00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:59.800
their statistics to see just
how certain they are that this

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:02.240
is the genetic marker
for this disease

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:04.910
because you were soon
going to be advising people

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:07.760
whether to terminate
pregnancies based

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:09.640
on genetic tests like those.

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:14.260
This is an area where more
stringent rules were imposed

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:17.390
before you announce you think
you know how the universe works

00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:19.140
with respect to this disease.

00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:21.920
Really, really major
room for things

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:25.540
going wrong in terms of it
being then applied clinically,

00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:28.550
so first big demand
would be you really

00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:31.590
have to be much more certain--
a much more demanding field

00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:33.840
than lots of others in biology.

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:38.980
The next issue would be
this bioethics problem,

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:41.080
which is you've got
somebody from one

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:44.510
of these families who may
or may not have the disease.

00:14:44.510 --> 00:14:47.840
This is a disease that doesn't
get you until age whatever,

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:51.520
and you're younger than
that, and this immediately

00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:54.330
exploded this whole
issue for the first time.

00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:57.050
Should people get
tested if they have

00:14:57.050 --> 00:14:59.370
the genetic marker
for that disease,

00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:01.220
if they are a candidate for it?

00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:04.750
And this opened up a
whole world of confusion

00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:08.510
about this, where a key
feature of these debates

00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:11.720
was the fact that you
haven't gotten the gene.

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:14.850
You've just gotten the
candidate stretch of DNA,

00:15:14.850 --> 00:15:18.520
and there remains a very
small statistical chance

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:20.970
that you've got the wrong one.

00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:23.650
For a bunch of reasons,
there is that possibility.

00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:26.520
So do you let
somebody take a test?

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:29.360
Can people tell the difference
between a yes and no

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:31.240
and a statistical probability?

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:34.310
What do you do if it's a disease
where the person has just spent

00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:36.690
their last 10 years
watching their parents

00:15:36.690 --> 00:15:39.430
slowly die from it, and
there's no cure for it,

00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:40.810
and it's absolutely horrible?

00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:43.516
Do you give them a test that
is-- if the bad outcome is

00:15:43.516 --> 00:15:45.390
going to throw them off
the top of a building

00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:46.740
with a high likelihood?

00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:49.970
Enormously complex
bioethics issue.

00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:53.280
The third challenge, though,
was to step up the science

00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:55.550
from just having
the stretch of DNA

00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:59.270
with a bunch of genes in there
to actually find the gene.

00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:02.400
And in the years since, the
molecular biology has gotten

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:07.310
much, much better at moving
past finding a genetic marker,

00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:11.040
we are 99.9% certain that
the gene that's relevant

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:14.450
is somewhere in this stretch,
to finding the actual gene

00:16:14.450 --> 00:16:16.300
and then being
able to see what's

00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:19.060
the difference in it
between them and them.

00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:22.080
What's the difference,
down to base pairs?

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:23.660
Where is the mutation?

00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:25.430
Where's the difference
coming from?

00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:28.540
That's the world of
sequencing genomes now.

00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:30.570
That's where the field is at.

00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:34.480
So that has been enormously
powerful in terms

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:38.550
of potentially finding
one single gene.

00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:41.840
But everything that came through
in the molecular lectures

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:44.260
last week should be
pointing out there's

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:46.150
not a whole lot
going on in there

00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:49.770
that revolves around one
single gene at a time.

00:16:49.770 --> 00:16:52.570
So hold on to really
horrible diseases.

00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:55.660
Yeah, one gene, single
mutation, but most of what

00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:58.070
goes wrong, if you want
to start understanding

00:16:58.070 --> 00:17:03.120
the genetics of psychiatric
disorders, of diabetes,

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:07.099
of early-- of late-onset
dementias, things of that sort,

00:17:07.099 --> 00:17:09.390
it's not going to
be just one gene.

00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:11.710
So the next huge
advance in the field

00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:16.109
was being able to do searches
like these for multiple genes.

00:17:16.109 --> 00:17:18.800
One thing that has been
used is a technique called

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:21.369
microarrays, gene microarrays.

00:17:21.369 --> 00:17:24.150
And they were basically
invented here on campus by a guy

00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:27.720
over in the med school named
Pat Brown, who is already

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:29.880
very famous for
having done this and I

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:32.590
suspect has all sorts of
interesting awards coming

00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:33.960
for him down the line.

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:37.930
This spectacular technique-- you
take what is now called a gene

00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:41.320
chip, and through techniques
that are absolutely boggling

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:45.050
and make me feel queasy,
what you somehow manage to do

00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:48.580
is you get all the
copies of RNA that

00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:52.790
could be made in a cell
from this individual.

00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:54.830
If you are completely
new to this

00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:56.650
and you've managed
to get in this far

00:17:56.650 --> 00:17:59.350
without having to think
about what RNA is, ignore it.

00:17:59.350 --> 00:18:01.396
This is just sort of a
subtle detail for people

00:18:01.396 --> 00:18:02.520
who are interested in this.

00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:05.910
What you do is you get
a copy of each type

00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:08.170
of RNA made in a cell.

00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:12.420
You force the cell basically
to transcribe all of the genes

00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:13.160
it has.

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:15.100
And then you get
this little chip,

00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:18.730
and you basically glue the
end of each one of these RNAs

00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:21.100
to it, and you will
have a chip with 20,000

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:22.520
of these little things.

00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:25.030
And then you use
probes which will

00:18:25.030 --> 00:18:30.160
allow you to see which versions
of 20,000 of those genes

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:33.290
are different in this
individual from that individual.

00:18:33.290 --> 00:18:36.950
Total boggling, has
forced an entire new world

00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:40.780
of trying to analyze data,
this new field of informatics

00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:43.020
because you're not looking
at one gene at a time.

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:47.000
You're looking at patterns,
and that becomes a lot harder.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.060
That becomes
incredibly important

00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:53.240
because, again, it's all sorts
of the interesting stuff where

00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:54.490
it's not going to be one gene.

00:18:54.490 --> 00:18:55.330
It's a dozen.

00:18:55.330 --> 00:18:56.600
It's 100.

00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:59.490
So that has been one
challenging approach.

00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:03.730
Another is a technique called
QTLs, quantitative trait

00:19:03.730 --> 00:19:04.440
lowside.

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:06.660
What that basically
is built around--

00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:09.990
that if you have subtle enough
of tests, you could figure out

00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:14.550
this is a complex trait that
is modulated by two genes,

00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:17.510
or by three, or by 17.

00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:19.550
You can see all of this
going in the direction

00:19:19.550 --> 00:19:22.170
from techniques that
would let you know

00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:25.030
you're kind of in the
neighborhood of a gene,

00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:28.180
to actually identifying a gene
that differs between the two

00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:31.710
populations, to the much
more useful realistic world

00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:36.390
of whole bunches of genes,
networks going on at a time.

00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:38.330
So using these
approaches, people

00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:40.190
have made lots of progress.

00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:41.970
The most recent
version of that--

00:19:41.970 --> 00:19:44.260
I mentioned the other
day there, one type

00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:47.800
of mutation, a macro
mutation, is this business

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:52.770
about variants of major
stretches of DNA copy length

00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:54.720
variance, where a
whole stretch of DNA

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:58.250
is duplicated twice or
eleventy different times.

00:19:58.250 --> 00:20:01.250
Can you identify traits
that are occurring

00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:04.180
because of differences
in the number of copies?

00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:06.830
Yet another version
of dealing with

00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:11.560
this whole hierarchical,
multi-level business about gene

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:12.650
regulation.

00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:15.670
OK, take home message
from this is 20,

00:20:15.670 --> 00:20:17.640
30 years ago when
all of this started,

00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:21.830
you can start with a trait, and
through increasingly fancier

00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:24.960
techniques, you could find
the neighborhood of where

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:29.060
the gene is that the
different versions of the gene

00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:31.990
correspond to the different
versions of the trait-- moving

00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:35.450
from patterns of that to the
neighborhood of the genes

00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:38.310
to the actual gene to
whole bunches of genes

00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:42.060
to macro differences
there, that's one approach.

00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:43.830
The other approach
of the field has

00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:45.670
been starting the other way.

00:20:45.670 --> 00:20:47.220
You've got a gene.

00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:49.920
You've got a gene, and
thanks to researching it

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:53.350
in flies, and worms, and
rats, and all of that,

00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:55.880
you kind of have a sense
of what the gene does,

00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:59.380
and you have a reasonable
guess of what sort of traits

00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:01.850
might be relevant in
a human, and now you

00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:03.390
run it the other way.

00:21:03.390 --> 00:21:06.100
You have two different
versions of the gene,

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:09.180
and you look for
differences in behavior,

00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:11.350
or differences in
protein function,

00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:13.630
or differences in the
size of the protein.

00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:15.540
You start with the
genetic knowledge.

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:18.830
And for our purposes, where
people are mostly looking

00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:21.380
is at behavioral end points.

00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:23.050
So what do you see with that?

00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:26.570
Lots of findings in recent
years, and my feeling

00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:28.970
is this is one of the more
interesting ways of doing

00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:30.790
this behavior
genetics-- starting

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:32.820
with basic research
with animals.

00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:34.850
You've got some sense
of what the gene does.

00:21:34.850 --> 00:21:36.390
How about it in people?

00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:38.530
Because there is variability.

00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:42.700
First example, and this has to
do with a really interesting

00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:45.570
hormone that we will hear
plenty about down the line,

00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:47.860
a hormone called vasopressin.

00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:52.660
And vasopressin in rodents
I think I already discussed.

00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:57.110
Vasopressin in rodents has
a receptor, the vasopressin

00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:57.730
receptor.

00:21:57.730 --> 00:22:00.810
And what we talked about
the other week is depending

00:22:00.810 --> 00:22:03.200
on which version
of this you have,

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:06.020
if you happen to
be a vole male, it

00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:07.600
will determine
whether or not you

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:10.020
were monogamous or polygamous.

00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:11.180
That's interesting.

00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:14.090
What was also interesting
was that difference-- the two

00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:18.240
variants were not in the gene
itself but in the promoter,

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:22.140
and that winds up meaning that
the promoter caused in one

00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:27.080
strain the gene to be expressed
in different parts of the brain

00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:28.900
than in the other version of it.

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:32.570
OK, so what we saw there was all
sorts of hints from the animal

00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:37.320
world that vasopressin has stuff
to do with social affiliation,

00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:38.600
things of that sort.

00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:40.460
So what do you now do
if you want to apply

00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:42.080
this knowledge to humans?

00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:45.420
The first thing you
need to ask is, well,

00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:47.570
do we know where the
gene is in humans?

00:22:47.570 --> 00:22:50.370
And with modern sequencing
in the human genome,

00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:53.640
you've got it, so you know where
the gene is for the vasopressin

00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:54.460
receptor.

00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:56.040
And the next thing
you have to ask

00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:59.300
is, does it come in
two different flavors?

00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:01.170
Does it come in two
different flavors,

00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:03.690
and do they differ
in the same way

00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:06.930
as the ones people have
studied endlessly in rodents?

00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:07.720
Yay.

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:11.190
Yes, indeed, the receptor
gene is exactly the same

00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:13.350
in everyone, but there's
two different versions

00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:16.520
of the promoter--
the same exact story.

00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:17.810
So that's great.

00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:20.230
If you've gotten
that far, now you

00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:22.970
start looking for what
the differences are

00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:27.340
between people who have one
variant versus the other.

00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:28.840
And you've got to
do your homework.

00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:33.390
You got to match them for
age, and gender, and number

00:23:33.390 --> 00:23:35.520
of cavities, and all
sorts of stuff like that.

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:37.150
And when you've got
that under control,

00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:39.250
you go looking for behaviors.

00:23:39.250 --> 00:23:40.930
What's the limit of this?

00:23:40.930 --> 00:23:43.330
By definition, you're
only looking where

00:23:43.330 --> 00:23:44.830
the light is shining already.

00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:46.480
You're only looking
where you already

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:49.380
have a sense that maybe
you should be looking,

00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:51.440
unless you're totally
crazy-obsessive

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:54.430
and want to try to measure
everything possible in people

00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:55.800
and look for a difference.

00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:59.004
In most of these studies, you
kind of know where to look.

00:23:59.004 --> 00:24:00.670
That immediately means
there's all sorts

00:24:00.670 --> 00:24:02.280
of areas you're not looking.

00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:04.200
Nonetheless, with
this approach, people

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:08.080
have gone looking in humans
at these different variants

00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:10.690
on the vasopressin
receptor gene,

00:24:10.690 --> 00:24:13.910
and you find some really
interesting differences.

00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:17.220
One was a paper published
a couple years ago

00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:19.330
in a very prestigious
journal, which

00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:22.050
got picked up in the papers
all over the universe,

00:24:22.050 --> 00:24:25.690
showing if you have the
version of the promoter

00:24:25.690 --> 00:24:30.340
that you find in monogamous
male voles, you as a human male

00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:34.470
are likely to have more stable
relationships than if you

00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:36.420
have the other version of it.

00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:37.690
Whoa.

00:24:37.690 --> 00:24:39.700
That's pretty bizarre.

00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:41.050
That's pretty cool.

00:24:41.050 --> 00:24:43.300
Next thing, a study
that just came out

00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:46.050
in that same prestigious
journal a couple of weeks ago,

00:24:46.050 --> 00:24:47.660
and this is one
we're showing, which,

00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:50.920
depending on which version
you have, how good are you

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:54.030
reading facial expressions
in other people?

00:24:54.030 --> 00:24:56.780
Subtle differences in
facial expressions--

00:24:56.780 --> 00:25:00.010
then, there's a whole
other world of approaching,

00:25:00.010 --> 00:25:04.590
evidence emerging that in
families where autism runs

00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:08.820
majorly through the families,
people are seeing mutations

00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:13.010
in genes related to vasopressin
and the vasopressin receptor.

00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:15.480
So this is one
really cool example

00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:17.760
of starting with that
approach, and this

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:20.420
is a gene whose
variants have something

00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:23.280
to do with some pretty
meaningful realms

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:27.380
of human social connectiveness,
variability stuff.

00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:29.150
Totally interesting.

00:25:29.150 --> 00:25:34.340
Another example-- this is
a gene coding for a protein

00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:39.274
called BDNF, brain-derived
neurotrophic factor.

00:25:39.274 --> 00:25:40.190
Doesn't really matter.

00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:44.030
The main point of BDNF
is it prompts neurons

00:25:44.030 --> 00:25:47.320
into growing new processes.

00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:49.950
And it turns out, BDNF does
something that ultimately

00:25:49.950 --> 00:25:51.640
is kind of a drag for you.

00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:53.836
In one part of the
brain, the amygdala,

00:25:53.836 --> 00:25:55.960
which-- I think I've already
mentioned the amygdala

00:25:55.960 --> 00:26:00.280
has a lot to do with fear and
anxiety and that sort of thing,

00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:01.820
and we will come back to that.

00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:02.630
Don't panic.

00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:08.390
But the main thing is BDNF plays
a role in causing individuals--

00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:12.580
individual rats-- when they
are highly stressed to make

00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:16.980
the neurons in the amygdala grow
new connections, new processes.

00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:18.100
What are you doing?

00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:20.420
You are training that
rat to be anxious.

00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:22.790
You are training that rat
to be hyper-responsive

00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:24.130
to scary things.

00:26:24.130 --> 00:26:27.170
BDNF appears to play this role.

00:26:27.170 --> 00:26:30.030
So now, the next step in
this sequence-- and you'll

00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:33.060
begin to see it's the same
pattern over and over-- people

00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:37.430
then found, ah, there's a couple
of different flavors of BDNF.

00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:40.320
There are a couple of
different genetic variants.

00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:41.860
There's a couple
of different ways

00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:45.750
in which BDNF pops up in
rats or mice or whatever,

00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:50.020
differing by a base pair
here, an amino acid there,

00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:53.330
where you then do your
scutwork and show, OK,

00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:59.200
this BDNF works faster than that
version of it or it works less

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:01.820
but it lasts longer,
or who knows what.

00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:03.710
You find a functional
difference.

00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:05.620
There's a genetic difference.

00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:07.274
There's two different
versions of it,

00:27:07.274 --> 00:27:08.690
and it actually
makes a difference

00:27:08.690 --> 00:27:10.280
for how the protein functions.

00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:12.450
And this has all been
studied in animals,

00:27:12.450 --> 00:27:16.360
and now you understand what it's
doing in the amygdala of a rat,

00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:17.910
depending on which
version you have.

00:27:17.910 --> 00:27:20.920
And then the exact
same strategy--

00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:24.720
go look at the BDNF gene
in humans and ask, well,

00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:26.930
do you see the same difference?

00:27:26.930 --> 00:27:29.620
Are the same two
flavors in humans

00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:30.900
popping up as in rodents?

00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:31.820
Yes, indeed.

00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:34.150
And then, the exact
same approach again,

00:27:34.150 --> 00:27:37.240
looking for differences, and
you know where to start looking.

00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:39.340
What has that
literature been showing?

00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:42.360
The type of BDNF
variant that you

00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:45.890
have in the exact same way
that it maps in rodents maps

00:27:45.890 --> 00:27:49.550
onto your likelihood
of an anxiety disorder,

00:27:49.550 --> 00:27:52.870
the levels of stress
hormones in your bloodstream,

00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:56.980
the levels of metabolic
activity in your amygdala,

00:27:56.980 --> 00:27:59.460
the same exact sort of finding.

00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:02.560
Next, a whole other
world, which we will learn

00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:04.090
much more about down the line.

00:28:04.090 --> 00:28:06.390
This is obviously a quick
survey of a whole bunch

00:28:06.390 --> 00:28:07.290
of different areas.

00:28:07.290 --> 00:28:09.820
All of these we will
come back to big time

00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:11.010
later on in the course.

00:28:11.010 --> 00:28:13.550
Next area, this
neurotransmitter,

00:28:13.550 --> 00:28:17.220
dopamine-- you will learn
amazing amounts about dopamine.

00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:19.250
Dopamine, which
works through a-- you

00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:22.190
guessed it-- dopamine
receptor-- and in fact, there

00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:25.370
is a gazillion different
types of dopamine receptors.

00:28:25.370 --> 00:28:28.930
And dopamine
receptor number four,

00:28:28.930 --> 00:28:32.040
D4, the dopamine
receptor four gene

00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:35.180
has something to do with a whole
bunch of interesting traits

00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:36.380
in rodents.

00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:40.250
And it comes with variability
in the rodent versions,

00:28:40.250 --> 00:28:43.240
different flavors, and
humans have variability

00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:44.650
along similar lines.

00:28:44.650 --> 00:28:47.520
And dopamine-- what is
dopamine involved in?

00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:54.030
Pleasure, and anticipation,
and reward-seeking behavior.

00:28:54.030 --> 00:28:57.190
What two different versions
of the dopamine type

00:28:57.190 --> 00:29:02.210
four, the D4 receptor gene,
begin to map onto in humans?

00:29:02.210 --> 00:29:07.960
Levels of risk-taking behavior,
levels of sensation seeking,

00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:11.390
levels of novelty craving.

00:29:11.390 --> 00:29:13.330
That's interesting.

00:29:13.330 --> 00:29:18.200
Another example, a gene
called NPY-- a protein,

00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:22.330
a neurotransmitter called
neuropeptide Y. Do not get

00:29:22.330 --> 00:29:23.740
overwhelmed by all of these.

00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:26.050
It's just the same
pattern over and over.

00:29:26.050 --> 00:29:30.590
NPY, same deal again-- and
two different human variants

00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:33.760
have something to do with
differences in levels,

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:38.760
again, of anxiety, of metabolic
rates in the amygdala,

00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:40.500
all of that.

00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:42.150
And in this case,
the NPY difference

00:29:42.150 --> 00:29:43.910
is quite interesting
because it's

00:29:43.910 --> 00:29:45.810
one of those where
the difference is not

00:29:45.810 --> 00:29:47.950
in the gene structure sequence.

00:29:47.950 --> 00:29:50.530
It's once again a
difference in the promoter.

00:29:50.530 --> 00:29:53.270
OK, so what have we
have in all of these?

00:29:53.270 --> 00:29:55.470
This is a really
powerful approach.

00:29:55.470 --> 00:29:57.590
The first version
that we heard, you've

00:29:57.590 --> 00:29:59.190
got a behavioral difference.

00:29:59.190 --> 00:30:01.880
You've got a
phenotypic difference.

00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:05.040
You've got a difference in
how two proteins function,

00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:06.120
or their size.

00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:09.520
Go looking for what's the
genetic difference between

00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:11.910
those who have this trait
and those who don't.

00:30:11.910 --> 00:30:14.350
This version, reverse
engineering it,

00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:18.310
you start off with a gene that
comes in different flavors.

00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:20.850
You got a sense of what it
does from animal studies.

00:30:20.850 --> 00:30:23.810
Do you have the same
variation in humans,

00:30:23.810 --> 00:30:25.770
and does it map onto behavior?

00:30:25.770 --> 00:30:27.720
So all of these are amazing.

00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:29.980
All of these, it
has to be emphasized

00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:32.290
in a way that will come
back to haunt us also

00:30:32.290 --> 00:30:37.100
big time-- all of these
explain tiny percentages

00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:40.040
of the variability in the data.

00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:42.270
There is nothing
remotely resembling

00:30:42.270 --> 00:30:45.220
a world in which
if you have flavor

00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:48.790
vanilla of the D4 receptor
versus if you have flavor

00:30:48.790 --> 00:30:50.970
chocolate-- if you
have flavor vanilla,

00:30:50.970 --> 00:30:54.560
you are going to be hand gliding
when you are in preschool.

00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:56.890
You're going to be
totally sensation seeking.

00:30:56.890 --> 00:30:58.399
And if you have
the other version,

00:30:58.399 --> 00:31:00.440
you're going to spend your
entire life collecting

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:02.510
stamps or who knows what.

00:31:02.510 --> 00:31:04.270
It's not that deterministic.

00:31:04.270 --> 00:31:06.930
No surprise with
this gene stuff.

00:31:06.930 --> 00:31:10.560
No single gene is going to
be particularly deterministic

00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:14.300
once you get outside the
world of phenylketonuria

00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:16.160
and cystic fibrosis and such.

00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:19.900
They contribute some
explanatory power.

00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:24.620
So on one hand, amazingly cool,
seeing these genetic links

00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:26.850
to aspects of human behavior.

00:31:26.850 --> 00:31:29.540
On the other hand, they're
not very big effects,

00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:31.190
and this is something
we will come back

00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:33.020
to endlessly down the line.

00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:38.030
OK, so this is how the field has
gone about more recently trying

00:31:38.030 --> 00:31:43.320
to find links between variation
in genes or their promoters

00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:47.740
and variations in aspect of
behavior, running it both ways.

00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:50.020
And what all of
this is looking at,

00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:51.880
what is intrinsic
in everything we've

00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:53.900
been talking about with
this behavior genetics,

00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:56.960
is oh, my God, the
cliche finally emerges.

00:31:56.960 --> 00:32:00.690
Nature and nurture, and
gene and environment,

00:32:00.690 --> 00:32:02.630
and gene/environment
interactions--

00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:05.500
what is becoming increasingly
clear in the field

00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:09.170
is there's a third
leg to all of this.

00:32:09.170 --> 00:32:12.550
There's a third leg that
could be extremely powerful

00:32:12.550 --> 00:32:16.000
and is going to be the basis
for the chaos and complexity

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.280
lectures down the
line, which is chance,

00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:22.360
the role of random
events, the role

00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:27.300
of chance in being a form that
transcends what we would call

00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:30.300
environment and is
certainly not genetics,

00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:33.240
a whole different world
where that contributes.

00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:37.290
OK, where will we see chance
playing out an important role

00:32:37.290 --> 00:32:38.400
in all of this?

00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:43.270
Brownian motion-- for those who
don't have a techie background,

00:32:43.270 --> 00:32:45.490
I will describe it in the
way that I understand it,

00:32:45.490 --> 00:32:47.300
which is flailing desperately.

00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:51.310
Brownian motion has to do
with the fact that molecules

00:32:51.310 --> 00:32:56.380
oscillate and use an intrinsic
movement, oscillation,

00:32:56.380 --> 00:32:57.600
of molecules.

00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:59.890
You take a whatever
full of water

00:32:59.890 --> 00:33:02.830
filled with all sorts of
things-- molecules, whatever--

00:33:02.830 --> 00:33:04.550
and they're all
going to be vibrating

00:33:04.550 --> 00:33:07.680
to a certain extent because
of this Brownian motion.

00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:11.180
I suspect that was the most
amazingly incorrect description

00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:13.830
of what Brownian motion
is, but that's the point.

00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:17.480
That's the main point, simply
that there is this oscillation,

00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:19.820
which is completely random.

00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:22.310
It is just an intrinsic
feature of how

00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:26.430
the world of physics and Albert
Einstein's mustache works.

00:33:26.430 --> 00:33:29.750
And so you've got this
Brownian motion stuff going on.

00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:33.190
So where might that play
out in terms of chance?

00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:39.300
So we got here a cell with our
four powerhouses of the cell

00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:39.860
here.

00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:42.890
And on the right-- let's assume
this is a genetically identical

00:33:42.890 --> 00:33:45.810
cell, and I just got tired
of drawing it completely--

00:33:45.810 --> 00:33:47.690
but the same four mitochondria.

00:33:47.690 --> 00:33:51.050
And what we see here
first off is genetically,

00:33:51.050 --> 00:33:53.070
these mitochondria differ.

00:33:53.070 --> 00:33:54.380
One of them has a blue spot.

00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:55.630
One of them has a red sweater.

00:33:55.630 --> 00:33:57.160
Wait a second.

00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:59.740
Every single cell in
your body was built out

00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:02.960
of the same genome when
you started off life.

00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:03.760
Ah-ha.

00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:05.770
Back to that thing
the other day.

00:34:05.770 --> 00:34:08.870
Mitochondria have their own DNA.

00:34:08.870 --> 00:34:11.480
Mitochondria are going
about their own business

00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:14.710
of dividing in the
cell, of replicating

00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:18.800
their-- replicating themselves
now and then with a mutation.

00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:23.550
Within any given cell, the
mitochondrial sequence of DNA

00:34:23.550 --> 00:34:26.179
is going to differ from
one mitochondria to another

00:34:26.179 --> 00:34:28.949
because they've been
separate organisms that

00:34:28.949 --> 00:34:32.400
are inside a cell going
about their own evolution,

00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:34.770
their own mutations,
their own whatever.

00:34:34.770 --> 00:34:36.909
What you then
have-- what would be

00:34:36.909 --> 00:34:41.280
called a mosaic of
different genetic profiles

00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:44.070
of the mitochondria
within a cell.

00:34:44.070 --> 00:34:46.929
So that in and of itself
is pretty interesting

00:34:46.929 --> 00:34:49.040
because this is a
whole other world.

00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:52.909
This is not the DNA
back in the nucleus,

00:34:52.909 --> 00:34:55.630
and this is not
variability introduced

00:34:55.630 --> 00:34:59.580
by jumping genes or
accessibility of transcription

00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:01.120
factors to genes, all that.

00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:03.730
This is-- meanwhile,
outside the nucleus,

00:35:03.730 --> 00:35:07.070
there's this whole weirdo world
of these mitochondria that

00:35:07.070 --> 00:35:08.780
are functioning
all on their own,

00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:11.830
so the different
mitochondria in the same cell

00:35:11.830 --> 00:35:14.720
will have different
genetic makeups.

00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:15.620
So great.

00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:17.930
So these two cells are
absolutely identical.

00:35:17.930 --> 00:35:20.810
Each of them have four
mitochondria, and each of them

00:35:20.810 --> 00:35:22.650
have two red kinds,
one blue kind,

00:35:22.650 --> 00:35:24.250
and one that gets nothing.

00:35:24.250 --> 00:35:28.700
So now that cell is going to
go about splitting in two.

00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:33.550
And what happens is it splits.

00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:37.260
And in the process of splitting,
what the fluid, the cytosol,

00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:40.250
the stuff inside where all
the molecules-- including

00:35:40.250 --> 00:35:43.140
the mitochondria in the
other organelles-- are found.

00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:45.630
And it splits,
and there winds up

00:35:45.630 --> 00:35:47.180
being a very simple question.

00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:51.890
Which mitochondria wind
up in which daughter cell?

00:35:51.890 --> 00:35:56.460
And what we've got here is in
this case, a split like that.

00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:58.580
In this case, a split like that.

00:35:58.580 --> 00:35:59.900
Oh my god, why did that happen?

00:35:59.900 --> 00:36:02.220
Is that because there is
a gene in this one that

00:36:02.220 --> 00:36:06.460
says when you form a new pair
of cells, have blue and blank

00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:08.110
in one and two
reds in the other?

00:36:08.110 --> 00:36:11.900
And this one is a completely
different instruction manual

00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:13.270
for how you split cells.

00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:17.360
No, simple randomness of
where the mitochondria were

00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:19.390
in the cell when they split.

00:36:19.390 --> 00:36:22.110
A totally random event.

00:36:22.110 --> 00:36:24.830
So what you see here
is you start off

00:36:24.830 --> 00:36:28.320
with two cells that are
genetically identical.

00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:31.270
And within one round
of cell splitting,

00:36:31.270 --> 00:36:33.710
these genetically
identical individuals

00:36:33.710 --> 00:36:36.080
are already
genetically different.

00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:37.040
How come?

00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:39.010
Because of instructions
or a blueprint?

00:36:39.010 --> 00:36:39.560
No.

00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:42.950
Simply because
molecules, organelles,

00:36:42.950 --> 00:36:45.340
things like mitochondria
just oscillating around.

00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:48.700
And along comes a split, and
who is stuck on which side

00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:49.690
of the divide.

00:36:49.690 --> 00:36:52.600
So you've got
variability that way.

00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:56.100
Intrinsic in that is another
type of variability, which

00:36:56.100 --> 00:36:57.490
the second I
mention it, you will

00:36:57.490 --> 00:36:59.660
be able to run
with effortlessly,

00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:02.740
which is floating
around in here also

00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:07.670
will be transcription
factors, and splicing enzymes,

00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:09.320
and other enzymes.

00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:11.860
And along comes the split.

00:37:11.860 --> 00:37:13.910
And there is not
the remotest chance

00:37:13.910 --> 00:37:17.320
that half of every single
type of transcription factor

00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:20.110
is going to go each way, and
half of every type of splicing

00:37:20.110 --> 00:37:21.690
enzyme, et cetera.

00:37:21.690 --> 00:37:24.060
It's going to be who's
oscillating where

00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:26.110
and where the cells splits.

00:37:26.110 --> 00:37:30.090
So you wind up not only
with different outcomes

00:37:30.090 --> 00:37:32.317
in terms of mitochondria
and their genetic makeup,

00:37:32.317 --> 00:37:34.150
you're going to have
different distributions

00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:36.330
of different types of
transcription factors.

00:37:36.330 --> 00:37:40.790
All due to this random
oscillatory stuff.

00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:44.150
So that's one big component
where chance plays a role.

00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:46.310
And what the chaos
complexity lectures

00:37:46.310 --> 00:37:48.120
are going to be
very heavily about

00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:50.530
is just how important
stuff like this

00:37:50.530 --> 00:37:55.440
is, how important it is in
explaining what goes on,

00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:58.610
how important it is in
explaining why, no matter

00:37:58.610 --> 00:38:01.780
how much you know about what
every single molecule is having

00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:03.850
for lunch next
Tuesday, there's still

00:38:03.850 --> 00:38:07.100
going to be a huge degree
of unpredictability.

00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:08.520
All of that is to come.

00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:11.770
This is just beginning to
establish the idea yes, nature,

00:38:11.770 --> 00:38:13.130
nurture, nature, nurture.

00:38:13.130 --> 00:38:16.960
Chance also is the third leg
in there playing a large role.

00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:20.020
Whether chance is
what's going on when

00:38:20.020 --> 00:38:23.270
you get a transposable event--
you remember at the point

00:38:23.270 --> 00:38:26.220
that neural stem cells
are beginning to divide

00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:27.190
into neurons.

00:38:27.190 --> 00:38:30.270
That's when they juggle around
their transposable genes

00:38:30.270 --> 00:38:31.430
most dramatically.

00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:34.840
Whether that is a completely
random event as to where

00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:37.710
the copies land when
they come back to Earth,

00:38:37.710 --> 00:38:39.400
I'm not sure if people know.

00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:42.580
But I suspect there's an
element of chance in there also.

00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:45.560
So this is introducing
that notion in there.

00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:46.230
So great.

00:38:46.230 --> 00:38:48.460
So now you've got
all these caviats,

00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:51.020
which is environment
is subtle and coming

00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:53.350
all over the place,
and early experience,

00:38:53.350 --> 00:38:57.100
and epigenetic changes, and all
the different ways you could

00:38:57.100 --> 00:38:59.160
find genes linked to behavior.

00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:01.190
And don't forget,
variability also

00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:02.780
has something to do with chance.

00:39:02.780 --> 00:39:04.640
At the end of the
day though, what

00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:07.060
all of the behavior
genetic approach

00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:10.930
is going to come down to at
the end is a single number.

00:39:10.930 --> 00:39:15.030
We have studied this trait
with adoption techniques,

00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:18.500
with looking for
genetic markers,

00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:21.780
with looking for
copy length variance.

00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:25.510
We have studied this trait
and the variability of it.

00:39:25.510 --> 00:39:28.240
And thanks to us studying
for a gazillion years,

00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:34.100
we can now conclude that 53.5%
percent of the variability

00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:36.390
in this trait is heritable.

00:39:36.390 --> 00:39:39.040
You come up with this
number at the end.

00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:43.730
This trait has a
53% heritability.

00:39:43.730 --> 00:39:46.240
That's the number that
winds up coming out.

00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:49.420
Scientists report that
this or that trait

00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:53.170
has variability as
80% heritability.

00:39:53.170 --> 00:39:56.230
This is the number that
always comes out at the end.

00:39:56.230 --> 00:39:58.460
What's the heritability?

00:39:58.460 --> 00:40:02.870
Ranging somewhere
from 0% up to 100%.

00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:05.230
This is heritability.

00:40:05.230 --> 00:40:07.600
And this is absolutely critical.

00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:11.290
Because this is a truly
influential number.

00:40:11.290 --> 00:40:13.180
The one that people
come away with when

00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:17.440
they are being taught,
Oh, this trait is genetic.

00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:18.960
Those who want to
be quantitative

00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:22.520
will have been told, Whoa this
trait has 80% heritability.

00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:25.340
It has 90% heritability,
all of that.

00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:28.204
And it's the wrong
interpretation.

00:40:28.204 --> 00:40:30.370
And what we're going to
spend a bunch of time on now

00:40:30.370 --> 00:40:33.740
is looking at what
heritability actually means.

00:40:33.740 --> 00:40:35.830
The heritability
number-- because it

00:40:35.830 --> 00:40:39.170
is completely different
from the everyday intuition

00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:40.080
about what it means.

00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:42.070
And what it's
usually telling you

00:40:42.070 --> 00:40:46.520
is how unimportant genes are
in the deterministic way rather

00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:47.780
than the other way around.

00:40:47.780 --> 00:40:48.280
OK.

00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:50.130
So what does everyone assume?

00:40:50.130 --> 00:40:52.830
What is heritability
telling you?

00:40:52.830 --> 00:40:55.630
It is telling you
how much do genes

00:40:55.630 --> 00:40:59.830
determine the average
level of this trait.

00:40:59.830 --> 00:41:04.430
You have one version of a gene,
and there's the other flavor.

00:41:04.430 --> 00:41:09.790
And they produce different
average levels of some behavior

00:41:09.790 --> 00:41:10.970
or something at the end.

00:41:10.970 --> 00:41:13.510
What heritability
is teaching you,

00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:15.570
if you've got this
completely wrong notion,

00:41:15.570 --> 00:41:17.920
it's teaching you
how much do genes

00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:22.300
have to do with the average
level of that behavior,

00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:23.890
that trait, that whatever.

00:41:23.890 --> 00:41:26.700
That's not what
heritability actually means.

00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:29.600
What heritability as
a number is telling

00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:33.270
you is not what genes have
to do with the average level

00:41:33.270 --> 00:41:35.530
of the trait, it's
what genes have

00:41:35.530 --> 00:41:38.980
to do with the
degree of variability

00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:41.800
around that average.

00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:44.020
This is a point where
things immediately

00:41:44.020 --> 00:41:48.920
seem panicky and start getting
very, very complicated,

00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:49.890
all of that.

00:41:49.890 --> 00:41:51.930
We will see it's not that bad.

00:41:51.930 --> 00:41:53.890
And it's not that bad
in a very critical way.

00:42:00.730 --> 00:42:02.860
OK, simple first sense
of getting at it.

00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:06.310
Here's two populations where
you measure something or other.

00:42:06.310 --> 00:42:09.950
And these three individuals,
they come in at nine, 10, 11.

00:42:09.950 --> 00:42:12.740
And these come in at one,
10, and 19, or whatever.

00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:13.750
What's going on here?

00:42:13.750 --> 00:42:14.880
You average them.

00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:17.260
They have the
exact same average.

00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:18.500
What's the difference?

00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:21.590
There's a lot more
variability around the average

00:42:21.590 --> 00:42:23.570
here than in this case.

00:42:23.570 --> 00:42:25.680
What's the wrong
idea that people

00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:28.300
have that heritability means?

00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:31.490
It's telling you
how much do genes

00:42:31.490 --> 00:42:33.990
determine the average here.

00:42:33.990 --> 00:42:35.400
That's not what it's doing.

00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:40.790
It's how much do genes determine
how much variability there is.

00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:43.830
Initially, this seems
like a very subtle point.

00:42:43.830 --> 00:42:44.912
And what's the big deal?

00:42:44.912 --> 00:42:46.370
Because at the end
of the day, it's

00:42:46.370 --> 00:42:48.660
still talking about how
important genes are.

00:42:48.660 --> 00:42:50.960
What we'll see now
is it's actually

00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:54.140
a way of seeing how less
deterministic genes are

00:42:54.140 --> 00:42:55.770
in lots of cases.

00:42:55.770 --> 00:42:59.150
So this heritability stuff,
talking about variants.

00:42:59.150 --> 00:43:01.045
Here we have an example.

00:43:06.330 --> 00:43:09.740
We've got some plant.

00:43:09.740 --> 00:43:12.280
Some plant with
some gene that comes

00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:13.960
in three different flavors.

00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:17.130
And you measure something
or other about the plant.

00:43:17.130 --> 00:43:20.500
This is how much
water it retains,

00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:22.830
or of the plant's IQ,
or something like that.

00:43:22.830 --> 00:43:25.500
You're measuring some
trait, and you're asking,

00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:28.960
Does it differ as a function
of which version of this gene

00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:29.620
you have?

00:43:29.620 --> 00:43:32.250
So you do your study,
and this is what you see.

00:43:32.250 --> 00:43:33.710
And you say, Whoa, OK.

00:43:33.710 --> 00:43:36.210
I went and looked at this
plant in a rain forest,

00:43:36.210 --> 00:43:38.730
and we identified the
genetic versions of it.

00:43:38.730 --> 00:43:42.300
And look-- very different.

00:43:42.300 --> 00:43:45.900
The gene that you have
there, knowing that,

00:43:45.900 --> 00:43:47.780
gives you a lot of
predictive power

00:43:47.780 --> 00:43:51.000
over what level of
whatever it is that you're

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:52.720
measuring this plant is.

00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:53.670
That's great.

00:43:53.670 --> 00:43:55.890
So you're going to get
your doctorate out of that,

00:43:55.890 --> 00:43:57.352
and you get some publications.

00:43:57.352 --> 00:43:59.560
And it's great, and you
finally stop being a student.

00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:00.590
And it's terrific.

00:44:00.590 --> 00:44:03.440
And meanwhile,
some individual who

00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:05.760
shares like none of
your genes in common

00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:08.240
on the other side of
the planet, meanwhile

00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:11.230
there are some S-O-B who's
studying the exact same plant

00:44:11.230 --> 00:44:13.350
in the middle of
the Gobi Desert.

00:44:13.350 --> 00:44:15.710
You're sitting here in
the Amazon studying this,

00:44:15.710 --> 00:44:18.680
and here's this individual
doing the exact same kind

00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:20.690
of experiment,
saying, Oh, here we

00:44:20.690 --> 00:44:23.310
have this unlikely plant
that grows both in the Amazon

00:44:23.310 --> 00:44:24.390
and the Gobi Desert.

00:44:24.390 --> 00:44:26.720
But here we have this, and
we're studying this here.

00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:28.320
And what am I studying?

00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:31.160
I'm studying those
three variants.

00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:33.610
Those three variants
of this gene.

00:44:33.610 --> 00:44:38.200
And I'm asking do they
influence plant IQ?

00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:40.770
The same thing that you
were asking over here.

00:44:40.770 --> 00:44:43.420
And that individual
was doing their study,

00:44:43.420 --> 00:44:46.910
and they see that yes,
indeed, the gene influences

00:44:46.910 --> 00:44:48.450
what version that you have.

00:44:48.450 --> 00:44:51.270
And here you had A,
B, and C. And here's

00:44:51.270 --> 00:44:55.330
what they see when
they measure plant IQ.

00:44:55.330 --> 00:44:57.550
And it looks like that.

00:44:57.550 --> 00:44:59.130
And what do they conclude?

00:44:59.130 --> 00:45:00.660
Whoa, look at that.

00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:02.700
Knowing what version
of the gene you

00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:05.290
have gives me enormous
predictive power

00:45:05.290 --> 00:45:08.890
in predicting what the
plant IQ is going to be.

00:45:08.890 --> 00:45:12.840
And then catastrophically,
tragically, the two of you

00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:15.370
meet each other and
discover that you're both

00:45:15.370 --> 00:45:16.820
researching the same plant.

00:45:16.820 --> 00:45:21.040
And you look at your
numbers, and your heart

00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:22.400
breaks at that point.

00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:25.790
Because you look at these,
and what's going on here?

00:45:25.790 --> 00:45:26.760
What's going on?

00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:29.220
Let's translate this
notion of heritability,

00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:30.510
and variance, and all of that.

00:45:30.510 --> 00:45:33.870
Let's translate it into
a very simple question

00:45:33.870 --> 00:45:37.360
you can ask, translating
all of this in English.

00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:43.520
You're interested in what this
gene has to do with plant IQ.

00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:46.970
And you're allowed to find
out one piece of information.

00:45:46.970 --> 00:45:52.280
You could know whether the
plant has version A, B, or C,

00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:55.320
or you could know
whether the plant is

00:45:55.320 --> 00:45:58.250
growing in the Amazon
or the Gobi Desert.

00:45:58.250 --> 00:46:01.290
Which piece of information
is going to give you

00:46:01.290 --> 00:46:03.890
more predictive power?

00:46:03.890 --> 00:46:07.490
And what you wind up seeing
here is if you can either

00:46:07.490 --> 00:46:10.240
know this or the
environment, you

00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:12.200
want to know what
the environment is.

00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:19.050
The variability-- plant IQ could
come in at 98, 100, 102, eight,

00:46:19.050 --> 00:46:21.340
10, and 12.

00:46:21.340 --> 00:46:25.020
Far more of the variability
in those six numbers

00:46:25.020 --> 00:46:27.420
is explained by what
environment it's

00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:31.430
going on in rather than
the genetic difference.

00:46:31.430 --> 00:46:34.030
That's what heritability
is telling you.

00:46:34.030 --> 00:46:36.680
And in a study like
this, it would tell you

00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:40.420
that the heritability number
is actually quite low.

00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:45.120
Because the amount of variation
due to this is far less

00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:48.590
explained by the gene
type than whether it's

00:46:48.590 --> 00:46:51.700
the Amazon or the Gobi Desert.

00:46:51.700 --> 00:46:53.710
So that's a first pass at it.

00:46:53.710 --> 00:46:55.940
Why is this really important?

00:46:55.940 --> 00:46:57.810
For the following reason.

00:46:57.810 --> 00:47:00.460
You're a scientist,
and you are trying

00:47:00.460 --> 00:47:05.380
to understand how A, B,
and C influence plant IQ.

00:47:05.380 --> 00:47:07.740
And you come up with
something nutty and stupid

00:47:07.740 --> 00:47:09.690
like saying, Well,
I would like to be

00:47:09.690 --> 00:47:13.750
able to do field seasons in both
the Amazon and the Gobi Desert.

00:47:13.750 --> 00:47:16.830
And your advisor will
say, or all of your elders

00:47:16.830 --> 00:47:19.630
will say something like,
No, you can't do that.

00:47:19.630 --> 00:47:24.450
Because that's just-- you're
not controlling for environment.

00:47:24.450 --> 00:47:29.300
You're not studying it in only
one controlled environment.

00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:31.550
You can't go to-- they're
such different ecosystems,

00:47:31.550 --> 00:47:32.230
all of that.

00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:34.970
Pick one and go study it there.

00:47:34.970 --> 00:47:37.140
And what you do is
you go study it there.

00:47:37.140 --> 00:47:39.010
And as a result of
just studying it here,

00:47:39.010 --> 00:47:41.800
you come away thinking
that virtually

00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:45.260
all of the variability
is explained by genes.

00:47:45.260 --> 00:47:47.540
What have you just done?

00:47:47.540 --> 00:47:51.100
You explicitly have
designed your experiment

00:47:51.100 --> 00:47:54.910
so that you can't detect
the environmental role

00:47:54.910 --> 00:47:56.820
in determining that trait.

00:47:56.820 --> 00:48:01.170
What counts as setting up the
experiment as the right way

00:48:01.170 --> 00:48:03.180
for people who think
about this sort of thing,

00:48:03.180 --> 00:48:05.450
standard sort of
approaches to experiment,

00:48:05.450 --> 00:48:10.640
what counts as doing a good
job by definition, what you're

00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:14.530
doing is biasing towards
thinking the genetic input

00:48:14.530 --> 00:48:17.370
is more important
than it actually is.

00:48:17.370 --> 00:48:20.660
Because scientists don't
decide to study this trait

00:48:20.660 --> 00:48:21.700
in two different places.

00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:23.800
You don't decide
to do a study where

00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:27.570
you're looking at some trait
in both rats and ocelots,

00:48:27.570 --> 00:48:28.140
or something.

00:48:31.020 --> 00:48:32.930
Look, pick one species.

00:48:32.930 --> 00:48:34.990
Maybe even pick just one gender.

00:48:34.990 --> 00:48:36.290
Pick one environment.

00:48:36.290 --> 00:48:38.980
Don't have your rats in one room
where the air conditioning is

00:48:38.980 --> 00:48:42.480
going nonstop and the other
room you're barbecuing stuff.

00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:45.370
Control for environment.

00:48:45.370 --> 00:48:46.870
And by definition,
if you've done

00:48:46.870 --> 00:48:49.172
the nice, careful,
responsible thing

00:48:49.172 --> 00:48:51.630
that a scientist's supposed to
do doing this sort of thing,

00:48:51.630 --> 00:48:53.300
you control for environment.

00:48:53.300 --> 00:48:55.250
What have you just done?

00:48:55.250 --> 00:48:57.270
You have just
removed your ability

00:48:57.270 --> 00:48:59.720
to see the role of environment.

00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:03.010
And you have just artificially
inflated how important

00:49:03.010 --> 00:49:04.690
you think the genes are.

00:49:04.690 --> 00:49:06.410
OK, let's take a
five minute break.

00:49:06.410 --> 00:49:08.580
We are going to look at
this in a lot more detail.

00:49:08.580 --> 00:49:11.450
Do not freak out if this is
not immediately intuitively

00:49:11.450 --> 00:49:13.010
obvious.

00:49:13.010 --> 00:49:14.940
Questions that just came up.

00:49:14.940 --> 00:49:16.740
The first one is
pointing out one

00:49:16.740 --> 00:49:19.840
of those where I probably
should have actually taught

00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:21.340
something clearer.

00:49:21.340 --> 00:49:25.460
What are you talking about with
proteins being different sizes?

00:49:25.460 --> 00:49:27.880
How do you figure out
proteins are different sizes?

00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:29.920
And the answer is
you make them stand

00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:31.940
against the wall in their
bedroom with a ruler,

00:49:31.940 --> 00:49:33.080
and you mark it there.

00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:35.080
And then you see if
they differ in size.

00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:37.940
Or if that doesn't
work, what you do is you

00:49:37.940 --> 00:49:40.560
use various
biochemical techniques.

00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:44.850
You basically make
something akin

00:49:44.850 --> 00:49:48.810
to a thick, homogeneous
soup of something or other.

00:49:48.810 --> 00:49:51.800
And you put the two different
versions of the protein

00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:54.540
in there, and essentially
you sit and wait

00:49:54.540 --> 00:49:57.980
and see how far they sink down.

00:49:57.980 --> 00:50:01.730
And the one that's heavier is
going to sink down further.

00:50:01.730 --> 00:50:05.090
Anyone who knowns about gels
and the electrophoresis,

00:50:05.090 --> 00:50:06.650
that's insanely simplified.

00:50:06.650 --> 00:50:09.020
But that's basically
the notion of it.

00:50:09.020 --> 00:50:10.840
Put them where they
move through something

00:50:10.840 --> 00:50:13.130
as a function of
their weight, gravity,

00:50:13.130 --> 00:50:15.750
and you could then pick
up size differences.

00:50:15.750 --> 00:50:17.410
The other good
question that was asked

00:50:17.410 --> 00:50:20.810
is, What did you just say
in the last 10 minutes?

00:50:20.810 --> 00:50:25.430
This is very difficult. This
is an extremely subtle point.

00:50:25.430 --> 00:50:27.370
And I'm going to hammer
it in over, and over,

00:50:27.370 --> 00:50:29.720
again here, in
sections, all of that.

00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:31.330
Why is it so important?

00:50:31.330 --> 00:50:35.000
Because number one, this
is a number, heritability,

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:37.890
that the general lay
public comes away

00:50:37.890 --> 00:50:40.550
with interpreting
incompletely wrongly.

00:50:40.550 --> 00:50:43.690
And number two, the vast
majority of scientists,

00:50:43.690 --> 00:50:46.500
when they're working in this
field of behavior genetics,

00:50:46.500 --> 00:50:50.390
design their experiments
so that by definition, they

00:50:50.390 --> 00:50:52.780
are eliminating
all sorts of realms

00:50:52.780 --> 00:50:55.710
of environmental influences.

00:50:55.710 --> 00:50:57.440
So going back to this here.

00:50:57.440 --> 00:51:00.620
So here we see once again
this simple question.

00:51:00.620 --> 00:51:04.090
Use this one over and over
translating all this theory

00:51:04.090 --> 00:51:05.750
in variation and stuff.

00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:08.410
Always translates into
the same question.

00:51:08.410 --> 00:51:12.040
I can find out what type,
what version of this gene,

00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:15.580
or I can find out which
environment this is happening.

00:51:15.580 --> 00:51:18.830
Which one do I want to know if I
want to be in a better position

00:51:18.830 --> 00:51:20.420
to guess what's going on?

00:51:20.420 --> 00:51:23.700
And when it looks like this, you
don't want to know the genes.

00:51:23.700 --> 00:51:27.650
You want to know the environment
because it's far more powerful.

00:51:27.650 --> 00:51:30.550
And if you only studied
this in this setting,

00:51:30.550 --> 00:51:34.130
you would come away saying,
Oh, this variability

00:51:34.130 --> 00:51:38.110
is entirely explained by
which version of the gene.

00:51:38.110 --> 00:51:43.670
Oh, this trait, plant IQ,
has 100% heritability.

00:51:43.670 --> 00:51:47.260
And what you see there is
when you combine it together

00:51:47.260 --> 00:51:51.210
with numbers like these,
it's 15% heritability.

00:51:51.210 --> 00:51:55.520
So that's totally
critical to hammer in.

00:51:55.520 --> 00:51:58.110
So what are some of the
responses at that point

00:51:58.110 --> 00:52:00.070
by people who will
say, That's ridiculous.

00:52:00.070 --> 00:52:02.720
If you're saying what
heritability mostly

00:52:02.720 --> 00:52:06.540
should be teaching us is
how unpowerful genes are,

00:52:06.540 --> 00:52:08.970
what would be one of
the initial responses?

00:52:08.970 --> 00:52:09.570
Great.

00:52:09.570 --> 00:52:12.800
How many plants out there are
growing in both the Amazon

00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:14.050
and the Gobi Desert.

00:52:14.050 --> 00:52:16.400
And it's so hard to
study IQ in plants.

00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:20.590
This is a totally artificial
dichotomy between the extremes

00:52:20.590 --> 00:52:22.540
of environment.

00:52:22.540 --> 00:52:24.350
You're like
inflating things now.

00:52:24.350 --> 00:52:26.330
You're cheating in
the other direction

00:52:26.330 --> 00:52:29.770
to get the most dramatic
artificial circumstances

00:52:29.770 --> 00:52:33.340
to inflate your sense of how
important environment is.

00:52:33.340 --> 00:52:36.620
This is totally
artificially dichotomized.

00:52:36.620 --> 00:52:40.820
So think about humans, and think
about one single fact, which

00:52:40.820 --> 00:52:44.060
is we inhabit more
different environments

00:52:44.060 --> 00:52:46.020
than any other species on Earth.

00:52:46.020 --> 00:52:49.400
We live in the Amazon, and
we live in the Gobi Desert.

00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:54.190
And we live in Peoria, and
we live in all these things.

00:52:54.190 --> 00:52:58.110
And we have more exposure
to different sorts

00:52:58.110 --> 00:52:59.310
of environments.

00:52:59.310 --> 00:53:02.640
So immediately, that
argument goes down the drain.

00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:03.390
OK.

00:53:03.390 --> 00:53:06.600
So now instead, somebody
argues something different,

00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:12.480
saying OK, sometimes plants
have IQ in the Amazon

00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:13.530
and in the Gobi Desert.

00:53:13.530 --> 00:53:16.110
And I get your point,
your stupid point here

00:53:16.110 --> 00:53:18.331
that ooh, environment
can make-- No one's going

00:53:18.331 --> 00:53:20.830
to argue that the difference
between the Amazon and the Gobi

00:53:20.830 --> 00:53:22.330
Desert isn't important.

00:53:22.330 --> 00:53:23.180
Oh, yeah, OK.

00:53:23.180 --> 00:53:25.974
Well, humans, they live
in both, all of that.

00:53:25.974 --> 00:53:27.390
It's not an
artificial difference.

00:53:27.390 --> 00:53:29.130
But you notice something?

00:53:29.130 --> 00:53:31.620
Isn't it interesting
that in these two

00:53:31.620 --> 00:53:37.070
different environments, C plants
always have the highest IQ,

00:53:37.070 --> 00:53:39.830
and A plants always
have the lowest.

00:53:39.830 --> 00:53:42.450
That's telling us
something about that gene.

00:53:42.450 --> 00:53:46.550
That's telling us, and you're
then saying well, yes, yes, it

00:53:46.550 --> 00:53:47.760
differs by environment.

00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:51.360
But we've just learned something
very important about these gene

00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:51.950
versions.

00:53:51.950 --> 00:53:54.590
Which is, in totally
different environments,

00:53:54.590 --> 00:53:57.280
version C gives you
a higher plant IQ.

00:53:57.280 --> 00:53:58.820
So that's important.

00:53:58.820 --> 00:53:59.940
Yeah, yeah, environment.

00:53:59.940 --> 00:54:02.840
But we've just seen how
powerful this gene is.

00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:05.840
But then you run into the
person at the conference who

00:54:05.840 --> 00:54:07.360
is studying it in
the Gobi desert,

00:54:07.360 --> 00:54:09.240
and they put their
data up and it's

00:54:09.240 --> 00:54:12.650
even worse than in
the last version

00:54:12.650 --> 00:54:15.160
because it looks like this.

00:54:15.160 --> 00:54:17.590
And what have you just learned?

00:54:17.590 --> 00:54:20.560
That you can't say a
thing about this gene.

00:54:20.560 --> 00:54:23.639
You have just learned the
translation of this sentence.

00:54:23.639 --> 00:54:25.180
The first critical
sentence we've had

00:54:25.180 --> 00:54:26.820
over and over is,
if you can only

00:54:26.820 --> 00:54:28.704
know one factoid,
one about which gene

00:54:28.704 --> 00:54:30.870
version or what environment,
choose the environment,

00:54:30.870 --> 00:54:33.940
we have now just learned
a second sentence.

00:54:33.940 --> 00:54:35.630
A second question to ask.

00:54:35.630 --> 00:54:43.480
Which is, what does having A, B,
or C have to do with plant IQ?

00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:48.450
And if the answer
is "it depends,"

00:54:48.450 --> 00:54:50.320
you've just seen this subtlety.

00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:54.290
If the answer is, "it
depends on which environment

00:54:54.290 --> 00:54:57.520
you're looking at." if
you're looking in the Amazon,

00:54:57.520 --> 00:55:00.180
C gets you the best plant IQ.

00:55:00.180 --> 00:55:02.150
if you're looking
in the Gobi desert,

00:55:02.150 --> 00:55:04.890
C gets you the worst plant IQ.

00:55:04.890 --> 00:55:06.730
What have you just shown?

00:55:06.730 --> 00:55:10.260
What is technically the
definition of a gene

00:55:10.260 --> 00:55:12.830
environment interaction?

00:55:12.830 --> 00:55:15.590
And we've just seen going
from, well yeah, yeah,

00:55:15.590 --> 00:55:17.990
they're very different,
but C is always the best.

00:55:17.990 --> 00:55:19.000
Isn't that interesting?

00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:21.310
To a completely
different profile.

00:55:21.310 --> 00:55:25.200
What does A, B, or C
have to do with plant IQ?

00:55:25.200 --> 00:55:26.320
It depends.

00:55:26.320 --> 00:55:28.230
It depends on the environment.

00:55:28.230 --> 00:55:32.230
That's how you've just
defined, that's your diagnosis,

00:55:32.230 --> 00:55:34.500
for gene environment
interaction.

00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:36.800
And what ultimately
one has to argue

00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:41.140
is that it is impossible to
ever say what a gene does.

00:55:41.140 --> 00:55:44.980
You can only say what a gene
does in the environments which

00:55:44.980 --> 00:55:47.930
to date it has been studied in.

00:55:47.930 --> 00:55:51.100
OK, let's see that
expanding even more.

00:55:51.100 --> 00:55:55.400
Because you've got this--
OK, let's jump ahead.

00:55:55.400 --> 00:55:59.590
OK, so this is showing you
now just how totally nutty

00:55:59.590 --> 00:56:02.940
and counter-intuitive
heritability terms actually

00:56:02.940 --> 00:56:04.090
are.

00:56:04.090 --> 00:56:05.410
You ask a question.

00:56:05.410 --> 00:56:11.436
What's the heritability of
number of fingers on your hand?

00:56:11.436 --> 00:56:13.280
You know, genes have
to do with the fact

00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:15.690
that we've got five fingers
instead of flippers,

00:56:15.690 --> 00:56:16.940
or some such thing.

00:56:16.940 --> 00:56:19.110
Genes have huge
amounts to do with it.

00:56:19.110 --> 00:56:22.510
You're not asking about the
average number of fingers,

00:56:22.510 --> 00:56:24.750
you're asking about
the variability.

00:56:24.750 --> 00:56:26.220
Remember that again.

00:56:26.220 --> 00:56:28.680
So what are the
circumstances out there

00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:32.380
which will give somebody
six fingers instead of five?

00:56:32.380 --> 00:56:33.970
That's incredibly rare.

00:56:33.970 --> 00:56:36.240
What about four fingers
instead of five?

00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:38.240
Oh, industrial accidents.

00:56:38.240 --> 00:56:40.010
Three fingers instead of five?

00:56:40.010 --> 00:56:42.240
Lots of industrial accidents.

00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:43.160
Two?

00:56:43.160 --> 00:56:44.670
Change jobs or whatever.

00:56:44.670 --> 00:56:47.550
What are we seeing
here in terms of,

00:56:47.550 --> 00:56:51.360
how much do genes have
to do with having fewer

00:56:51.360 --> 00:56:52.890
than five fingers?

00:56:52.890 --> 00:56:55.300
It's all industrial accidents.

00:56:55.300 --> 00:56:57.400
Genes have nothing
to do with it.

00:56:57.400 --> 00:57:00.270
There's no doubt some
weirdo disease out there.

00:57:00.270 --> 00:57:02.850
But for our purposes,
this is how it works.

00:57:02.850 --> 00:57:05.250
What have we just discovered?

00:57:05.250 --> 00:57:12.150
Number of fingers, that
trait has a 0% heritability.

00:57:12.150 --> 00:57:13.490
That's totally bizarre.

00:57:13.490 --> 00:57:15.940
That's completely
counter-intuitive.

00:57:15.940 --> 00:57:19.160
Genes have everything to do
with why the average human has

00:57:19.160 --> 00:57:21.130
five fingers, but
they have nothing

00:57:21.130 --> 00:57:23.840
to do with the variability.

00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:26.860
In that case, it's
entirely environmental.

00:57:26.860 --> 00:57:31.880
The number of fingers you
have has 0% heritability.

00:57:31.880 --> 00:57:34.250
Now let's look at
another example.

00:57:34.250 --> 00:57:37.690
It's 1950 in Eisenhower America.

00:57:37.690 --> 00:57:39.750
Actually, it wasn't until 1952.

00:57:39.750 --> 00:57:43.380
But it's a very
different world than now.

00:57:43.380 --> 00:57:46.180
And one of the things that you
would never ever, ever, never,

00:57:46.180 --> 00:57:48.730
never, ever see in
the United States

00:57:48.730 --> 00:57:51.660
would be some guy
wearing an earring.

00:57:51.660 --> 00:57:54.350
Unless in a very cloistered
part of the country

00:57:54.350 --> 00:57:55.990
he was a sensitive guy.

00:57:55.990 --> 00:58:00.250
But for most of America,
this is not what men do.

00:58:00.250 --> 00:58:01.590
They do not wear earrings.

00:58:01.590 --> 00:58:03.240
And likewise, in
most of America,

00:58:03.240 --> 00:58:05.940
if you were a good
red-blooded American woman,

00:58:05.940 --> 00:58:09.170
you would not go outside
without your earrings on.

00:58:09.170 --> 00:58:13.590
So now you've got
to say OK, well

00:58:13.590 --> 00:58:20.520
what causes variability in
earring wearing behavior?

00:58:20.520 --> 00:58:24.480
And it's entirely explained by
whether you are female or male,

00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:26.760
which is a genetic trait.

00:58:26.760 --> 00:58:29.660
What we've just seen
is, whether or not

00:58:29.660 --> 00:58:36.180
you wear earrings in 1952
has 100% heritability.

00:58:36.180 --> 00:58:38.010
Totally counter-intuitive.

00:58:38.010 --> 00:58:40.400
Think through this again
and again and again,

00:58:40.400 --> 00:58:41.880
because this makes sense.

00:58:41.880 --> 00:58:46.380
When heritability is a number
about this rather than this,

00:58:46.380 --> 00:58:49.490
you get a world
where 0% heritability

00:58:49.490 --> 00:58:51.890
for your number of
fingers and 100%

00:58:51.890 --> 00:58:55.970
heritability for whether you are
wearing earrings at that time.

00:58:55.970 --> 00:58:59.710
Because once again,
asking OK, I've

00:58:59.710 --> 00:59:01.090
got a choice in the matter.

00:59:01.090 --> 00:59:04.800
I can either know the entire
genome of this individual,

00:59:04.800 --> 00:59:08.220
or I can know whether
they are in a frat where

00:59:08.220 --> 00:59:11.130
they close their eyes and
work with a wood saw every now

00:59:11.130 --> 00:59:11.700
and then.

00:59:11.700 --> 00:59:13.800
Which fact do I want to know?

00:59:13.800 --> 00:59:16.470
That's the one that will tell
me what about the environment

00:59:16.470 --> 00:59:17.490
going on with them.

00:59:17.490 --> 00:59:19.310
Or now you have a choice.

00:59:19.310 --> 00:59:21.860
I can either know the entire
genome of this person,

00:59:21.860 --> 00:59:26.490
or I can know that what
sort of environment

00:59:26.490 --> 00:59:28.320
they're living in 1952.

00:59:28.320 --> 00:59:31.200
What do you want to know
there is, male or female.

00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:34.740
If I know that, I can
completely predict this behavior

00:59:34.740 --> 00:59:36.560
of earring wearing.

00:59:36.560 --> 00:59:39.620
So this totally
counter-intuitive thing here,

00:59:39.620 --> 00:59:43.010
where heritability is telling
just the opposite of what

00:59:43.010 --> 00:59:44.690
people intuitively think.

00:59:44.690 --> 00:59:46.720
And as soon as
you deal with that

00:59:46.720 --> 00:59:50.190
and recognize that and
recognize the way scientists do

00:59:50.190 --> 00:59:52.380
experiments, is to
try to do things

00:59:52.380 --> 00:59:56.520
as cleanly as possible--
study it only in one place,

00:59:56.520 --> 00:59:59.860
in only one setting, only one
circumstance-- you have just

00:59:59.860 --> 01:00:02.220
artificially
guaranteed that you're

01:00:02.220 --> 01:00:04.220
going to come away more
impressed with the genes

01:00:04.220 --> 01:00:06.810
than they actually
deserve to be.

01:00:06.810 --> 01:00:07.840
So how would this look?

01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:11.700
Beginning now in more detail.

01:00:11.700 --> 01:00:15.210
So what we've got here are
a number of different ways

01:00:15.210 --> 01:00:18.290
in which you can see when
are genes important, when

01:00:18.290 --> 01:00:20.500
are environment important,
that sort of thing.

01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:23.990
OK, so we have here two
different traits-- no,

01:00:23.990 --> 01:00:27.250
we have one trait, two
different flavors of a gene.

01:00:27.250 --> 01:00:32.500
Flavors A and B. And three
different environments.

01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:36.360
So here you have the
Amazon, the Gobi Desert,

01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:37.680
and a roller coaster.

01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:39.292
And you're measuring plant IQ.

01:00:39.292 --> 01:00:41.500
And there's two different
versions of the gene there.

01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:43.520
And you're asking
well, what does

01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:45.830
gene, what to environment
have to do with it?

01:00:45.830 --> 01:00:47.230
Your data look like this.

01:00:47.230 --> 01:00:48.480
What does it tell you?

01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:51.080
Environment makes no
difference at all.

01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:53.720
It doesn't matter if you are
in the desert, the rainforest,

01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:54.410
whatever.

01:00:54.410 --> 01:00:57.700
Which version of the
gene you have entirely

01:00:57.700 --> 01:01:00.650
explains variability.

01:01:00.650 --> 01:01:05.950
So this is what a heritability
of like 100% would look like.

01:01:05.950 --> 01:01:08.220
Now you do the study,
and instead you

01:01:08.220 --> 01:01:11.030
get data like these.

01:01:11.030 --> 01:01:13.450
You'll note just one of
the most important things

01:01:13.450 --> 01:01:15.490
about being a card
carrying scientist, which

01:01:15.490 --> 01:01:17.600
is data are plural.

01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:19.480
Which, talk about
counter-intuitive,

01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:22.140
earrings are genetic
and data are plural.

01:01:22.140 --> 01:01:26.450
So now you get these data
and you see as follows.

01:01:26.450 --> 01:01:28.921
In this environment,
no difference depending

01:01:28.921 --> 01:01:30.170
on what type of gene you have.

01:01:30.170 --> 01:01:32.260
In this environment, no
difference, no difference.

01:01:32.260 --> 01:01:35.360
In each environment,
very different averages.

01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:40.350
Ah, this is what it would look
like with 0% heritability.

01:01:40.350 --> 01:01:43.970
There is no difference at all
of the variation explained

01:01:43.970 --> 01:01:45.360
by gene variation.

01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:48.610
It's all environmental.

01:01:48.610 --> 01:01:51.420
So now we have a
version that forces

01:01:51.420 --> 01:01:54.370
us to put in the same phrase
we heard about before.

01:01:54.370 --> 01:01:57.550
This is what your
data look like now.

01:01:57.550 --> 01:02:01.240
And you now ask
the question, well,

01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:05.200
what does being in environment--
what does your environment have

01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:07.050
to do with your plant IQ?

01:02:07.050 --> 01:02:11.770
And the answer is, it depends
on which version of the gene

01:02:11.770 --> 01:02:13.230
you have.

01:02:13.230 --> 01:02:15.180
And now you ask,
what does having

01:02:15.180 --> 01:02:18.700
a certain version of the gene
have to do with your plant IQ?

01:02:18.700 --> 01:02:23.220
And the answer is, it depends
on which environment you're in.

01:02:23.220 --> 01:02:27.760
This is, in a sense, the verbal
definition, again, of a gene

01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:29.720
environment interaction.

01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:32.290
What do genes have to
do with this trait?

01:02:32.290 --> 01:02:33.416
Depends on the environment.

01:02:33.416 --> 01:02:35.331
What does environment
have to do with a trait?

01:02:35.331 --> 01:02:36.710
It depends on the type of genes.

01:02:36.710 --> 01:02:38.850
This is what the
data would look like.

01:02:38.850 --> 01:02:41.134
And here you have
an interaction.

01:02:41.134 --> 01:02:44.110
And in some fudging
of the numbers,

01:02:44.110 --> 01:02:47.490
this is what 50%
heritability would look like.

01:02:47.490 --> 01:02:51.410
What we just saw here before,
our hypothetical example

01:02:51.410 --> 01:02:53.910
of the messiest
it could get, this

01:02:53.910 --> 01:02:56.470
is the one where the people come
back and say, yes, yes, yes,

01:02:56.470 --> 01:02:57.370
environment matters.

01:02:57.370 --> 01:02:59.820
But you notice
version C is always

01:02:59.820 --> 01:03:01.680
associated with the highest IQ.

01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:03.490
And here we have
the version where

01:03:03.490 --> 01:03:06.150
depending on the setting, if
you have this type of gene,

01:03:06.150 --> 01:03:07.210
it gets better.

01:03:07.210 --> 01:03:09.850
If you have this type
of gene, it gets worse.

01:03:09.850 --> 01:03:12.930
This is one where there's
a dramatic interaction

01:03:12.930 --> 01:03:15.700
between what the genes
are doing and what

01:03:15.700 --> 01:03:17.090
the environment is doing.

01:03:17.090 --> 01:03:19.940
This is one that's going to
have an even lower heritability

01:03:19.940 --> 01:03:24.210
because this is one where
you are saying big time,

01:03:24.210 --> 01:03:25.200
it depends.

01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:26.750
It depends on what
the gene type is.

01:03:26.750 --> 01:03:27.470
It depends.

01:03:27.470 --> 01:03:29.170
It depends on what
the environment is.

01:03:29.170 --> 01:03:30.870
This is, in a sense,
as dramatically

01:03:30.870 --> 01:03:32.730
as it could be that case.

01:03:32.730 --> 01:03:36.390
So you constantly have
stuff like this going on.

01:03:36.390 --> 01:03:39.420
Let's look at an example
where, in fact, you wind up

01:03:39.420 --> 01:03:41.070
seeing something like this.

01:03:41.070 --> 01:03:46.140
Back to our iconic mutation
disease from the other day

01:03:46.140 --> 01:03:47.430
there, PKU.

01:03:47.430 --> 01:03:48.690
Phenylketonuria.

01:03:48.690 --> 01:03:51.430
Just to remind you, do not
worry about the details.

01:03:51.430 --> 01:03:55.870
It's this disease where normally
there's this thing in your body

01:03:55.870 --> 01:03:57.720
which would be
toxic to your brain

01:03:57.720 --> 01:04:01.060
unless it's turned
into something else.

01:04:01.060 --> 01:04:04.540
And this is the
enzyme-- the protein,

01:04:04.540 --> 01:04:06.310
and thus coded for
by a gene-- this

01:04:06.310 --> 01:04:08.540
is the enzyme that
turns the scary version

01:04:08.540 --> 01:04:09.720
into the safe version.

01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:13.100
And in PKU, you have a
mutation in this enzyme,

01:04:13.100 --> 01:04:14.520
it's not doing its job.

01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:18.950
The scary version builds up and
wipes out your nervous system.

01:04:18.950 --> 01:04:20.300
That looks bad.

01:04:20.300 --> 01:04:23.440
And what we've got now
is a trait where you're

01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:26.490
going to say, well, let's see.

01:04:26.490 --> 01:04:29.640
I am very interested
in knowing, being

01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:33.060
able to predict whether or not
this person has a fairly normal

01:04:33.060 --> 01:04:35.640
looking brain or whether
it looks like Swiss cheese.

01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:38.010
Do I want to know whether
or not they're growing up

01:04:38.010 --> 01:04:40.649
in Idaho versus Montana?

01:04:40.649 --> 01:04:42.440
Or do I want to know
whether or not they've

01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:44.697
got a mutation in this enzyme?

01:04:44.697 --> 01:04:46.280
Obviously, you want
to know if there's

01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:47.600
a mutation in the enzyme.

01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:50.740
Seemingly, heritability is 100%.

01:04:50.740 --> 01:04:52.890
But now you do
something which people

01:04:52.890 --> 01:04:55.960
have been doing for people with
PKU for a couple of decades

01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:56.460
now.

01:04:56.460 --> 01:05:01.390
Which is, you put little labels
on bottles of food and stuff

01:05:01.390 --> 01:05:06.580
saying, if this food contains
the scary bad news thing.

01:05:06.580 --> 01:05:09.640
And if you have
PKU, if you simply

01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:13.910
don't eat food that contains
that-- if you have what's

01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:16.840
called a fennel
alanine free diet--

01:05:16.840 --> 01:05:19.960
you don't get your brain
looking like Swiss cheese.

01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:21.320
What have you got there?

01:05:21.320 --> 01:05:24.220
You've just put in an
environmental influence

01:05:24.220 --> 01:05:27.720
that has reduced
heritability down to zero.

01:05:27.720 --> 01:05:31.520
This is a case where we've got
something like this looking.

01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:34.850
And here we're measuring is,
like, the Swiss cheese index,

01:05:34.850 --> 01:05:36.210
or whatever of the brain.

01:05:36.210 --> 01:05:40.350
And what we've got here is, this
is an environment where people

01:05:40.350 --> 01:05:44.190
know how much of the stuff there
is in different types of food

01:05:44.190 --> 01:05:45.440
and don't eat it.

01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:47.960
A simple environmental--
not so simple--

01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:50.050
but an environmental
intervention.

01:05:50.050 --> 01:05:52.900
A behavioral change
in the environment.

01:05:52.900 --> 01:05:56.760
And you've just reduced
heritability from 100% to 0%.

01:05:56.760 --> 01:05:59.160
So that is a dramatic version.

01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:04.010
Now, let's look at a version
of a real life example of this.

01:06:04.010 --> 01:06:08.960
This would be with-- I think
I've already put this one up.

01:06:21.194 --> 01:06:24.630
OK, does this work
familiar by now?

01:06:24.630 --> 01:06:25.500
No.

01:06:25.500 --> 01:06:26.950
OK, that was at Thanksgiving.

01:06:26.950 --> 01:06:27.450
OK.

01:06:27.450 --> 01:06:31.200
What we've got here is a
gene that's got something

01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:32.220
to do with depression.

01:06:32.220 --> 01:06:34.670
It's a gene that has something
to do with neurotransmitter

01:06:34.670 --> 01:06:35.800
serotonin.

01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:38.010
Details don't matter,
they will come later.

01:06:38.010 --> 01:06:40.780
But the gene comes in
two different flavors.

01:06:40.780 --> 01:06:43.510
And one version of it,
based on everything

01:06:43.510 --> 01:06:45.700
that's known from
laboratory animals,

01:06:45.700 --> 01:06:48.810
one version should be
the kind that predisposes

01:06:48.810 --> 01:06:51.240
you more towards depression.

01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:54.680
So, in this incredibly
important study

01:06:54.680 --> 01:06:56.390
that was done a
number of years ago,

01:06:56.390 --> 01:06:59.190
a guy named Caspi, Duke
University, and colleagues,

01:06:59.190 --> 01:07:04.000
they had been studying 17,000
people basically from birth

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.670
up to age 25 or
so in New Zealand.

01:07:06.670 --> 01:07:08.200
And who knows why
in New Zealand,

01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:11.310
but studying them there,
and following and asking.

01:07:11.310 --> 01:07:14.180
They took blood so they know
the whole genetic profiles.

01:07:14.180 --> 01:07:17.330
And looking at, among
other things, by age 25,

01:07:17.330 --> 01:07:19.540
does the person have
major depression or not.

01:07:19.540 --> 01:07:22.370
Have they had an
episode of depression.

01:07:22.370 --> 01:07:26.420
And now let's go look at which
version of this gene they have.

01:07:26.420 --> 01:07:28.640
And what would everything
predict from all the animal

01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:31.770
studies, which is you have
the bad version of the gene

01:07:31.770 --> 01:07:34.930
and you're, as a human,
going to have a higher

01:07:34.930 --> 01:07:37.320
chance of having a depression.

01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:39.340
That's not what the
data looked like.

01:07:39.340 --> 01:07:43.170
Instead, it was one
of those "it depends."

01:07:43.170 --> 01:07:46.090
It depends on the environment.

01:07:46.090 --> 01:07:48.510
What you saw was,
it all depended

01:07:48.510 --> 01:07:54.220
on how many major childhood
stressors there were.

01:07:54.220 --> 01:07:57.680
Loss of a parent, divorce,
abuse, some such thing.

01:07:57.680 --> 01:08:00.700
And the absence of
any of those, this

01:08:00.700 --> 01:08:02.670
was the rate of depression
in the people having

01:08:02.670 --> 01:08:03.980
the good version.

01:08:03.980 --> 01:08:06.820
And throw in one childhood
trauma, two of them,

01:08:06.820 --> 01:08:10.690
three of them, and the
incidence is going up slightly.

01:08:10.690 --> 01:08:13.540
Now, you've got the bad
version of the gene.

01:08:13.540 --> 01:08:16.630
And it puts you
more at risk only

01:08:16.630 --> 01:08:19.010
in certain types
of environments.

01:08:19.010 --> 01:08:22.330
So here we have a great gene
environment interaction.

01:08:22.330 --> 01:08:24.130
That's something
straight out of this one.

01:08:24.130 --> 01:08:25.935
You're saying well,
what does this gene

01:08:25.935 --> 01:08:27.560
have to do with the
risk of depression?

01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:29.510
And the answer is, it depends.

01:08:29.510 --> 01:08:32.710
It depends on what your
childhood environment was like.

01:08:32.710 --> 01:08:35.779
But now, one additional detail
showing that this is actually

01:08:35.779 --> 01:08:36.810
a case of this.

01:08:36.810 --> 01:08:38.830
One that just gets
ignored whenever

01:08:38.830 --> 01:08:41.620
people talk about the
study because it's cool,

01:08:41.620 --> 01:08:43.542
but it's actually not
all that important.

01:08:43.542 --> 01:08:46.000
OK, so here's the people with
the good version of the gene,

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:47.292
but it makes this point though.

01:08:47.292 --> 01:08:49.416
You've got the good version,
and they're down here.

01:08:49.416 --> 01:08:50.920
And you know what's
going to happen,

01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:52.919
the bad version is going
to be exactly the same.

01:08:52.919 --> 01:08:57.800
But you look at the data
closely, and in the absence,

01:08:57.800 --> 01:09:01.370
the bad version is actually
a little bit protective

01:09:01.370 --> 01:09:04.290
from depression versus
the quote "good version."

01:09:04.290 --> 01:09:06.140
What have you just
discovered there?

01:09:06.140 --> 01:09:07.859
It's one of these.

01:09:07.859 --> 01:09:10.840
This is a radical gene
environment interaction.

01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:14.797
Not only is it the case that,
does this put you more at risk?

01:09:14.797 --> 01:09:16.380
Well, that depends
on the environment.

01:09:16.380 --> 01:09:19.591
Depending on your environment,
it could put you less at risk.

01:09:19.591 --> 01:09:21.340
This one is not a big
deal because there's

01:09:21.340 --> 01:09:22.914
a tiny difference.

01:09:22.914 --> 01:09:24.330
There's no reason
to pay attention

01:09:24.330 --> 01:09:27.580
to it, other than just sort of
pointing it out pedagogically.

01:09:27.580 --> 01:09:31.149
But this is an amazing
example where this can

01:09:31.149 --> 01:09:33.140
go in the opposite direction.

01:09:33.140 --> 01:09:37.560
This is a hugely important
gene environment interaction.

01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:40.930
So what all of this begins
to set you up for is,

01:09:40.930 --> 01:09:43.800
you've forgot this
heritability number.

01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:46.350
And people come away
constantly thinking about,

01:09:46.350 --> 01:09:49.859
it's telling you about how much
the average level of a trait

01:09:49.859 --> 01:09:51.250
is determined by genes.

01:09:51.250 --> 01:09:54.109
It's instead telling you
how much the variability.

01:09:54.109 --> 01:09:57.320
What that means, thus, by
definition, that there's

01:09:57.320 --> 01:10:00.260
all sorts of nutty
counter-intuitive things going

01:10:00.260 --> 01:10:03.610
on, where earrings are totally
heritable and number of fingers

01:10:03.610 --> 01:10:04.485
are not.

01:10:04.485 --> 01:10:09.070
What that tells you is, by
definition, the way experiments

01:10:09.070 --> 01:10:12.510
are set up to make things nice
and clean and interpretable,

01:10:12.510 --> 01:10:16.780
scientists typically remove
environmental variability.

01:10:16.780 --> 01:10:19.430
Scientists typically
artificially

01:10:19.430 --> 01:10:24.470
have boosted up the seeming
heritability of a trait.

01:10:24.470 --> 01:10:26.160
What does that tell you?

01:10:26.160 --> 01:10:30.220
The more different environments
you study a trait in,

01:10:30.220 --> 01:10:32.860
the lower the heritability
is going to be.

01:10:32.860 --> 01:10:34.880
Because you are
going to be getting

01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:38.940
more and more opportunities
for things to be different.

01:10:38.940 --> 01:10:42.590
More opportunities to be
able to say, it depends.

01:10:42.590 --> 01:10:44.670
It depends on which environment.

01:10:44.670 --> 01:10:47.660
We've just studied it in
99 different environments,

01:10:47.660 --> 01:10:49.730
and it always looks like this.

01:10:49.730 --> 01:10:51.680
No difference by
environment, and genes

01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:53.150
always make a huge difference.

01:10:53.150 --> 01:10:56.330
And then you go out and,
before dying of fatigue,

01:10:56.330 --> 01:10:58.500
you study it in the
hundredth environment,

01:10:58.500 --> 01:11:01.320
and it now looks like
this sort of thing.

01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:05.895
What you've just learned is,
this is a "it depends" example.

01:11:05.895 --> 01:11:09.150
And the more environments
you study something in,

01:11:09.150 --> 01:11:11.840
the lower heritability
is going to be.

01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:14.940
Translating that into
English, the more environments

01:11:14.940 --> 01:11:18.010
you study a genetically
influenced trait,

01:11:18.010 --> 01:11:20.230
the less interesting
and important

01:11:20.230 --> 01:11:22.152
the genes are going to be.

01:11:22.152 --> 01:11:23.800
The less interesting
and important

01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:25.910
they're going to
be in answering,

01:11:25.910 --> 01:11:28.402
what does this gene have
to do with whatever?

01:11:28.402 --> 01:11:30.110
And what we're seeing
over and over again

01:11:30.110 --> 01:11:32.400
is, the only way to answer
it over and over again

01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:34.110
is, it's going to
be an "it depends."

01:11:34.110 --> 01:11:35.510
It depends on the environment.

01:11:35.510 --> 01:11:38.960
Ultimately-- as I said a
little while ago-- ultimately,

01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:43.530
it winds up being meaningless
to ask what a gene does.

01:11:43.530 --> 01:11:47.070
Ultimately, the only
really truly scientific way

01:11:47.070 --> 01:11:48.760
you can answer a
question like that

01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:54.120
is, what does this gene do in
this particular environment?

01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:57.057
People make this big deal out
of oh, genes do something,

01:11:57.057 --> 01:11:58.140
environments do something.

01:11:58.140 --> 01:12:00.920
And every now and
then, hooray, they

01:12:00.920 --> 01:12:04.640
interact in some exciting way
in teaching the gene environment

01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:06.660
interaction cliche,
that's what's

01:12:06.660 --> 01:12:08.640
happening every single time.

01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:11.130
And that winds up
being the basis of that

01:12:11.130 --> 01:12:13.580
quote from Paul Ehrlich
in this department

01:12:13.580 --> 01:12:16.120
that I put on the
handout, which is great,

01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:20.790
summarizes this entire
point, asking whether genes

01:12:20.790 --> 01:12:23.580
or environment have more
to do with some trait

01:12:23.580 --> 01:12:26.720
is akin to asking whether
height or length have more

01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:28.950
to do with the volume
of a rectangle.

01:12:28.950 --> 01:12:30.630
They're inseparable.

01:12:30.630 --> 01:12:33.430
There is no such thing
as a gene influence

01:12:33.430 --> 01:12:37.970
outside the context of an
environmental interaction.

01:12:37.970 --> 01:12:38.900
OK.

01:12:38.900 --> 01:12:41.390
Let's look more at
what this looks like.

01:12:41.390 --> 01:12:43.740
Here, this being
one great example.

01:12:43.740 --> 01:12:45.900
And this being this iconic one.

01:12:45.900 --> 01:12:50.520
And this is a finding that
is destined to be, like,

01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:52.390
the most important
in the last quarter

01:12:52.390 --> 01:12:54.640
century in biological
psychiatry.

01:12:54.640 --> 01:12:57.330
It is the most
powerful demonstration

01:12:57.330 --> 01:13:03.200
in the realm of abnormal human
behavior of what your genotype

01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:04.830
has to do with your behavior.

01:13:04.830 --> 01:13:08.700
The most amazing, logical,
intuitively reasonable

01:13:08.700 --> 01:13:11.310
demonstration of "it depends."

01:13:11.310 --> 01:13:14.900
It depends on how stressful
the childhood environment was.

01:13:14.900 --> 01:13:16.500
Really great.

01:13:16.500 --> 01:13:18.220
Bringing things
back to last weeks

01:13:18.220 --> 01:13:20.900
sort of molecular
lectures, people already

01:13:20.900 --> 01:13:22.550
know who study this.

01:13:22.550 --> 01:13:26.150
The two different versions
of the gene, certain classes

01:13:26.150 --> 01:13:31.540
of stress hormones interact with
the two versions differently.

01:13:31.540 --> 01:13:35.070
When stress hormone levels
aren't particularly raised,

01:13:35.070 --> 01:13:37.910
that difference isn't
being manifested.

01:13:37.910 --> 01:13:40.210
The more of a history
of stress-- and it's

01:13:40.210 --> 01:13:42.890
obviously more mechanical,
more complicated

01:13:42.890 --> 01:13:46.650
than just how much you're
exposed to-- but the promoters,

01:13:46.650 --> 01:13:49.380
the variation here
is in the promoters.

01:13:49.380 --> 01:13:51.760
The promoters
interact differently

01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:54.730
with those glucocorticoid
stress hormones.

01:13:54.730 --> 01:13:57.020
In the absence of the
glucocorticoid stress hormones,

01:13:57.020 --> 01:14:00.110
because in the absence
of something exciting,

01:14:00.110 --> 01:14:03.700
your genetic difference
makes no difference.

01:14:03.700 --> 01:14:07.872
So we've just translated
an epidemiological answer--

01:14:07.872 --> 01:14:09.830
what does this gene have
to do with depression?

01:14:09.830 --> 01:14:11.010
It depends.

01:14:11.010 --> 01:14:13.930
It depends on your
childhood stress history.

01:14:13.930 --> 01:14:17.797
We've just translated that into
last week's molecular biology,

01:14:17.797 --> 01:14:20.380
what does this genetic variance
have to do with whether or not

01:14:20.380 --> 01:14:21.213
you have depression?

01:14:21.213 --> 01:14:22.540
It depends.

01:14:22.540 --> 01:14:26.730
It depends on how much childhood
exposure to glucocorticoids

01:14:26.730 --> 01:14:27.710
you had.

01:14:27.710 --> 01:14:30.530
So we've just leaped
from analyzing this

01:14:30.530 --> 01:14:33.260
in the context of this
field, to translating that

01:14:33.260 --> 01:14:34.780
into last week.

01:14:34.780 --> 01:14:36.720
And translating that
into the endocrine

01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:40.390
lectures that are going to come
next week, beginning to show,

01:14:40.390 --> 01:14:42.150
OK, you're an epidemiologist.

01:14:42.150 --> 01:14:45.077
The answer is, what
sort of environment?

01:14:45.077 --> 01:14:46.160
You're an endocrinologist.

01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:49.690
The answer is, well, the
hormonal environment.

01:14:49.690 --> 01:14:52.570
Whether you define it,
it's the same punch line.

01:14:52.570 --> 01:14:53.830
It depends.

01:14:53.830 --> 01:14:55.950
It depends on the environment.

01:14:55.950 --> 01:14:59.320
So this is the best,
most amazing example

01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:01.040
of this in all of psychiatry.

01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:04.400
Except, these guys--
Caspian colleagues--

01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:07.380
measured something
else and they got just

01:15:07.380 --> 01:15:09.760
as bestest of an
answer for that.

01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:13.790
Which is, they looked at
another gene that has variation.

01:15:13.790 --> 01:15:15.840
One we will hear
about down the line.

01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:19.270
A gene called MAO,
monoamine oxidase.

01:15:19.270 --> 01:15:23.320
All we need to know right now
is, a gazillion animal studies

01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:26.420
suggest that one
version of the gene

01:15:26.420 --> 01:15:30.420
predisposes more towards
aggression than the other.

01:15:30.420 --> 01:15:31.320
Whoa.

01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:34.070
So they've got
17,000 people who've

01:15:34.070 --> 01:15:36.350
just had 25 years
worth of opportunity

01:15:36.350 --> 01:15:38.560
to be aggressive or not,
and they got the genes.

01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:42.750
And now they ask the question,
rather than at age 25,

01:15:42.750 --> 01:15:45.300
has this person ever had a
major clinical depression?

01:15:45.300 --> 01:15:48.520
Now they ask, at age
25, has this person ever

01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:50.560
been in trouble with
the law for some sort

01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:53.030
of antisocial behavior?

01:15:53.030 --> 01:15:55.180
Antisocial behavior
is the new jargon

01:15:55.180 --> 01:15:58.550
for what used to be called
sociopathic behavior.

01:15:58.550 --> 01:16:01.220
Has this person been
in trouble with the law

01:16:01.220 --> 01:16:03.640
for sociopathic
behavior, anti-social.

01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:07.670
And does it vary depending on
which version of the MAO gene

01:16:07.670 --> 01:16:08.300
you have?

01:16:08.300 --> 01:16:11.170
And what you get is,
not only is the answer

01:16:11.170 --> 01:16:14.690
"it depends," the
graph is basically

01:16:14.690 --> 01:16:16.460
identical to this one.

01:16:16.460 --> 01:16:19.280
It's superimposable, the
magnitude of the effect.

01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:21.920
What was this in that case?

01:16:21.920 --> 01:16:26.280
Whether or not you had, and how
severe your child history was,

01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:27.580
of abuse.

01:16:27.580 --> 01:16:30.330
The more childhood
abuse you had, the more

01:16:30.330 --> 01:16:32.930
having the wrong
version of the gene

01:16:32.930 --> 01:16:35.870
increased your odds of
having anti-social aggressive

01:16:35.870 --> 01:16:37.290
behavior.

01:16:37.290 --> 01:16:41.240
Once again, a major
dramatic "it depends."

01:16:41.240 --> 01:16:42.345
And it's stunning.

01:16:42.345 --> 01:16:43.970
You look at these
two different papers,

01:16:43.970 --> 01:16:47.190
both were published in
"Science" a couple years apart.

01:16:47.190 --> 01:16:48.940
Landmark studies, all of that.

01:16:48.940 --> 01:16:52.580
And the two graphs really
are virtually superimposable.

01:16:52.580 --> 01:16:54.380
The same magnitude of effects.

01:16:54.380 --> 01:16:55.810
The same answer.

01:16:55.810 --> 01:16:58.340
It depends on your childhood.

01:16:58.340 --> 01:17:00.520
So that is a very
strong example.

01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:05.570
Next one, another one, now you
go back to this gene difference

01:17:05.570 --> 01:17:07.920
with the serotonin,
the depression world.

01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:11.640
And now you study it in monkeys
and the variation there,

01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:14.930
there is a variation in
brain chemistry related

01:17:14.930 --> 01:17:16.940
to depression, all
of that depending

01:17:16.940 --> 01:17:20.690
on how stressful the
monkey's childhood was.

01:17:20.690 --> 01:17:23.100
Same exact sort of finding.

01:17:23.100 --> 01:17:24.180
What else?

01:17:24.180 --> 01:17:26.560
Now when you begin to
look at-- going back

01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:30.760
to that world of dopamine
receptors and thrill

01:17:30.760 --> 01:17:34.290
seeking and all of that--
and what you look at

01:17:34.290 --> 01:17:37.100
there is variability
in a certain type

01:17:37.100 --> 01:17:39.580
of different dopamine
receptor gene.

01:17:39.580 --> 01:17:41.780
And what you find
there is, if you

01:17:41.780 --> 01:17:44.020
have a certain
version of that gene,

01:17:44.020 --> 01:17:46.850
you have less social attachment.

01:17:46.850 --> 01:17:50.090
There's a whole psychology
of how you measure that.

01:17:50.090 --> 01:17:51.130
And God knows why.

01:17:51.130 --> 01:17:54.640
It's associated with
less social attachment

01:17:54.640 --> 01:17:57.700
if, and only if,
you got brought up

01:17:57.700 --> 01:18:01.030
by a mother who was
cold and withdrawn.

01:18:01.030 --> 01:18:03.720
There is once again
a "it depends."

01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:06.690
My looking at that, it's
nowhere near as clean as this.

01:18:06.690 --> 01:18:09.210
But it's the same
sort of theme again.

01:18:09.210 --> 01:18:10.940
Another example of it.

01:18:10.940 --> 01:18:14.160
There's another
gene called FAD2.

01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:16.120
And don't even ask me
what it stands for.

01:18:16.120 --> 01:18:20.230
But which version
of the gene you have

01:18:20.230 --> 01:18:24.006
has some predictability
over your IQ.

01:18:24.006 --> 01:18:25.130
That's kind of interesting.

01:18:25.130 --> 01:18:27.690
It's not a big effect, but
nonetheless it is demonstrable.

01:18:27.690 --> 01:18:30.800
Which version of the gene
you have has some control,

01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:33.100
but there's a "it depends."

01:18:33.100 --> 01:18:35.890
Which version of
that gene you have

01:18:35.890 --> 01:18:40.760
has something to do with IQ
if and only if something.

01:18:40.760 --> 01:18:43.880
Let me tell you what
this FAD2 is involved in.

01:18:43.880 --> 01:18:48.520
It is involved in
carbohydrate metabolism.

01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:52.130
Carbohydrates-- carbs,
carbohydrate metabolism-- it

01:18:52.130 --> 01:18:54.690
codes for some enzyme
that breaks down

01:18:54.690 --> 01:18:57.850
carbohydrates and no
doubt, some certain kind.

01:18:57.850 --> 01:18:58.730
OK.

01:18:58.730 --> 01:19:00.180
What's going on here?

01:19:00.180 --> 01:19:01.770
You've got two
different versions

01:19:01.770 --> 01:19:05.330
of a gene that break
down carbohydrates,

01:19:05.330 --> 01:19:06.850
and you've got one version.

01:19:06.850 --> 01:19:10.310
And on the average, you'll
have a higher IQ if and only

01:19:10.310 --> 01:19:12.770
if some environmental
thing was happening.

01:19:12.770 --> 01:19:15.690
Any guesses what that
environmental thing might be?

01:19:20.180 --> 01:19:21.680
High carbohydrate diet.

01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:23.540
High carbohydrate diet, OK.

01:19:23.540 --> 01:19:25.970
That makes tons of
sense, yes indeed.

01:19:25.970 --> 01:19:27.700
That winds up being relevant.

01:19:27.700 --> 01:19:30.010
Remember, you're
now-- not remember,

01:19:30.010 --> 01:19:31.520
because I didn't
say it already--

01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:33.270
but you're looking
at IQ in kids.

01:19:33.270 --> 01:19:36.760
So you're looking now
at carbohydrate stuff

01:19:36.760 --> 01:19:38.060
going on early in life.

01:19:38.060 --> 01:19:39.850
So frame it in that context.

01:19:39.850 --> 01:19:41.800
So, we've got a start
of an answer here.

01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:43.500
So what else could be happening?

01:19:43.500 --> 01:19:46.620
If and only if the
version you have

01:19:46.620 --> 01:19:50.430
of this gene that's involved
in breaking down carbohydrates,

01:19:50.430 --> 01:19:52.990
translating into
how you're dealing

01:19:52.990 --> 01:19:55.090
with the amount of
carbohydrates in your diet,

01:19:55.090 --> 01:19:58.970
gets you a different IQ
with an if and only if.

01:19:58.970 --> 01:20:01.050
What would the if
and only if be?

01:20:01.050 --> 01:20:03.830
Build on that comment there.

01:20:03.830 --> 01:20:05.206
What else could it be?

01:20:09.800 --> 01:20:12.790
OK, I'm not even going to look.

01:20:12.790 --> 01:20:16.295
Somebody shout out an answer.

01:20:16.295 --> 01:20:17.440
[INAUDIBLE]

01:20:17.440 --> 01:20:18.100
You're right!

01:20:18.100 --> 01:20:19.600
OK, Who started?

01:20:19.600 --> 01:20:21.410
Somebody started
saying something.

01:20:21.410 --> 01:20:23.100
Who started saying something?

01:20:23.100 --> 01:20:24.390
OK.

01:20:24.390 --> 01:20:25.900
Any other ideas?

01:20:25.900 --> 01:20:27.230
Breast feeding.

01:20:27.230 --> 01:20:29.560
Who said that?

01:20:29.560 --> 01:20:31.190
Look at that, they
start pointing.

01:20:31.190 --> 01:20:32.890
The person doesn't even fess up.

01:20:32.890 --> 01:20:33.745
Who said that?

01:20:33.745 --> 01:20:34.900
It's in your notes.

01:20:34.900 --> 01:20:35.850
You're right.

01:20:35.850 --> 01:20:39.250
[LAUGHTER]

01:20:39.250 --> 01:20:40.214
OK.

01:20:40.214 --> 01:20:41.696
You want to be that way.

01:20:44.660 --> 01:20:48.010
I'm out of here.

01:20:48.010 --> 01:20:48.800
OK.

01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:54.230
So if and only if you read the
damn notes, as it turns out.

01:20:54.230 --> 01:20:55.060
Yes!

01:20:55.060 --> 01:20:55.990
Breastfeeding.

01:20:55.990 --> 01:20:57.180
OK.

01:20:57.180 --> 01:21:00.560
If and only if you were having
a particular type of diet

01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:02.790
very early in life
that is extremely

01:21:02.790 --> 01:21:05.890
rich in the types
of carbohydrates

01:21:05.890 --> 01:21:07.910
that this enzyme works on.

01:21:07.910 --> 01:21:10.820
So a very dramatic
if and only if there.

01:21:10.820 --> 01:21:12.567
I don't know why I
write that stuff.

01:21:12.567 --> 01:21:13.900
I don't know why I show up here.

01:21:13.900 --> 01:21:15.316
I should be doing
one or the other

01:21:15.316 --> 01:21:18.250
and some sort of environment
interaction thing.

01:21:18.250 --> 01:21:19.840
So yeah, breastfeeding.

01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:20.420
OK.

01:21:20.420 --> 01:21:23.770
So one more example, a
very interesting one.

01:21:23.770 --> 01:21:26.750
And this is one that has at
some point or other, I'd bet,

01:21:26.750 --> 01:21:29.500
been pertinent to every
single person in this room.

01:21:29.500 --> 01:21:32.310
Which is, there's another
genetic difference

01:21:32.310 --> 01:21:36.240
that has something to do with
a certain cognitive aptitude.

01:21:36.240 --> 01:21:38.780
And this one
everybody knows about.

01:21:38.780 --> 01:21:41.300
And this one is as follows.

01:21:41.300 --> 01:21:44.610
If you have-- there's two
different versions of this sort

01:21:44.610 --> 01:21:48.290
of genetic picture
and they're associated

01:21:48.290 --> 01:21:50.300
with different
levels of aptitude

01:21:50.300 --> 01:21:52.010
in this particular
cognitive realm--

01:21:52.010 --> 01:21:55.800
this is not a world any more
of one single gene at a time.

01:21:55.800 --> 01:21:57.455
FAD2, any of these.

01:21:57.455 --> 01:22:00.020
This instead is talking
about a whole bunch of genes.

01:22:00.020 --> 01:22:04.130
If you have a Y
chromosome or not.

01:22:04.130 --> 01:22:06.330
If you are male or female.

01:22:06.330 --> 01:22:07.810
A genetic trait.

01:22:07.810 --> 01:22:10.150
And what is the thing
that has been demonstrated

01:22:10.150 --> 01:22:12.080
most consistently
in the literature

01:22:12.080 --> 01:22:14.120
forever and ever
and ever in terms

01:22:14.120 --> 01:22:17.580
of a gender difference in
a cognitive skill in math

01:22:17.580 --> 01:22:18.840
performance.

01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:20.530
That has come through endlessly.

01:22:20.530 --> 01:22:22.790
I've already talked
about it the other week.

01:22:22.790 --> 01:22:26.090
A small difference in the
average median performance

01:22:26.090 --> 01:22:29.520
on junior high school
old Johns Hopkins

01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:32.410
superstar kids taking the SATs.

01:22:32.410 --> 01:22:35.330
But a big difference in the tail
at the end, high performance,

01:22:35.330 --> 01:22:36.120
all of that.

01:22:36.120 --> 01:22:39.090
This comes up in
endless, endless studies.

01:22:39.090 --> 01:22:42.200
This comes up with kids
at fairly young ages.

01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:45.420
There is this gender difference
on the average-- yes, we're

01:22:45.420 --> 01:22:48.220
saying on the average, don't
forget, you say on the average

01:22:48.220 --> 01:22:50.910
before you even ignore that--
you say on the average,

01:22:50.910 --> 01:22:53.630
boys are better at
math than girls.

01:22:53.630 --> 01:22:55.760
Men are better at
math than women.

01:22:55.760 --> 01:22:58.810
Male plants in the
Gobi desert are better

01:22:58.810 --> 01:23:00.990
in math than female
plants there.

01:23:00.990 --> 01:23:03.830
And so we've got a
genetic trait here

01:23:03.830 --> 01:23:08.100
being a function of whether
or not you get a Y chromosome.

01:23:08.100 --> 01:23:12.560
But then, a few years ago there
was an astonishingly important

01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:14.710
paper published in "Science."

01:23:14.710 --> 01:23:17.940
And what these people did
was look at math performance

01:23:17.940 --> 01:23:22.960
scores-- of I think it was
480,000 different high school

01:23:22.960 --> 01:23:24.130
kids.

01:23:24.130 --> 01:23:27.240
And all over the world.

01:23:27.240 --> 01:23:29.010
They didn't just
study it in America.

01:23:29.010 --> 01:23:32.740
They studied it in 40
different countries.

01:23:32.740 --> 01:23:35.340
And they asked a
very simple question.

01:23:35.340 --> 01:23:40.440
Which is, are there big
differences in gender quality

01:23:40.440 --> 01:23:42.630
of life issues in this country?

01:23:42.630 --> 01:23:47.370
And there is a whole index that
comes out of the World Health

01:23:47.370 --> 01:23:50.750
UN something or other called
a gender equality index.

01:23:50.750 --> 01:23:53.422
Which takes into account,
like, if there is--

01:23:53.422 --> 01:23:55.670
and if there is, how
dramatic of-- a gender

01:23:55.670 --> 01:23:59.010
difference in educational
opportunities,

01:23:59.010 --> 01:24:02.500
in freedom of movement, in
freedom to serve in an elected

01:24:02.500 --> 01:24:06.170
office, and freedom to vote,
in freedom to choose who you're

01:24:06.170 --> 01:24:10.180
married to, and obviously
the enormous variability

01:24:10.180 --> 01:24:12.250
on this planet in terms of that.

01:24:12.250 --> 01:24:17.390
And what they showed was,
the greater the inadequacies,

01:24:17.390 --> 01:24:20.590
the greater the difference
in gender treatment

01:24:20.590 --> 01:24:23.470
in the society across
40 different countries,

01:24:23.470 --> 01:24:27.790
the bigger the difference
there was in math scores.

01:24:27.790 --> 01:24:29.940
It's not a function
of gender, it's

01:24:29.940 --> 01:24:33.260
which society you're
growing up with your gender.

01:24:33.260 --> 01:24:34.660
What was at the most extreme?

01:24:34.660 --> 01:24:36.810
Let me make sure I get
the countries right here.

01:24:36.810 --> 01:24:39.450
Who had the worst profiles
of the 40 countries

01:24:39.450 --> 01:24:42.710
in terms of the biggest gender
differences in these quality

01:24:42.710 --> 01:24:43.920
of life measures?

01:24:43.920 --> 01:24:47.290
Turkey, Tunisia,
and South Korea.

01:24:47.290 --> 01:24:48.890
Where was the United States?

01:24:48.890 --> 01:24:50.420
Sitting somewhere
around the middle

01:24:50.420 --> 01:24:52.440
with most Western
European countries.

01:24:52.440 --> 01:24:55.050
And which were the countries
on earth which, as a block,

01:24:55.050 --> 01:24:58.620
had the lowest degree of
different treatment of people

01:24:58.620 --> 01:25:00.570
in their society
based on gender?

01:25:00.570 --> 01:25:04.830
The ever handy wonderful
Utopian Scandinavians.

01:25:04.830 --> 01:25:06.610
So in comes the Scandinavians.

01:25:06.610 --> 01:25:08.440
And what you show
is, by the time

01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:11.900
you look at the country on
Earth that has the least gender

01:25:11.900 --> 01:25:14.960
differentiation of
any, which is Iceland,

01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:16.910
you notice something different.

01:25:16.910 --> 01:25:19.310
There still is a
gender difference.

01:25:19.310 --> 01:25:24.710
In Iceland, girls are better
at math than boys, slightly.

01:25:24.710 --> 01:25:27.090
A small difference
going on there.

01:25:27.090 --> 01:25:30.320
But nonetheless, as you go
from the countries in which

01:25:30.320 --> 01:25:33.720
from day one, girls
transitioning into women

01:25:33.720 --> 01:25:35.990
are given the most
constraints of freedom

01:25:35.990 --> 01:25:39.170
of life, that's where you're
going to see the biggest math

01:25:39.170 --> 01:25:40.510
difference scores.

01:25:40.510 --> 01:25:44.060
And you look at less and less
of those sort of inequities.

01:25:44.060 --> 01:25:46.980
And the gender difference
in the math score,

01:25:46.980 --> 01:25:49.290
by the time it's at the
Scandinavian countries,

01:25:49.290 --> 01:25:50.460
it's down to zero.

01:25:50.460 --> 01:25:53.260
And then you get to Iceland,
and it actually reverses.

01:25:53.260 --> 01:25:56.800
It's got nothing to do
with your Y chromosome.

01:25:56.800 --> 01:25:58.770
We immediately come
back to the first

01:25:58.770 --> 01:26:02.610
of those questions from before,
that diagnostic question.

01:26:02.610 --> 01:26:03.880
You've got a choice.

01:26:03.880 --> 01:26:07.590
You want to have a sense of,
in this population-- nah,

01:26:07.590 --> 01:26:08.927
even at the individual level.

01:26:08.927 --> 01:26:09.760
You've got a choice.

01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:11.690
You're comparing
two individuals,

01:26:11.690 --> 01:26:14.410
and you want to
guess which one is

01:26:14.410 --> 01:26:16.140
better at math than the other.

01:26:16.140 --> 01:26:19.310
You can either
know their gender,

01:26:19.310 --> 01:26:23.530
or you could know whether they
grew up in Tunisia or Iceland.

01:26:23.530 --> 01:26:25.380
Which fact do you want to know?

01:26:25.380 --> 01:26:27.120
You want to know
about environment.

01:26:27.120 --> 01:26:31.090
Environment is vastly
more powerful there.

01:26:31.090 --> 01:26:33.520
Another feature of that
that has been interesting.

01:26:33.520 --> 01:26:35.700
So you then say
OK, the extremes.

01:26:35.700 --> 01:26:39.300
OK, so in some societies, the
means are exactly the same.

01:26:39.300 --> 01:26:42.180
But what about that difference
way out at the highest

01:26:42.180 --> 01:26:43.390
level of performance.

01:26:43.390 --> 01:26:46.010
As I mentioned the other
day, in the mid-1980s,

01:26:46.010 --> 01:26:48.930
looking at the highest first
percentile of math performance

01:26:48.930 --> 01:26:51.130
on junior high school
kids with their SATs,

01:26:51.130 --> 01:26:55.750
and there was a 13:1 ratio
of males to females in there.

01:26:55.750 --> 01:26:58.540
When it was last
studied a few years ago,

01:26:58.540 --> 01:27:01.550
it's down to a 3:1 ratio.

01:27:01.550 --> 01:27:04.800
Oh, that's obviously due to
evolution over the last 20

01:27:04.800 --> 01:27:07.420
years, because it's
got to be due to genes.

01:27:07.420 --> 01:27:12.530
That's like saying genes explain
the fact that in 1980s people,

01:27:12.530 --> 01:27:15.630
like, wore pads
on their shoulders

01:27:15.630 --> 01:27:19.040
and, like, power sneakers
to work or whatever.

01:27:19.040 --> 01:27:21.120
And the fact that
nobody does that anymore

01:27:21.120 --> 01:27:26.800
shows that the gene for wearing
that on your woman executive

01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:29.980
decor deal has evolved.

01:27:29.980 --> 01:27:31.550
That's asinine.

01:27:31.550 --> 01:27:35.520
You do not go from 13:1
to 3:1 with a trait

01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:38.610
in 20 years in a
highly interbreeding

01:27:38.610 --> 01:27:40.830
mixed population-- in
other words, humans--

01:27:40.830 --> 01:27:42.760
and have this as
a genetic trait.

01:27:42.760 --> 01:27:45.750
Even function at the
extreme has squat

01:27:45.750 --> 01:27:49.130
to do with the
genetics of gender.

01:27:49.130 --> 01:27:52.420
It's, I want to know what
society the person got

01:27:52.420 --> 01:27:53.200
raised in.

01:27:53.200 --> 01:27:55.770
I could care less what
their chromosome is.

01:27:55.770 --> 01:27:57.510
If I want to know
how good they're

01:27:57.510 --> 01:28:00.350
likely to be at math
compared to the other person,

01:28:00.350 --> 01:28:02.250
tell me where they grew up.

01:28:02.250 --> 01:28:05.050
That's the most
important thing to know.

01:28:05.050 --> 01:28:06.700
Interesting additional thing.

01:28:06.700 --> 01:28:10.260
The second most reliable
finding in all of measures

01:28:10.260 --> 01:28:13.330
of cognitive aptitude thing
that has a gender difference

01:28:13.330 --> 01:28:18.340
is, on the average, girls being
better at verbal performance

01:28:18.340 --> 01:28:19.790
tasks than boys.

01:28:19.790 --> 01:28:22.590
Women than men, all
that sort of thing.

01:28:22.590 --> 01:28:25.530
So what's going on in those
40 different countries there?

01:28:25.530 --> 01:28:30.340
What you wind up seeing is,
it depends on which country

01:28:30.340 --> 01:28:30.840
you're in.

01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:33.580
It depends on that
gender equality index.

01:28:33.580 --> 01:28:36.380
And what you see is, in
the worst countries there,

01:28:36.380 --> 01:28:40.180
by these measures, Tunisia-- who
else was it?-- Tunisia, Turkey,

01:28:40.180 --> 01:28:43.530
and South Korea, what
you see is, yeah,

01:28:43.530 --> 01:28:47.500
women get better scores
on verbal tests than men.

01:28:47.500 --> 01:28:50.170
And as you go to the
more equal places,

01:28:50.170 --> 01:28:53.080
the gender difference increases.

01:28:53.080 --> 01:28:55.610
In other words, you've
got one of these.

01:28:55.610 --> 01:28:58.660
The more gender
equal a society is,

01:28:58.660 --> 01:29:01.920
the less of a sex difference
there is in math capabilities

01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:05.770
and the bigger the advantage
is for females over males

01:29:05.770 --> 01:29:07.690
in verbal performance.

01:29:07.690 --> 01:29:10.450
It's got everything to do
with what society you're in.

01:29:10.450 --> 01:29:14.020
This gender difference in
this realm of cognitive skills

01:29:14.020 --> 01:29:16.020
means next to nothing.

01:29:16.020 --> 01:29:18.004
And if I had any
technological skills--

01:29:18.004 --> 01:29:19.420
I kept saying I
was going to bring

01:29:19.420 --> 01:29:21.300
the figure from this
paper, I'll have

01:29:21.300 --> 01:29:23.580
it posted-- because
this one figure,

01:29:23.580 --> 01:29:25.840
it's across all these--
you just look at it

01:29:25.840 --> 01:29:27.620
and there's the answer.

01:29:27.620 --> 01:29:33.230
It's got nothing to do with the
genetics of gender difference.

01:29:33.230 --> 01:29:38.030
OK, so what else would one
want to emphasize here?

01:29:38.030 --> 01:29:40.860
OK, what else would one
want to emphasize here?

01:29:40.860 --> 01:29:44.500
Which is, this is a total
mess and totally complicated.

01:29:44.500 --> 01:29:47.410
OK what have we gotten to so
far in this field of behavior

01:29:47.410 --> 01:29:48.210
genetics?

01:29:48.210 --> 01:29:49.930
There's all these
different ancient ways

01:29:49.930 --> 01:29:51.252
of inferring something.

01:29:51.252 --> 01:29:53.585
Twins, adoption, there's the
much more modern way, which

01:29:53.585 --> 01:29:55.160
is finding the actual genes.

01:29:55.160 --> 01:29:55.910
That's wonderful.

01:29:55.910 --> 01:29:57.000
That's exciting.

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:58.970
Nonetheless, over
and over and over,

01:29:58.970 --> 01:30:00.920
an environment
gets understudied.

01:30:00.920 --> 01:30:03.140
Environment is far more
subtle than you think.

01:30:03.140 --> 01:30:05.640
Environment starts earlier
in life than you think.

01:30:05.640 --> 01:30:08.780
And when you do it in a very
formal quantitative way,

01:30:08.780 --> 01:30:11.780
analyzing what genetic
influences are about,

01:30:11.780 --> 01:30:14.330
you discover that
scientists study things

01:30:14.330 --> 01:30:17.310
under circumstances where
you constantly underestimate

01:30:17.310 --> 01:30:18.810
the importance of environment.

01:30:18.810 --> 01:30:20.730
Blah, blah, etc., etc.

01:30:20.730 --> 01:30:22.990
But at the end of
the day, don't genes

01:30:22.990 --> 01:30:24.900
have something to do
with something or other

01:30:24.900 --> 01:30:26.040
going on with this?

01:30:26.040 --> 01:30:31.240
And obviously, obviously they
have some very important roles.

01:30:31.240 --> 01:30:35.800
You have genes that completely
determine aspects of behavior.

01:30:35.800 --> 01:30:39.630
Single genes that completely
determine your intelligence

01:30:39.630 --> 01:30:42.200
if you are a housefly.

01:30:42.200 --> 01:30:44.160
Lots of interesting
studies there showing

01:30:44.160 --> 01:30:47.230
single gene determination,
a lot of these behaviors.

01:30:47.230 --> 01:30:50.740
And it doesn't matter sort of
what the economic opportunities

01:30:50.740 --> 01:30:53.680
are for houseflies in that
country versus humans.

01:30:53.680 --> 01:30:55.760
What you see there
is yeah, there

01:30:55.760 --> 01:30:59.010
are realms of behavioral
biology where genes

01:30:59.010 --> 01:31:01.000
play very, very strong roles.

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.010
And we will certainly
see some of them

01:31:03.010 --> 01:31:04.690
in the lectures to come.

01:31:04.690 --> 01:31:07.080
But with two qualifiers.

01:31:07.080 --> 01:31:09.600
The first one we
heard the other day.

01:31:09.600 --> 01:31:13.370
Which is, even when, with all
of these criticisms on board

01:31:13.370 --> 01:31:15.550
and you've got
every critical tool

01:31:15.550 --> 01:31:18.350
to slice up anybody
arguing that here's

01:31:18.350 --> 01:31:21.040
a high heritability important
genetic component, blah, blah,

01:31:21.040 --> 01:31:21.750
etc.

01:31:21.750 --> 01:31:23.860
You've completely
cut it to pieces,

01:31:23.860 --> 01:31:25.970
and there still is
a gene that seems

01:31:25.970 --> 01:31:29.750
to be doing something important
for trait X. What we heard

01:31:29.750 --> 01:31:32.860
about the other day is,
nonetheless, think about

01:31:32.860 --> 01:31:36.670
if there is an indirect genetic
route for getting there.

01:31:36.670 --> 01:31:38.910
Is there a gene
for extroversion?

01:31:38.910 --> 01:31:41.480
Or is there a gene
for your height

01:31:41.480 --> 01:31:43.310
and how people of your
height are treated?

01:31:43.310 --> 01:31:45.910
Is there a gene for
picking at grubs?

01:31:45.910 --> 01:31:49.100
Or is there a gene for if you're
really tall, you pick at grubs

01:31:49.100 --> 01:31:50.640
and people don't
make fun of you.

01:31:50.640 --> 01:31:54.300
Is all of that business about
indirect genetic effects?

01:31:54.300 --> 01:31:58.980
So even when you see
a gene for something,

01:31:58.980 --> 01:32:02.510
you have to begin to ask to
make sure that you are not,

01:32:02.510 --> 01:32:05.110
in fact, looking at
an indirect effect.

01:32:05.110 --> 01:32:06.520
Final qualifier.

01:32:06.520 --> 01:32:09.640
When you look at the
really interesting genes

01:32:09.640 --> 01:32:11.176
in terms of what they do.

01:32:11.176 --> 01:32:12.550
When you look at
some of the ones

01:32:12.550 --> 01:32:14.350
that have the most
to do, say, with what

01:32:14.350 --> 01:32:17.270
differentiates our genome
from the chimp genome.

01:32:17.270 --> 01:32:21.400
When you look at things like
juggling your DNA just when

01:32:21.400 --> 01:32:25.000
you're making new neurons,
what you see over and over is,

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:28.580
what human genes are
about most dramatically

01:32:28.580 --> 01:32:31.820
is coding for ways in
which you have freedom

01:32:31.820 --> 01:32:33.860
from the effects of genetics.

01:32:33.860 --> 01:32:37.730
And that is going to be a
theme endlessly in the lectures

01:32:37.730 --> 01:32:38.490
to come.

01:32:38.490 --> 01:32:40.150
OK.

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:08.280
Stanford University.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.590
--push off into new terrain,
here-- yet another bucket.

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.430
But before doing that,
various bits of feedback

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:16.510
from office hours.

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:17.850
Hearing from TAs.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.790
Getting a sense of where
the grand, gaping craters

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:23.620
of confusion are so far.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:25.280
And apparently an
awful lot of them

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.670
were provided in the
last two days of lectures

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:28.860
with behavior genetics.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.640
Various issues that came up.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.830
Clearly, one of the most
complicated, inaccessible,

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:35.450
subtle, pain in
the neck concepts

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.420
in the whole class, which is
this heritability business.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.339
So memorize the
following two sentences,

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:43.880
because it all comes down to
the difference between something

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:48.750
that is inherited and
how heritable a trait is.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.510
The fact that humans
overwhelmingly

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.840
have five fingers reflects the
fact that the number of fingers

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.010
is an inherited trait.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.920
The fact that, when there are
some circumstances of humans

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.880
having other than
five fingers, it

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.510
is overwhelmingly
due to environmental

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.040
something-or-others is
an indication of the fact

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.770
that, nonetheless, variability
around the number of fingers--

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.880
heritability is essentially 0%.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.610
So get those two
sorted out, and you

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.390
have those two concepts
all under your belt

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.170
and very useful.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:22.010
Why is it useful?

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:23.890
First off, why is
this one useful?

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.970
Because it is important
to know the distinction.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.360
Everybody, for one
thing, out there

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.870
tends to view these as
telling the same thing.

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.910
And insofar as they think
it says the same thing,

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.370
they think that both terms
are referring to this.

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:41.620
Something that is genetically
regulated, genetically

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.020
determined-- whatever.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.330
Two totally different terms.

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.500
So one reason to
obsess over this

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.160
is that when the
newspapers give us

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.900
our sound bite of
"scientists report that,"

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.020
it's usually this one
that they're reporting,

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.790
with one of those marvelously
misleading numbers.

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.180
Which then sets people up
for thinking they have just

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.340
been told how much
do genes "determine"

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.300
some average feature
of this trait.

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:05.850
So, important to
tell them apart.

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.180
The other reason of
getting this sorted out

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.610
is not to only unlearn
the nonsense aspects

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.350
and misinterpreting this term
but because understanding

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.570
that term gives you
a lot of insights

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.600
into when and how
you are getting

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.360
gene-environment interactions.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.400
Caveat with that.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.450
Saying "when and how
you're getting"--

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.710
you're always getting
gene-environment interactions.

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.380
Remember the quote
from the other day.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.250
It's like saying,
which contributes

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.019
more to the volume of a square,
or the height, or the length,

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:33.310
or the roundiness, or whatever?

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.870
Yes, it's always
gene-environment interactions.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.880
Saying, in what
ways are there some

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.140
of the more interesting ones,
dramatic ones, in what realms--

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.670
Understand this, and you
avoid this confusion.

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.120
Understand this,
and it gives you

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.360
insights into
gene-environment interactions.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.860
OK.

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.330
Other issues that are coming up.

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.190
By now, we've looked at three
different broad approaches

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.660
to the biology of
social behavior.

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.105
The evolutionary stuff--
broadly stated-- the molecular,

00:02:59.105 --> 00:03:00.580
the behavior genetics.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.500
And what should
be clear by now is

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.560
if you were living inside
one of those buckets,

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.610
you hate each of the other
two and trash them entirely.

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.820
So we get to the first of our
great, conflicting points,

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.940
which is, does that mean
one of these is wrong?

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.600
No, one of them is not wrong.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:15.600
None of them are wrong.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.130
Some are more right
than others, and some

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:19.560
are a lot better than others.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.730
But nonetheless,
these are all-- again,

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.060
from the very first
lecture-- different levels

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.250
of description.

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.230
Another way to begin to
think about this, in terms

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.420
of what we've now
been focusing on--

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.410
and this sort of coming up
from some questions afterward.

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.230
So by now we've had
the term "epigenetics."

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.450
That's come in in the
last couple of lectures.

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.110
And there are at least
three different levels,

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.280
three different buckets, with
which you can define the term.

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.850
What is epigenetics?

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.840
Epigenetics is the way
the culture, environment--

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.000
all of that-- affects biology.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.090
That's a certain broad
way of stating that.

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.950
NodA stated that
way, you are making

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.090
biology synonymous with
genetics, which ain't so.

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.340
But nonetheless, that's
a certain broad level

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:02.270
of stating it.

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:04.720
In another discipline,
a very sort

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.990
of first pass at
molecular stuff,

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:08.640
what is epigenetics about?

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.710
It's the way in which
environments turns genes

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:13.690
on and off.

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.640
And at another level of
explanation, more reductive,

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.430
what is epigenetics about?

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.860
It is regulation of chromatin
remodeling and methylation

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.360
of genes and all of that.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.040
Do not panic, if
that's not the level

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.200
you want to know it about.

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.825
That's the business
from the other day,

00:04:28.825 --> 00:04:32.640
about changing access
of transcription factors

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.510
to DNA-- jargony
way of doing it.

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:35.010
Don't worry.

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.170
The main point being that this
is a completely different level

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:40.240
of defining this.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.650
This is the whole point in here.

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.310
We are beginning to see
different disciplinary

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:45.030
approaches.

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.930
We are beginning to see where
one discipline has decided

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:49.620
they have answered a question.

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.190
This is how culture
affects biology?

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:53.310
Give me a break.

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.850
Show me which genes
we're talking about!

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:57.240
We're talking about genes, here.

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.220
Give me a break.

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.800
Show me-- is this chromatin
remodeling-- what's

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:01.740
the mechanism for it?

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.190
How reversible is it?

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:06.030
One discipline's answer is the
next one's starting point--

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:06.690
blah, blah.

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:10.250
One discipline's wonderfully
satisfying scientific answer

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:11.830
is the basis for
the next discipline

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:13.630
to be totally
contemptuous of them.

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:15.200
You call that science?

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.830
This is sort of the
whole point, here,

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:20.650
beginning to see how we could
chip out a way between these.

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:23.070
More bits of clarification.

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.940
Amid that, one of the things
that really came through

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:28.030
is-- in the sort of
ratio of praising

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:31.520
to trashing-- I was clearly
spending a lot of the last two

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.230
days trashing the
behavior-genetics approaches.

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:36.430
So a little bit of
clarification, there.

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:38.510
First off, we can
broadly divide what

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:42.190
came the last two days into
classical behavior genetics.

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:45.800
And that's the comparing
monozygotic and dizygotic

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:46.730
twins.

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:48.870
That's the adoption
studies, that's

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:52.400
the twins adopted at birth--
that's all of those approaches,

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:53.020
there.

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:56.430
Those are all the ones where
you were just inferring really

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:58.860
indirectly that there's
something genetically going

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:59.670
on there.

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:02.470
The other half, and much more
sort of the modern behavior

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:05.900
genetics, is marrying these
traditional approaches

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.810
with molecular biology.

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:11.390
And that was the business at
the end-- you know the gene,

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:14.030
and you kind of have an
idea of what it might do.

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:16.590
How does that map onto
behavioral variability

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:17.590
in humans?

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:19.320
You know the
behavior, and you've

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.650
got some sense of
its variability.

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:24.410
How does that map onto
variability in genes?

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:27.470
This is the much more powerful,
contemporary end of it.

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:29.330
So what is this end good for?

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.380
All it's good for is pronouncing
that something's genetic,

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:35.330
or it's 73% genetic
and then you trash it

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:36.570
because that's jibberish.

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:38.200
What it's good for mainly is--

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.080
OK, so you've got
an adoption study--

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.920
classical
behavior-genetic study--

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:46.370
where they're adopted right
at birth, within seconds,

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:48.050
and raised in
different households.

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:50.020
Oh, you haven't ruled
out environment!

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:51.690
Don't forget
prenatal environment.

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:53.310
Oh, you haven't ruled
out environment!

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:55.280
Remember the
nonrandom assignment

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:56.580
of adoption-- all of that.

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:58.410
Does this mean this
approach is useless?

00:06:58.410 --> 00:06:58.910
No.

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:01.880
What it's good for is
demonstrating nonetheless well

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.770
we've just ruled out all
sorts of realms of environment

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:08.250
that people would
guess is consequential.

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:10.340
It's less consequential
than you think.

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:13.350
We haven't ruled out
environment entirely.

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:16.080
And just because it's all
gene-environment interaction,

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:18.910
we certainly can't come up
with a stupid number like that.

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:21.370
But what this is good
for is at least showing,

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:23.920
here's domains where
people-- a lot of people--

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:27.920
would have assumed there is
big environmental effects.

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.470
Much less than you would think.

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:31.360
So that's the much
more conservative, sort

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.850
of sobrietous thing that
people can do with that field.

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:36.120
The fact that far too
few of them actually

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:39.500
do that is reasons to trash--
no, well, nonetheless, there's

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:41.330
lots of good things
in behavior genetics.

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:44.010
But that's the limited
domain where it's useful.

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:46.310
OK, so just beginning
to get a sense, here,

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:49.060
of the various things
that are confusing.

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:52.090
Obviously, no one on
earth in any exam in here

00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:55.230
is going to be asked to
choose which field is better

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:58.390
and which field gives
more-- you know, kum by ya

00:07:58.390 --> 00:07:59.070
and all of that.

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:01.820
But just recognizing
the different approaches

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:04.660
and the wonderful
rainbow diversity of ways

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:09.070
to think about mating in
fruit flies or whatever.

00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:11.100
And just beginning
to see by now,

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:12.870
this is what the
whole class is about.

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:15.800
Speaking of that, I recall
from the first class on that.

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.340
There's somebody in here who
I think was an English Lit

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:19.400
grad student.

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:22.400
If you have a chance, email me
about how it's going in here.

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:22.900
Let's see.

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:23.720
What else?

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:24.220
Next week.

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:24.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:26.830
No, I'm curious.

00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:28.800
I am very pleased
whoever you are--

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:32.450
assuming you haven't fled after
the first class-- is in here.

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:32.950
Let's see.

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:33.480
Other stuff.

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:33.980
OK.

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:34.919
Schedule.

00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:36.900
Next Monday, this
coming Monday, we

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:39.530
will have a lecture on yet
another of our disciplines,

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:40.840
ethology.

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:43.340
And we will see that's
a totally different way

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:44.470
of doing it-- blah, blah.

00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:46.200
Wednesday, Friday,
and the following

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:50.420
Monday are the catch-up lectures
in class, taught by the TAs.

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:51.930
Two of the lectures,
introduction

00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:53.300
to the nervous system.

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:55.650
The third one, introduction
to endocrinology.

00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:57.410
It will be a broad overview.

00:08:57.410 --> 00:08:59.520
It is explicitly designed
for people who have

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:01.460
no prior background in this.

00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:04.090
But what I think is
probably a good idea is,

00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:06.380
even if you believe you
have prior background in it,

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:10.320
maybe assume it might be a good
thing to get a refresher on it.

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:12.420
And this will be very useful.

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:14.490
Following that, we will
have two more lectures--

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:16.680
more advanced topics
and basic features

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:20.140
of neuroendocrinology-- and then
staggering into the midterm.

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:23.220
And then-- oh, then--
the second half comes.

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:25.040
Just a sense of what's coming.

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:25.750
OK.

00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:27.500
So that's where we're at.

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:29.920
So now we transition
to the next subject,

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:32.500
here, which is-- no,
actually, before I forget--

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:35.082
how many-- did people see this--
the article in the New York

00:09:35.082 --> 00:09:37.540
Times this morning about the
study-- the Chutes and Ladders

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:38.040
study?

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:42.920
Did anybody see it?

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:47.080
It was posted this--
nobody saw it?

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:50.839
This was-- you know the
game Chutes and Ladders?

00:09:50.839 --> 00:09:52.380
OK, we all played
Chutes and Ladders.

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:55.590
This was this massive study
funded by the World Health

00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:58.250
Organization where
what they did--

00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:00.160
this is going to be
the definitive study

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:01.080
on the subject.

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:03.399
They showed that
people from Nepal

00:10:03.399 --> 00:10:05.440
are better at playing
Chutes and Ladders than are

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:06.680
people from Belgium.

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:07.970
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:09.420
Cool study!

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:11.810
I don't know how
you guys missed it.

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:12.340
OK.

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:13.710
You need to know about this.

00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:14.670
This is important.

00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:16.450
What do you want to
know about this study?

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:19.700
This massive study shows
that people from Nepal

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:23.040
are better at Chutes and Ladders
than people from Belgium.

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:25.780
Ask me questions, since
you were terribly, woefully

00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:27.280
underinformed about this.

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:28.940
What more information
do you need

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:30.737
to be impressed and
tell everybody about it

00:10:30.737 --> 00:10:31.570
in the dorm tonight?

00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:33.360
What else you want to
know about this study?

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:34.193
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:10:34.693 --> 00:10:35.790
"What does 'better' mean?"

00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:37.760
OK, social relativist.

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:40.826
And does it mean that you
learn more about yourself

00:10:40.826 --> 00:10:41.950
playing Chutes and Ladders?

00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:42.450
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:45.350
Does it mean that you make
the world a happy-- you win!

00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:46.530
You win, win, win!

00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:48.237
OK, so winning is the end point.

00:10:48.237 --> 00:10:48.820
Good question.

00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:50.838
What else do you want
to know about the study?

00:10:50.838 --> 00:10:51.338
Yeah.

00:10:51.338 --> 00:10:52.802
Why?

00:10:52.802 --> 00:10:53.620
Why?

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:54.150
Why?

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:56.200
You ask that?

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.160
Read Aristotle!

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:01.060
Since humans first
pulled out of the mud,

00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:03.980
this has been the thing
we have wanted to know.

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:04.960
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:06.324
And now we do.

00:11:06.324 --> 00:11:07.560
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:10.390
Son, the difference between
knowledge and wisdom--

00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:11.960
OK, so, why?

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:13.380
OK, what else do
you want to know?

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:14.536
What are your questions?

00:11:14.536 --> 00:11:15.036
Yeah.

00:11:15.036 --> 00:11:16.540
What the methods
of the study were.

00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:17.420
The methods.

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:18.350
Very good.

00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:19.610
OK, various methods.

00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:21.780
Do you want to break it
down into more details?

00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:23.680
Given some of the
critical tools you

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.720
have by now, in
terms of methods,

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:28.470
before deciding how impressed
you are or not with this study.

00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:31.750
What sort of questions, now,
in the methodological realm.

00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:33.150
Yeah.

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:34.890
What population
they're sampling?

00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:36.650
Ah, very good question.

00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:39.480
Because we see a first
methodological issue.

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:41.550
Are you getting a
decent sample size,

00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:44.490
so that you're confident that
you can actually say something

00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:46.440
about the population at large.

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:47.790
And that's a great question.

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:51.136
It was done on everybody in
Nepal and everybody in Belgium.

00:11:51.136 --> 00:11:51.950
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:52.980
Good study!

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:54.415
OK, what else do
you want to know?

00:11:54.415 --> 00:11:55.290
What other questions?

00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:55.790
Yeah.

00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:59.290
In terms of their method, did
they pit people from Nepal

00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:03.512
against people from
Belgium in one game, or--

00:12:03.512 --> 00:12:04.970
Well, that's an
excellent question.

00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:08.530
Every single person in the study
from both Belgium and Nepal

00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:10.610
played one game against
every single other person

00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:11.230
in the study.

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:12.362
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:12.362 --> 00:12:13.820
That's why you
haven't been hearing

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:15.926
much about either country
in the news lately.

00:12:15.926 --> 00:12:17.550
They've been very
busy with this study.

00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:20.930
OK, so, good methodology,
large sample size,

00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:22.220
random assignments of games.

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:23.344
What else you want to know?

00:12:23.344 --> 00:12:24.276
Yeah.

00:12:24.276 --> 00:12:27.692
Why-- the question and subject
to ask worth reading about,

00:12:27.692 --> 00:12:29.650
and why did they [INAUDIBLE]?

00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:32.480
Why'd they-- OK, that one again.

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:34.320
It's self-evident.

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:38.980
Know thyself, or know the
Nepalese and the Belgians

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:40.200
or something.

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:43.050
This is a-- I'm glad
I know this now.

00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:44.650
I'm glad they went and did that.

00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:46.310
OK, what else do
you want to know?

00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:47.900
Obviously, a matter
of subjective

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:50.784
taste as to what counts as an
important scientific subject.

00:12:50.784 --> 00:12:51.950
this strikes me as critical.

00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:53.820
What else do you want
to know, in terms

00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:55.850
of what sort of conclusions?

00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:57.600
They kind of hint--
they're not positive--

00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:00.510
but they're kind of hinting
at a genetic component to it.

00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:02.570
Yeah-- question in
the back, there.

00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:04.109
Yeah.

00:13:04.109 --> 00:13:06.830
What skills are involved
in Chutes and Ladders?

00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:08.670
What skills are involved?

00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:11.720
It involves, um-- what is it?

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:13.627
They have a whole list, there.

00:13:13.627 --> 00:13:17.030
Um-- let's see.

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:19.510
Various tasks involving
spatial memory.

00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:24.441
Various tasks involving reversal
performance and telekinesis.

00:13:24.441 --> 00:13:24.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:27.040
So it taps into all
of those domains.

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:29.160
What else do you want
to know about the study?

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:29.660
Yeah

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:30.660
Is it inheritable?

00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:32.040
Is it heritable?

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:34.810
Great-- oh, ho, ho,
is it heritable!

00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:36.420
So which are you asking about?

00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:39.300
OK, well, they did it.

00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:42.040
They are suggesting there's
some degree of heritability.

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:43.240
And they did it right.

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:46.420
They went after all the issues
we've learned about by now.

00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:49.530
Specifically, what I'm saying
is that every single person

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:53.160
in Nepal and in Belgium was
cross-fostered to somebody

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:53.840
in Ecuador.

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:55.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:58.320
In fact, they did it fetally,
right after conception.

00:13:58.320 --> 00:13:58.960
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:00.680
So they can-- the
prenatal stuff.

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:02.960
What else do you want to
know, in order to decide,

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:06.314
am I impressed about the
fact that people from Nepal

00:14:06.314 --> 00:14:08.730
are better at Chutes and Ladders
than people from Belgium?

00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:09.230
Yeah.

00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:11.047
Were they all good at
the exact same amount

00:14:11.047 --> 00:14:13.260
of Chutes and
Ladders as children?

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:14.220
Oh!

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:14.880
Yes.

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:17.090
In fact, none of them had
been exposed to it before.

00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:19.059
They were all raised
in hydroponic gardens,

00:14:19.059 --> 00:14:20.225
without Chutes and Ladders--

00:14:20.225 --> 00:14:20.725
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:20.725 --> 00:14:23.400
--and they were only released
in time for doing this.

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:24.460
OK what else?

00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:25.226
Yes.

00:14:25.226 --> 00:14:28.850
What's the amount of variance
within each individual group?

00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:30.320
Oh, good question!

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:32.540
Here we are, getting
to that-- all of that.

00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:34.890
Everybody got the exact
same score from Nepal,

00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:37.410
and everybody from Belgium
got the exact same score.

00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:38.890
So that's kind of impressive.

00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:40.180
Are you impressed yet?

00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:43.000
Are you impressed enough
yet to go run out of here,

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.580
screaming with this news?

00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:46.436
What else do you need to know?

00:14:46.436 --> 00:14:46.936
Yeah.

00:14:46.936 --> 00:14:47.890
Who went first?

00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:48.720
Who went first?

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:50.650
They randomized it.

00:14:50.650 --> 00:14:56.320
They randomized it by-- the
entire populations played, um--

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:58.640
oh, what is that--

00:14:58.640 --> 00:14:59.140
Roshambo.

00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:00.790
Roshambo, yes.

00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:02.100
They played roshambo.

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:04.980
And, best of all, they had to
play roshambo in Esperanto.

00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:06.557
Yes-- more.

00:15:06.557 --> 00:15:09.360
What was the environment in
which they test [INAUDIBLE]?

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:12.110
OK, they were released
from the hydroponic garden,

00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:15.680
and then all of them were placed
in a completely sterile bubble

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:17.900
environment, where
all they had in there

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:20.790
were copies of People magazine
in a language they didn't

00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:21.430
understand.

00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:22.190
So it was well--

00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:22.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:24.300
Environment was very
well controlled-for.

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:25.558
What else do you need to know?

00:15:25.558 --> 00:15:27.022
How much better were they?

00:15:27.022 --> 00:15:28.690
Like, 0.001--

00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:30.965
Ah!

00:15:30.965 --> 00:15:31.875
Ah!

00:15:31.875 --> 00:15:33.420
There we have it.

00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:35.890
They had a huge sample size.

00:15:35.890 --> 00:15:38.450
They cross-fostered as fetuses.

00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:40.540
They controlled for environment.

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:42.130
They got everybody in there.

00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:43.700
They did the right techniques.

00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:46.170
They randomized at
every possible choice.

00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:47.340
That is so impressive.

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:48.480
That is so impress--

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:50.410
How big is the difference?

00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:52.440
Is it a big difference?

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:56.010
And this is a critical
thing to start putting there

00:15:56.010 --> 00:15:59.380
in your armamentarium
of critical questions,

00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:01.190
to start having skeptical ones.

00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:01.690
Great.

00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:03.720
You've got a whole
bunch of tools by now.

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:04.500
Whoa!

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:05.450
They said "genetic."

00:16:05.450 --> 00:16:06.570
Did you control for this?

00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:07.840
Did you control for that?

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:09.960
Whoa, they see a
difference, there.

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:10.870
Well, wait a second.

00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:12.940
Did they all have the
same exper-- whoa,

00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:14.480
did they have a big sample size?

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:15.640
All of it covered.

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:17.540
Great, wonderful,
perfect science.

00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:19.910
They get every single
bit of it covered, there.

00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:22.510
But then the critical
thing you better ask

00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:24.660
is, how big is the difference?

00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:26.750
Is it impressive or not?

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:29.770
Because we all think we've got
the basic tools-- or hopefully

00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:32.740
we all have the basic tools--
for going at these issues.

00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:35.720
OK, was a study
done in a way that

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:38.050
was clear-cut and unobjective?

00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:39.830
Were people blinded
to whether or not

00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:42.230
this person was
Nepalese or Belgian

00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:44.280
or-- was there
appropriate blinding?

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:48.320
Was it done in a way that you
can falsify your finding--

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:51.760
in a sense, the definition
of experimental science?

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:54.280
Was it designed in--
was it independently

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:55.950
replicated by anybody else?

00:16:55.950 --> 00:16:59.010
We all have those tools
under our belt by now.

00:16:59.010 --> 00:17:01.374
But far too often, we are
not trained, at that point,

00:17:01.374 --> 00:17:02.290
to say, wait a second.

00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:05.920
Before I get all excited, how
big of a difference was it?

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:08.810
Let me give you a
real example of this.

00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:10.760
And this was a paper,
about three years ago,

00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:13.854
in the journal Science-- which
you should get a sense by now

00:17:13.854 --> 00:17:15.520
that the journals
Science and Nature are

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:18.400
the two official biggie
ones on this planet,

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:20.310
in terms of credibility.

00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:24.250
And this was a paper
having to do with IQ.

00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:28.550
And this was a paper having
to do with IQ and birth order.

00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:30.250
And what they showed
in this paper,

00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:34.460
with spectacular statistical
confidence and as much

00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:36.400
of, like, all the
controls in place

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:39.500
as you can ask for from the
hydroponically gardened fetuses

00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:41.890
in Nepal-- they did
absolutely perfectly.

00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:44.660
What they showed in
the definitive study,

00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:48.720
with 250,000
18-year-olds in Norway,

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:51.770
was that there is a
reliable IQ difference

00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:55.440
depending on whether you were
firstborn or latter-born.

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:58.650
OK, how many of
you are firstborn?

00:17:58.650 --> 00:17:59.400
Whoa!

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:02.050
How many of you are only childs?

00:18:02.050 --> 00:18:05.170
OK, how many of
you are number 2?

00:18:05.170 --> 00:18:07.780
How many of you are
more than number 2?

00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:10.130
OK, so, how many of
you think the highest

00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:12.110
IQ comes from the firstborn?

00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:14.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:17.780
OK, and we'll assume the
converse with the other group.

00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:21.180
Did anybody just vote against
their own birth order?

00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:22.080
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:23.220
Whoa-- OK.

00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:26.310
Well, that's-- impressive.

00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:28.430
We salute you.

00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:30.120
OK, so they found a difference.

00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:32.000
They found a
difference, which is,

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.770
firstborns-- in this very
statistically reliable way--

00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:38.470
have higher IQ
than latter-borns.

00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:40.800
They restricted the analysis
just to second-borns

00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:42.100
to keep things clearer.

00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:45.870
And they showed firstborns have
higher IQ than second-borns.

00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:49.160
250,000 people--
as close as you can

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:51.760
get to all the people
from Nepal and Belgian.

00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:53.270
Huge sample size.

00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:54.120
So they report this.

00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:57.040
This was the most
thorough study ever done.

00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:59.490
So what sort of questions
do you want to ask?

00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:02.610
Give me hypotheses
for what's going on.

00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:04.850
Obviously, sort of
one is that, like,

00:19:04.850 --> 00:19:07.060
the parents pour protein
into the ears of firstborn

00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:10.000
and the second one just
gets Fritos or something.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.760
But give me other hypotheses
for what could be happening.

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:15.990
Possible explanation
for this, in terms

00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:21.042
of biological, sociocultural,
endo, immuno, psycho-- yeah.

00:19:21.042 --> 00:19:23.994
I think we already know that
firstborns tend to be more,

00:19:23.994 --> 00:19:27.540
like-- well, I mean-- it's
like the parents-- they're more

00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:30.244
worried about making mistakes,
and they kind of raise them

00:19:30.244 --> 00:19:32.244
harder, so to speak, and
then they sort of relax

00:19:32.244 --> 00:19:33.785
on the second-born
child. [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:33.785 --> 00:19:36.486
firstborns tend to go to college
more and stuff like that--

00:19:36.486 --> 00:19:38.320
do more traditional [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:40.290
OK, so, great hypothesis.

00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:43.189
It's more parental
investment in the firstborn,

00:19:43.189 --> 00:19:45.230
and those are the ones
with the parents freak out

00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:45.655
with everything.

00:19:45.655 --> 00:19:47.180
And by the time
there's a third one,

00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:48.624
they're all foraging
on their own

00:19:48.624 --> 00:19:49.790
when they're six months old.

00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:50.290
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:50.290 --> 00:19:52.450
OK, so, parental investment.

00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:54.730
They went after
that one correctly.

00:19:54.730 --> 00:19:57.380
Here's what they showed,
to rule that out.

00:19:57.380 --> 00:20:00.830
Which was, if you
are an only child,

00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:03.390
you have a lower
IQ-- on the average,

00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:07.680
blah blah-- then firstborns
who have younger siblings.

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:09.190
So it's not parental investment.

00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:12.130
It's something about being
the firstborn of multiples.

00:20:12.130 --> 00:20:14.034
Yeah.

00:20:14.034 --> 00:20:15.936
[INAUDIBLE] firstborns
are expected

00:20:15.936 --> 00:20:19.720
to kind of like [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:24.140
OK, so pressure on the
firstborns to be first born.

00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:26.420
How would that raise IQ?

00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:30.476
Um-- all right, just
kind of like-- kind

00:20:30.476 --> 00:20:32.076
of like responsibility
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:20:38.890 --> 00:20:41.200
OK, so that's one of
the models out there.

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:44.210
A variant on that
is, firstborns get

00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:47.130
pushed into a tutoring
position, early on.

00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:49.020
And the well-known fact
that occasionally now

00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:50.436
within teaching
something actually

00:20:50.436 --> 00:20:52.420
causes you to know what
you're talking about.

00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:55.490
So the firstborns, because
of this tutoring role-- oh,

00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:57.430
that would control
for the single child

00:20:57.430 --> 00:21:00.090
versus the firstborn
difference, there.

00:21:00.090 --> 00:21:02.160
So maybe it's a
tutoring phenomenon.

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:04.030
What else could be happening?

00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:05.520
What other possible notions?

00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:06.440
Yeah.

00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:10.152
It depends what age you're
looking at the kids at.

00:21:10.152 --> 00:21:12.532
Because if you're looking
at, like, actual children

00:21:12.532 --> 00:21:14.436
and comparing IQs,
older children

00:21:14.436 --> 00:21:18.203
will probably have higher IQs
because they've had longer time

00:21:18.203 --> 00:21:19.750
in life to learn.

00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:20.530
OK.

00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:22.010
Great idea.

00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:25.580
Up to age 12,
latter-borns tend to have

00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:27.990
higher IQ than firstborns.

00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:31.800
By age 18, which is when
this study was carried out,

00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:33.590
it flips the other way around.

00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:36.970
So, any hypotheses for why
this difference occurs?

00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:39.880
Why, by 12 years of
age, latter-borns

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:42.220
tend to have higher
IQs than firstborns?

00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:44.360
Why does that then
flip afterward?

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:45.666
Yeah.

00:21:45.666 --> 00:21:46.166
[INAUDIBLE]

00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:53.640
OK, so is it IQ testing--
some biases with that.

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:55.430
What would rule
against that, though,

00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:58.280
is that the age
controlling for only

00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:01.590
childs-- only children--
versus firstborns.

00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:03.340
So that would definitely
be a possibility.

00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:04.578
That was ruled out.

00:22:04.578 --> 00:22:05.554
Yeah.

00:22:05.554 --> 00:22:07.606
I think that I [INAUDIBLE]
in another class

00:22:07.606 --> 00:22:09.731
that you said it had to do
with the ratio of adults

00:22:09.731 --> 00:22:11.950
in the environment when
the kids were growing up.

00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:13.675
So when there's
only one child, you

00:22:13.675 --> 00:22:18.361
have more adults with higher
language skills, and--

00:22:18.361 --> 00:22:18.860
Good.

00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:23.440
OK, so another version of a
parental-investment model,

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:26.380
there, which is, the fewer
the children, the more

00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:27.440
parental energy.

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:30.140
So, again, that's one of the
standard things in the field.

00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:32.670
They ruled that out with
comparing the only children

00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:34.506
versus firstborn child.

00:22:34.506 --> 00:22:36.380
So that's been a dominant
model in the field,

00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:38.119
so they had good
data against that.

00:22:38.119 --> 00:22:38.618
Yeah.

00:22:38.618 --> 00:22:40.312
Could it be the
age of the mother

00:22:40.312 --> 00:22:42.240
when the baby is a fetus?

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:43.130
Oh, OK!

00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:44.438
What's your idea about that?

00:22:44.438 --> 00:22:47.066
Well, younger mothers--
maybe the fetal environment

00:22:47.066 --> 00:22:48.842
is better, and
obviously older children

00:22:48.842 --> 00:22:51.510
have younger mothers than their
siblings whose-- the mother

00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:53.010
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:22:53.010 --> 00:22:55.690
OK, so we've got an
intrauterine effect.

00:22:55.690 --> 00:22:59.830
So we've got egg quality and
age of mom and all of that.

00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:02.520
They controlled for that--
the age of the mother.

00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:06.140
Can anybody think of something--
another intrauterine mechanism,

00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:08.380
though-- for what's the
difference between being

00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:11.830
the first fetus
who hits the womb

00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:14.960
of your mother versus being
the second or third or fourth?

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:17.381
What's one of the biological
things that might happen?

00:23:17.381 --> 00:23:17.880
Yeah.

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:18.660
Stress levels.

00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:19.493
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:24.320
OK, stress levels, which is
a way of stating something

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:25.890
about intrauterine environment.

00:23:25.890 --> 00:23:28.260
The more times you've
done this, perhaps more

00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:29.811
stressed you are in there.

00:23:29.811 --> 00:23:31.810
What else could biologically--
that's definitely

00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:32.559
one of the things.

00:23:32.559 --> 00:23:35.510
What else biologically
can happen, over time?

00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:37.790
Remember progesterone,
the other day,

00:23:37.790 --> 00:23:41.700
from that lecture of
making new if-then clauses

00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:43.399
and glucocorticoids.

00:23:43.399 --> 00:23:44.690
And this is a bit of a stretch.

00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:50.370
This takes some sort of fair
amount of OB/GYN knowledge.

00:23:50.370 --> 00:23:53.160
What's a danger as you have
more and more pregnancies,

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:56.241
in terms of your immune system?

00:23:56.241 --> 00:23:58.230
[INAUDIBLE]

00:23:58.230 --> 00:24:00.700
Yeah-- wait-- I
heard that mumbled!

00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:01.200
Sure!

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:02.140
It gets surpressed?

00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:02.720
Yeah.

00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:04.300
OK, immune suppression.

00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:06.270
So mom could be getting
a lot less healthy,

00:24:06.270 --> 00:24:08.880
which is another version of
tapping into that notion,

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:11.437
there, in terms of
egg quality with age.

00:24:11.437 --> 00:24:14.020
Separate of age, the number of
times you've gone through this.

00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:16.790
What could be another
possibility, immunologically,

00:24:16.790 --> 00:24:18.060
with repeated pregnancies?

00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:19.480
Yeah?

00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:24.490
A mother [INAUDIBLE] more,
like, form antigens [INAUDIBLE]?

00:24:24.490 --> 00:24:28.280
OK, despite that immune
suppression, on the average,

00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:30.940
with later pregnancies you
have a greater likelihood

00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:34.270
of having formed antibodies
against aspects of the fetus.

00:24:34.270 --> 00:24:36.170
They controlled for that.

00:24:36.170 --> 00:24:40.250
They showed, if you
were second-born

00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:43.410
and there were kids after
that-- if you were second-born

00:24:43.410 --> 00:24:48.810
and the firstborn died, you
reverted to the firstborn IQ.

00:24:48.810 --> 00:24:50.890
Showing that it was
not anything about,

00:24:50.890 --> 00:24:53.859
oh, you were the second fetus
in there, with more antibodies.

00:24:53.859 --> 00:24:54.900
They controlled for that.

00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:57.410
That's actually one of the
ideas they brought up in there.

00:24:57.410 --> 00:24:58.600
What else?

00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:00.620
How about that business
about up to age 12,

00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:02.210
the second-born does better?

00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:04.700
After that, by age 18,
the firstborn does better.

00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:05.841
Any theories with that?

00:25:05.841 --> 00:25:06.340
Yeah.

00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:08.805
Did it have to do, maybe,
with how fast they grow,

00:25:08.805 --> 00:25:09.346
or something?

00:25:09.346 --> 00:25:12.030
I know we talked about
how for fathers it's,

00:25:12.030 --> 00:25:16.449
like, a child grows
faster [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:16.449 --> 00:25:18.613
more later [INAUDIBLE]
grow faster then

00:25:18.613 --> 00:25:21.750
that takes a toll on
your [INAUDIBLE] health?

00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:24.980
OK, so an early advantage,
and you pay for it later,

00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:25.490
type deal.

00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:26.860
So that's a possibility.

00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:27.960
What else could come in?

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:30.250
Think about-- back
to the idea, there,

00:25:30.250 --> 00:25:31.810
about if you're a firstborn.

00:25:31.810 --> 00:25:34.320
Some of the firstborn
responsibility stuff.

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:37.250
How that plays out in
family dynamics early on.

00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:39.290
Why are the second-borns
doing better

00:25:39.290 --> 00:25:40.900
in the first dozen years?

00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:42.570
Why is it reversed later on?

00:25:42.570 --> 00:25:43.953
More ideas about that.

00:25:43.953 --> 00:25:45.223
Yeah.

00:25:45.223 --> 00:25:48.535
The second-born benefits
from the tutelage

00:25:48.535 --> 00:25:50.220
of the firstborn early in life.

00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:54.144
But later on, having the
older having had that

00:25:54.144 --> 00:25:56.390
experience of being more
responsible [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:00.260
Exactly.

00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:01.700
That's one of the main theories.

00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:03.930
That's probably the
predominant one proposed

00:26:03.930 --> 00:26:06.650
to explain that age switch.

00:26:06.650 --> 00:26:09.190
You get the second kid
show up, and suddenly you

00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:12.110
have a neotenized,
dumbed-down environment,

00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:13.740
where suddenly
the 8-year-old kid

00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:16.670
is watching Tinky Winky again
for the first time in six

00:26:16.670 --> 00:26:17.310
years.

00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:20.380
That it's an environment
that's then dominated more

00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:22.450
by having a younger one around.

00:26:22.450 --> 00:26:25.380
And what the older one is
mostly doing is the tutoring.

00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:28.040
And it takes a number of years
for the advantages of that

00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:29.310
to finally come through.

00:26:29.310 --> 00:26:32.120
That's the main model
that's given for that.

00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:33.480
Any other ideas?

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:35.900
How about
parental-resource stuff?

00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:39.200
The fact that the larger
the family, on the average,

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:43.320
in westernized countries, the
lower the socioeconomic status?

00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:44.290
Run with that one.

00:26:44.290 --> 00:26:45.510
Where does that fit in?

00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:50.130
What else?

00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:51.411
What else could be
happening with that?

00:26:51.411 --> 00:26:51.911
Yeah.

00:26:51.911 --> 00:26:54.551
If the socioeconomic status
of the family is lower,

00:26:54.551 --> 00:26:56.728
then wouldn't that suggest
that the children might

00:26:56.728 --> 00:27:00.206
bear more burden, in some
respects, with more children

00:27:00.206 --> 00:27:02.206
around, so that they had
to grow up more quickly

00:27:02.206 --> 00:27:05.890
and be exposed to
the real world?

00:27:05.890 --> 00:27:08.710
It's the later ones who are
out hunting squirrels and not

00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:10.260
getting the violin lessons.

00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:13.760
That's another version of the
parental-resource one, one

00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:16.370
being because there's a
smaller ratio of parents

00:27:16.370 --> 00:27:19.120
to the kids, the other being
because the more kids, the more

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:21.765
expensive for the
same parental income.

00:27:21.765 --> 00:27:24.070
And you have got less
to spread to each child.

00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:27.450
So they controlled for that,
looking at within family

00:27:27.450 --> 00:27:29.370
rather than just between family.

00:27:29.370 --> 00:27:30.715
They covered all of this.

00:27:30.715 --> 00:27:33.660
This is going to be
the definitive study

00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:36.290
for the rest of all of
time, showing what's

00:27:36.290 --> 00:27:40.160
going on with IQ by birth
order in 18-year-olds in Norway

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:42.460
in 2007.

00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:46.420
What was the magnitude of the
difference for this study?

00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:51.580
2.3 IQ points.

00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:54.410
And thus, coming
back to what could

00:27:54.410 --> 00:27:56.530
have been the very first
question sitting there

00:27:56.530 --> 00:27:58.360
when these guys were
ready to announce this

00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:02.200
to the world and
sort of start selling

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:05.430
their "be like a firstborn
IQ" self-help books and all

00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:06.180
of that.

00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:09.070
Lost in there-- and this was
picked up all over the press

00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:12.120
and, like, no doubt, endless
snotty comments by David

00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:13.320
Letterman or--

00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:17.660
And nobody-- 2.3 IQ points!

00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:20.170
You sneeze while you're
taking an IQ test

00:28:20.170 --> 00:28:22.710
and have to wipe your nose
for eight seconds afterward,

00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:26.040
and that's going to cost you
2.3 IQ points, because you

00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:27.780
get distracted for a second.

00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:31.870
An amazing example of this
whole business of-- yes,

00:28:31.870 --> 00:28:35.130
impeccable science that these
people did-- phenomenal!

00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:37.590
I don't know who possibly
gave them the money

00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:39.090
to do a study like this.

00:28:39.090 --> 00:28:41.450
And at the end of the
day, totally cool,

00:28:41.450 --> 00:28:45.580
irrefutable, statistically
totally reliable--

00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:49.367
which is very different
from saying "important."

00:28:49.367 --> 00:28:50.950
But what you get at
the end of the day

00:28:50.950 --> 00:28:54.750
was this mammoth study
producing 2.3 difference.

00:28:54.750 --> 00:28:57.040
And this is a great
demonstration.

00:28:57.040 --> 00:29:00.070
The difference between
how solid the science

00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:03.660
is, how confident you are
of the finding-- which

00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:07.280
takes in all the variables of
sample size and objectivity--

00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:09.790
how confident you
are of the finding,

00:29:09.790 --> 00:29:12.320
and how big of a finding it is.

00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:14.730
And those could be two
entire differences.

00:29:14.730 --> 00:29:16.730
So, as a [INAUDIBLE] you
to all the stuff that's

00:29:16.730 --> 00:29:19.150
going to come in the second
half of the course, one

00:29:19.150 --> 00:29:21.530
of the next tools you
have to have in mind,

00:29:21.530 --> 00:29:23.670
in addition to all the
ones that were apparent

00:29:23.670 --> 00:29:26.280
here in the questions you
were asking-- another one

00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:29.530
is to keep saying, well,
is this a big effect?

00:29:29.530 --> 00:29:31.630
"Is this a reliable
effect?" is different

00:29:31.630 --> 00:29:35.130
from "Is this a big effect?"
"Is this a consequential one?"

00:29:35.130 --> 00:29:37.370
So, another tool
to have in hand.

00:29:37.370 --> 00:29:39.950
So, with that in hand, go
and tell everybody tonight

00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:41.060
about Chutes and Ladders.

00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:41.560
OK.

00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:43.805
So what we jump to
now is something

00:29:43.805 --> 00:29:46.180
that's been running through
a whole bunch of the lectures

00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:47.280
already.

00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:50.070
OK, we've got all those
evolutionary models

00:29:50.070 --> 00:29:53.240
of individual selection and
kin selection and in-group

00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:54.100
and out-group.

00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:56.680
And we've got something
about the molecular biology

00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:59.710
of why it is that you
share 50% of your genes

00:29:59.710 --> 00:30:03.007
with this relative and 25 and
12 and a half, and all of that.

00:30:03.007 --> 00:30:05.090
And somewhere in there,
lurking through all of it,

00:30:05.090 --> 00:30:06.630
is a question
which is what we'll

00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:10.710
focus on now, which is, how
do organisms, how do animals,

00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:13.910
how do individuals
recognize relatives?

00:30:13.910 --> 00:30:17.650
Because you can't do any of
that evolutionary-biology,

00:30:17.650 --> 00:30:21.080
kin-selection-theory stuff,
where it's all predicated

00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:24.650
on degree of relatedness,
unless you know how related

00:30:24.650 --> 00:30:26.510
am I with this individual.

00:30:26.510 --> 00:30:29.780
So what we're going to be
looking at, here, is, why--

00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:33.740
or how-- sure, let's go for
"how" instead of "why"--

00:30:33.740 --> 00:30:38.000
how do animals, how do social
animals, recognize kin?

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.027
What's clear is, it does not
take a very fancy organism.

00:30:42.027 --> 00:30:43.610
And there was a great
example of this,

00:30:43.610 --> 00:30:46.026
which I think I stuck in the
extended notes, last minute--

00:30:46.026 --> 00:30:50.680
a paper published just a couple
weeks ago looking at deer mice.

00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:53.620
Deer mice, and much like
their vole cousins--

00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:56.570
if they are cousins--
some deer-mice strains are

00:30:56.570 --> 00:30:58.642
monogamous, and
some are polygamous.

00:30:58.642 --> 00:31:00.100
This appears to be
a frequent theme

00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:01.770
in these little rodent things.

00:31:01.770 --> 00:31:04.020
And with the deer
mice, what you find

00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:07.310
is, with the polygamous
ones one female mates

00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:08.420
with a bunch of males.

00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:10.420
And as a result,
one female will have

00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:13.970
sperm from a number of different
males afterward in the vagina.

00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:16.580
And what you get
is, evolutionarily,

00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:20.000
from all the rules we learned
by now, perfectly logically,

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.460
you get intrasexual
competition between the sperm

00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:25.990
from the different males.

00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:27.610
We already heard
a version of that

00:31:27.610 --> 00:31:29.400
with the flies,
back the other week,

00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:31.630
there, where the
sperm of one releases

00:31:31.630 --> 00:31:34.140
toxins that kill the other
sperm but in the process could

00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:36.530
damage the female's
future-- all of that.

00:31:36.530 --> 00:31:39.500
This is a theme that runs
through a lot of the literature

00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:41.270
on sexual competition.

00:31:41.270 --> 00:31:42.442
Sperm competition.

00:31:42.442 --> 00:31:44.400
And there's even hints
that something like that

00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:45.310
goes on in humans.

00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:45.810
OK.

00:31:45.810 --> 00:31:47.890
So what form does it take?

00:31:47.890 --> 00:31:50.430
In these deer mice, as follows.

00:31:50.430 --> 00:31:54.370
I don't begin to understand
the mechanics of this,

00:31:54.370 --> 00:31:55.540
nor do I want to.

00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:58.560
But apparently, with
deer-mice sperm,

00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:00.830
if they all clump
together-- you know,

00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:03.440
many hands on the
oars, or something.

00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:06.950
If they all clump together,
you get this macro sperm thing

00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:09.910
which swims upstream faster.

00:32:09.910 --> 00:32:12.000
And the paper had
all sorts of diagrams

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.750
of this which I did not want
to look at in much detail.

00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:15.770
But there's this--

00:32:15.770 --> 00:32:19.370
So you've got-- with
the polygamous strains,

00:32:19.370 --> 00:32:20.520
you've got this problem.

00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:23.570
If your sperm want to do
things absolutely correctly,

00:32:23.570 --> 00:32:26.580
they only want to form
one of these big-old,

00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:30.680
you know, pleasure-boat
aggregate crew things,

00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:34.700
with sperm from themselves--
with sperm from only

00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:35.510
themselves.

00:32:35.510 --> 00:32:38.310
And, following all
of our theorizing,

00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:42.280
to a lesser extent with close
relatives and not at all with

00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:44.420
sperm from some other guy.

00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:47.470
And that's precisely what
they showed in this paper.

00:32:47.470 --> 00:32:50.730
You take sperm from
monogamous strains,

00:32:50.730 --> 00:32:52.730
and you put sperm from
different males together,

00:32:52.730 --> 00:32:56.290
and they all happily form this
big cooperative clump of sperm,

00:32:56.290 --> 00:32:56.790
there.

00:32:56.790 --> 00:32:58.610
But you take them
from species that

00:32:58.610 --> 00:33:02.500
have evolved under the
selective pressure of polygamy,

00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:06.050
and the sperm there know
who they're related to

00:33:06.050 --> 00:33:10.170
and will form these clumps only
with the ones from themselves.

00:33:10.170 --> 00:33:14.180
You can immediately design all
sorts of lock-and-key stories

00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:15.430
for how it's pulled off.

00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:18.690
You could immediately come
up with some approximation

00:33:18.690 --> 00:33:20.570
of what the molecular
mechanism would be.

00:33:20.570 --> 00:33:23.270
But for a first pass,
what's striking here is, oh,

00:33:23.270 --> 00:33:26.100
how do organisms
recognize relatives?

00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:28.300
There are, out
there, single cells

00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:31.290
that can do this under
exactly the evolutionary

00:33:31.290 --> 00:33:33.830
circumstances-- models
that we've got already.

00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:37.150
So, as we begin to look, now,
at how whole organisms do it,

00:33:37.150 --> 00:33:38.520
even cells can do it.

00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:41.950
And we're going to see lots of
different possible mechanisms.

00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:45.650
In lots of species, what you
have is some equivalent of what

00:33:45.650 --> 00:33:47.740
those single sperm
are doing, which is,

00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:51.680
there is innate
recognition of relatives.

00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:53.360
How do you show this?

00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:56.500
We already know the classic
ways of doing this, which is

00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:58.640
the crossed-fostering approach.

00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:02.650
You take a litter, newborn
litter, of your rodents,

00:34:02.650 --> 00:34:04.910
and you cross-foster
them to other females.

00:34:04.910 --> 00:34:06.860
And if, later on,
they can behaviorally

00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:10.828
differentiate between their
siblings and nonsiblings,

00:34:10.828 --> 00:34:12.244
there's something
innate about it.

00:34:12.244 --> 00:34:12.469
Oh!

00:34:12.469 --> 00:34:13.370
Wait a second, wait a second.

00:34:13.370 --> 00:34:14.810
What about prenatal environment?

00:34:14.810 --> 00:34:16.639
Wasn't there something
about-- so now you

00:34:16.639 --> 00:34:19.230
do the prenatal
cross-fostering--

00:34:19.230 --> 00:34:21.489
the fetal-transplant
approach-- and you get

00:34:21.489 --> 00:34:22.830
the exact same thing.

00:34:22.830 --> 00:34:26.159
There is innate
recognition of relatedness

00:34:26.159 --> 00:34:28.190
in all sorts of rodent species.

00:34:28.190 --> 00:34:30.449
Another way of doing
it even cleaner.

00:34:30.449 --> 00:34:36.150
You have two different litters
from the same mother and father

00:34:36.150 --> 00:34:37.080
rodent.

00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:38.570
And then they meet together.

00:34:38.570 --> 00:34:41.510
So there was no shared
prenatal environment.

00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:43.889
And you can show
recognition there.

00:34:43.889 --> 00:34:46.770
You put the rat, later
on, into the cage where

00:34:46.770 --> 00:34:49.380
there is the urine
of its sibling,

00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:51.280
and there is the urine
of a perfect stranger,

00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:54.260
and they will prefer
going to that one.

00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:56.840
You could show that it's
even more subtle than that.

00:34:56.840 --> 00:35:00.950
They will prefer to go to
the urine of a full sibling

00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:04.200
versus a half sibling, a half
sibling versus a first cousin--

00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:05.840
all the way on down.

00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:08.660
They could take it out to
about third or fourth cousins.

00:35:08.660 --> 00:35:12.270
Incredible discrimination,
there, that can go into it.

00:35:12.270 --> 00:35:15.620
And it has to be that way, or
else all of the theorizing from

00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:18.430
the other day-- you can't figure
out how to give up your life

00:35:18.430 --> 00:35:21.130
for two cousins or eight
brothers or eight brothers or--

00:35:21.130 --> 00:35:21.630
[FEEDBACK]

00:35:21.630 --> 00:35:23.480
--two cousins, or
whatever the math

00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:25.670
is, unless you know who's who.

00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:28.800
And in some species where it's
done entirely instinctually,

00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:31.100
that would be the way
you demonstrate it.

00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:34.120
So what's the mechanism,
, there, in those cases?

00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:36.960
The most-studied
ones are olfactory.

00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:38.870
Olfactory signatures.

00:35:38.870 --> 00:35:42.050
"Pheromones"-- we've already
heard that term in here.

00:35:42.050 --> 00:35:43.920
We're going to hear
tons more about it.

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:46.790
But pheromonal communication.

00:35:46.790 --> 00:35:49.300
What does that begin to require?

00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:52.950
If you have pheromones,
odorants, coming out of, say,

00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:54.940
the urine from
different individuals,

00:35:54.940 --> 00:35:57.840
telling you your degree
of relatedness to them,

00:35:57.840 --> 00:35:59.770
it requires two things.

00:35:59.770 --> 00:36:04.320
It requires qualitative
differences in the urine,

00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:07.920
reflecting the genetic makeup
of the individual who provided

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:09.670
that urine to the grad student.

00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:14.430
And it requires some mechanism,
some olfactory brain-processing

00:36:14.430 --> 00:36:18.670
mechanism, to be able to pick up
whatever those differences are.

00:36:18.670 --> 00:36:20.730
And both have been shown.

00:36:20.730 --> 00:36:21.680
OK.

00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:24.040
The way you begin to
get the differentiation

00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:27.760
at the end of how the
urine smells differently.

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:30.280
What you've got--
and referred to back

00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:33.080
with the transposable
stuff is-- you remember,

00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:36.560
in vertebrates you've got
some of your highest rates

00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:39.250
of transposable events
in your immune system,

00:36:39.250 --> 00:36:42.431
your genes devoted to immunity,
where you juggle them around.

00:36:42.431 --> 00:36:44.180
And that's how, with
any luck, you come up

00:36:44.180 --> 00:36:47.060
with an antibody that will
recognize this completely

00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:49.060
novel pathogen. All of that.

00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:51.240
There's an additional
stretch of genes

00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:54.310
in that neighborhood where
what happens with that is,

00:36:54.310 --> 00:36:58.520
it also undergoes huge amounts
of splicing and transposition

00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:00.220
and juggling and all of that.

00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:04.310
And what do you do then is,
you create a completely unique

00:37:04.310 --> 00:37:05.140
protein.

00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:07.930
You do it in enough
of a combinatorial way

00:37:07.930 --> 00:37:12.600
that it would take
statistically 400 quadrillion

00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:15.800
googleflex-whatevers to come
up with another organism

00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:19.470
with the exact same
protein signature.

00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:21.600
When you make a
protein from that,

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:24.800
you have made up one that no
other organism on earth has,

00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:27.580
with a very high
statistical reliability.

00:37:27.580 --> 00:37:29.790
This is a stretch
of genes called

00:37:29.790 --> 00:37:34.690
the "major histocompatibility
complex"-- MHCs.

00:37:34.690 --> 00:37:38.770
And what you see with those
is histocompatibility,

00:37:38.770 --> 00:37:41.150
that whole business with
organ transplants-- how

00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:45.220
compatible of a donor is
it, how closely related,

00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:48.150
how much of this--
jargon, for those of you

00:37:48.150 --> 00:37:51.390
who know it-- how much of a
shared antigenic determinant,

00:37:51.390 --> 00:37:55.752
how genetically similar is this
fingerprint, this identifying

00:37:55.752 --> 00:37:58.150
ID of a protein?

00:37:58.150 --> 00:38:01.490
That determines things
like histocompatibility--

00:38:01.490 --> 00:38:03.360
how well organ transfers work.

00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:05.020
That's the origins of the term.

00:38:05.020 --> 00:38:08.230
So every single one of us,
every single organism out there,

00:38:08.230 --> 00:38:11.720
has made an arguably unique
juggle of these genes

00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:14.170
and comes up with
this signature protein

00:38:14.170 --> 00:38:18.160
that it sticks on the surface of
every single one of its cells.

00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:19.810
What's that good for?

00:38:19.810 --> 00:38:22.140
That's good for
your immune system

00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:25.370
learning, if we run into a
cell with one of those things,

00:38:25.370 --> 00:38:26.230
it's us.

00:38:26.230 --> 00:38:27.340
Don't attack it.

00:38:27.340 --> 00:38:29.476
Don't form antibodies
against it.

00:38:29.476 --> 00:38:31.350
And if we run into
anything else in here that

00:38:31.350 --> 00:38:33.640
doesn't have one of those,
it's an invasive pathogen,

00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:34.830
and go attack it.

00:38:34.830 --> 00:38:39.260
This is the basis of the
self/nonself recognition

00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:41.340
ability of the immune system.

00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:44.110
And what autoimmune diseases
are is when your immune system

00:38:44.110 --> 00:38:48.410
screws up and begins to mistake
one of your signature proteins,

00:38:48.410 --> 00:38:50.980
your major
histocompatibility gene

00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:54.430
derived signature protein,
as, in fact, being invasive.

00:38:54.430 --> 00:38:57.010
And one of the other things
you hear about-- the other day,

00:38:57.010 --> 00:39:00.300
we heard about this tropical
parasite, trypanosome.

00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:02.550
What it does, as
you heard, was it

00:39:02.550 --> 00:39:04.890
keeps juggling its
surface proteins.

00:39:04.890 --> 00:39:07.940
So just as your immune system
is all set to attack it,

00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:10.160
because it's got
antibodies to recognize it,

00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:12.670
it has changed its
signature protein.

00:39:12.670 --> 00:39:15.590
There's another tropical
parasite, schistosomes,

00:39:15.590 --> 00:39:20.010
where what they do is they steal
your major histocompatibility

00:39:20.010 --> 00:39:22.750
proteins from the surface
of some of your cells

00:39:22.750 --> 00:39:24.450
and glue it on themselves.

00:39:24.450 --> 00:39:28.680
And they are wolves in a
sheep major histocompatibility

00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:30.370
proteins or some such things.

00:39:30.370 --> 00:39:35.720
So that's one major domain where
this unique protein-- derived

00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:38.370
from a unique gene--
unique protein signature

00:39:38.370 --> 00:39:40.730
lets your immune
system work properly.

00:39:40.730 --> 00:39:43.810
So it turns out there's another
whole domain with it, which

00:39:43.810 --> 00:39:47.240
is, these proteins
can become soluble.

00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:49.870
Which means they're no
longer anchored to a cell,

00:39:49.870 --> 00:39:51.340
they're just floating around.

00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:55.000
And ultimately they're
floating around in your saliva,

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:59.620
in your urine, in your armpit
exudates or whatever it is.

00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:02.860
And what they begin to do--
complicated mechanisms, which

00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:04.240
I think I will bypass.

00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:08.720
What they do is give a unique
signature to the pheromones

00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:10.290
coming off of you.

00:40:10.290 --> 00:40:12.110
And, as we will
see in the lectures

00:40:12.110 --> 00:40:15.520
to come, animals of all
sorts of species can tell,

00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:18.090
is this individual
of my species,

00:40:18.090 --> 00:40:20.140
are they the same gender,
are they an adult,

00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:22.420
are they sexually
mature, are they healthy,

00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:23.720
are they pregnant-- whatever.

00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:25.860
But thanks to this
major-histocompatibility

00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:30.410
business they can also
tell, is this a relative?

00:40:30.410 --> 00:40:33.250
Now the juggling of events,
the splicing and the juggling

00:40:33.250 --> 00:40:37.160
of the genes, has some degree
of statistical relatedness

00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:39.205
the more closely
related you are.

00:40:39.205 --> 00:40:42.940
In other words, you
smell your own urine--

00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:46.090
if that's your hobby-- and the
major histocompatibility genes

00:40:46.090 --> 00:40:49.830
in there will obviously
exactly match your own.

00:40:49.830 --> 00:40:51.970
You smell those of
a full sibling--

00:40:51.970 --> 00:40:54.590
even more questions to be
asked-- and you do that,

00:40:54.590 --> 00:40:58.140
and there will be a greater
degree, statistically,

00:40:58.140 --> 00:41:00.880
of similarity of the
structure of that protein

00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:04.040
than with a second cousin,
than with a perfect stranger,

00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:06.320
than with a Nepalese
if you're from Belgium.

00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:08.920
Whatever it is, what you
find in those cases is,

00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:12.550
that's how you not only
get innate olfactory

00:41:12.550 --> 00:41:14.950
recognition of, is
this a relative or not,

00:41:14.950 --> 00:41:17.630
but how related of a relative?

00:41:17.630 --> 00:41:18.890
So that's half of it.

00:41:18.890 --> 00:41:21.980
That's how you generate
the unique signature

00:41:21.980 --> 00:41:24.700
at the olfaction at
the pheromone end.

00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:27.260
The other trick is,
how do you generate

00:41:27.260 --> 00:41:31.010
an olfactory system that can
make that discrimination?

00:41:31.010 --> 00:41:34.690
And all we've got to go with, at
that point, is-- you can guess,

00:41:34.690 --> 00:41:36.440
if you think about
it a bit-- is,

00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:39.600
we've got to have some
version of olfactory receptors

00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:42.900
that do the old
lock-and-key business.

00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:48.120
Just as you make a protein
which has a certain shape,

00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:50.740
indicating that this is
your unique signature.

00:41:50.740 --> 00:41:52.600
What you want to do
is have receptors

00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:55.620
that will have the uniquely
complimentary shape

00:41:55.620 --> 00:41:58.730
for the lock and key so
that you can do a-- oh!

00:41:58.730 --> 00:42:00.400
This fits perfectly.

00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:03.330
Let's transduce this to a
signal to the brain, saying,

00:42:03.330 --> 00:42:05.820
I'm smelling my armpit.

00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:08.210
And if, instead, you've
got a protein that

00:42:08.210 --> 00:42:11.400
fits in there like a lock and
key but not quite as well,

00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:15.320
you send the message of, oh, I'm
smelling my sibling's armpit.

00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:18.330
And if it fits in there not
quite as well, and all the way

00:42:18.330 --> 00:42:22.200
down, you could begin to see
exactly how you designed this.

00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:26.040
If you've got 1,000 of these
receptors of this shape

00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:28.840
and every single one of them it
has them fitting in well enough

00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:32.460
to stay in there for three
seconds, so that all 1,000

00:42:32.460 --> 00:42:33.850
of them send the signal.

00:42:33.850 --> 00:42:35.670
It takes three seconds
of binding there

00:42:35.670 --> 00:42:37.210
to cause the signal to happen.

00:42:37.210 --> 00:42:40.360
All 1,000 of them send the
signal that means "it's me."

00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:43.650
It doesn't fit quite as well,
so, statistically, only 800

00:42:43.650 --> 00:42:46.860
of them stay in there for three
seconds, so 800 of the cells

00:42:46.860 --> 00:42:49.420
are reporting, oh,
that's a full sibling.

00:42:49.420 --> 00:42:51.290
I don't know if
that's the mechanism.

00:42:51.290 --> 00:42:53.390
But this would be a
way of constructing it.

00:42:53.390 --> 00:42:57.590
That's exactly how it could
be, along the lines of lock

00:42:57.590 --> 00:43:00.990
and key, genes produce
proteins of certain shapes,

00:43:00.990 --> 00:43:02.640
certain functions-- all of that.

00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:04.470
And that's how you
begin to do it.

00:43:04.470 --> 00:43:06.560
What have we just gotten?

00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:10.000
We've gotten a protein--
a molecular basis

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:14.030
of our theorizing, the other
day, of an if/then clause.

00:43:14.030 --> 00:43:17.460
If and only if this
is a close relative,

00:43:17.460 --> 00:43:22.590
then send a message to the
neurons that do "cooperation."

00:43:22.590 --> 00:43:24.010
We already know
that's gibberish,

00:43:24.010 --> 00:43:26.350
to say that there's neurons
that do cooperation.

00:43:26.350 --> 00:43:29.740
But you could begin to see
how this is going to work.

00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:33.630
This is the "if" part of
all the conditional if/then

00:43:33.630 --> 00:43:36.850
clauses built around
degree of relatedness.

00:43:36.850 --> 00:43:38.970
So how does your
olfactory bulb do this?

00:43:38.970 --> 00:43:41.040
Very interestingly,
people are beginning

00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:44.220
to get a sense of two hormones
that are relevant to this.

00:43:44.220 --> 00:43:47.100
One is called
"oxytocin," and the other

00:43:47.100 --> 00:43:49.420
is called "vasopressin."

00:43:49.420 --> 00:43:52.830
And what we will see in lectures
to come is, particularly

00:43:52.830 --> 00:43:55.360
in females, oxytocin
has long been

00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:59.700
known to play some, like,
plumbing, nuts-and-bolts job

00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:04.210
in giving birth, and vasopressin
in uterine contractions.

00:44:04.210 --> 00:44:07.800
And take your average, like,
off-the-rack endocrinologist.

00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:09.320
And what these
hormones are about

00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:13.530
is, like, your uterus
contracting and giving birth.

00:44:13.530 --> 00:44:15.990
But oh, that's so
little of what they do.

00:44:15.990 --> 00:44:18.740
What they're much more
interestingly involved with

00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:20.200
is what happens next.

00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:22.320
Which is now
beginning to learn how

00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:25.750
to recognize the smell
of the individual

00:44:25.750 --> 00:44:27.450
you just gave birth to.

00:44:27.450 --> 00:44:31.280
Because it turns out, what
oxytocin and vasopressin do

00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:34.100
in the olfactory bulbs--
the olfactory system,

00:44:34.100 --> 00:44:36.890
the olfactory equivalent
of your eyes and ears--

00:44:36.890 --> 00:44:40.660
is they tune up the
cells that recognize

00:44:40.660 --> 00:44:43.360
major histocompatibility
signals.

00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:46.700
They make them attuned to,
is this a relative or not?

00:44:46.700 --> 00:44:48.550
And there's an if/then clause.

00:44:48.550 --> 00:44:51.910
If the levels of this hormone
have the certain high levels

00:44:51.910 --> 00:44:54.910
indicating that I
just gave birth,

00:44:54.910 --> 00:44:58.680
and I smell something whose
signature odorants fit really

00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:01.070
well to this
receptor, then this is

00:45:01.070 --> 00:45:03.750
someone who I'm going to nurse
like crazy, unless it turns out

00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:05.440
to be my mother or grandmother.

00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:08.610
OK, let's put it another-- if
they're very little and cutesy

00:45:08.610 --> 00:45:10.280
and make cute little
mewling sounds,

00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:13.125
then I will take care
of them and nurse them

00:45:13.125 --> 00:45:14.440
and all that sort of thing.

00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:17.890
And it's turning out that that's
what oxytocin and vasopressin

00:45:17.890 --> 00:45:18.760
are doing in there.

00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:22.260
You generate mice with
genetically-- knocking out

00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:25.650
oxytocin or vasopressin
or their receptors--

00:45:25.650 --> 00:45:28.380
if these are totally new terms,
this will come by the week

00:45:28.380 --> 00:45:30.420
after next, as an introduction.

00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:33.150
You knock out those
genes, and you get what

00:45:33.150 --> 00:45:36.130
is called a "social anosmia."

00:45:36.130 --> 00:45:38.730
Anosmia is the inability
to smell something.

00:45:38.730 --> 00:45:42.200
A social anosmia is, your
nose is working just fine--

00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:44.580
if you're a rat, you could
discriminate different food

00:45:44.580 --> 00:45:47.460
types-- completely
arbitrary odors-- you just

00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:50.290
can't distinguish
between individuals.

00:45:50.290 --> 00:45:52.380
And there was a paper,
a couple of weeks ago,

00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:55.130
showing for the first time--
what the model has always been

00:45:55.130 --> 00:45:58.340
is that circulating
oxytocin and vasopressin

00:45:58.340 --> 00:46:00.940
get into your olfactory
system and have those effects.

00:46:00.940 --> 00:46:03.120
What this paper showed
for the first time is,

00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:06.330
you're making those hormones
right in your nostrils,

00:46:06.330 --> 00:46:07.380
to begin with.

00:46:07.380 --> 00:46:09.270
This is what tunes it up.

00:46:09.270 --> 00:46:11.780
Very interestingly,
there is also

00:46:11.780 --> 00:46:15.960
a literature emerging
suggesting mutations

00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:18.950
in genes relevant to
oxytocin and vasopressin

00:46:18.950 --> 00:46:22.800
in families with a high
incidence of autism.

00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:27.170
Autism, a disease where-- one
way of characterizing it is,

00:46:27.170 --> 00:46:30.940
there are enormous deficits
in normal socialization

00:46:30.940 --> 00:46:34.620
interaction, social
bonding, social affiliation.

00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:37.740
And this suggests that has
something to do with it.

00:46:37.740 --> 00:46:39.510
OK, so that's a first mechanism.

00:46:39.510 --> 00:46:41.340
That's how it might
work innately.

00:46:41.340 --> 00:46:46.570
Very cool study in recent years,
also showing one facet of this.

00:46:46.570 --> 00:46:49.610
One of the things you get
taught in Intro Neuro--

00:46:49.610 --> 00:46:52.690
if you've taken anytime
in the last 5,000 years--

00:46:52.690 --> 00:46:54.760
is, when you've
got an adult brain,

00:46:54.760 --> 00:46:56.684
it doesn't make
any more neurons.

00:46:56.684 --> 00:46:58.850
You've got all the neurons
you're ever going to get,

00:46:58.850 --> 00:47:00.308
by the time you're
three years old,

00:47:00.308 --> 00:47:03.830
and all you can do thereafter
is squander them away on, like,

00:47:03.830 --> 00:47:06.320
stupid weekend
binges or whatever.

00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:09.250
And it turns out that,
nonetheless, this is not true.

00:47:09.250 --> 00:47:12.110
And arguably this is the biggest
revolution in neuroscience

00:47:12.110 --> 00:47:13.540
in the last decade or so.

00:47:13.540 --> 00:47:16.070
Adult "neurogenesis."

00:47:16.070 --> 00:47:18.260
And it turns out, this
adult neurogenesis

00:47:18.260 --> 00:47:20.690
happens in only two
areas in the brain.

00:47:20.690 --> 00:47:23.310
The first one is
really interesting.

00:47:23.310 --> 00:47:26.550
Because it's this part of the
brain called the "hippocampus."

00:47:26.550 --> 00:47:29.460
Hippocampus-- learning, memory.

00:47:29.460 --> 00:47:31.290
It's totally cool.

00:47:31.290 --> 00:47:33.550
And a gazillion studies
now showing stuff

00:47:33.550 --> 00:47:37.510
like, you learn a new fact,
you stimulate neurogenesis

00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:38.690
in your hippocampus.

00:47:38.690 --> 00:47:41.050
You get put in an
enriched environment,

00:47:41.050 --> 00:47:43.430
you exercise, you do
all sorts of stuff--

00:47:43.430 --> 00:47:45.210
you make new neurons there.

00:47:45.210 --> 00:47:48.570
You get stressed, you make
less new neurons there.

00:47:48.570 --> 00:47:50.320
This whole new field.

00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:54.610
And 99% of the studies have
been about these populations

00:47:54.610 --> 00:47:57.400
of neural stem cells
in the hippocampus.

00:47:57.400 --> 00:48:00.980
Totally ignored has been
the second, little pocket

00:48:00.980 --> 00:48:03.530
of these neural stem cells
that can make new neurons.

00:48:03.530 --> 00:48:04.940
Nobody's interested in it.

00:48:04.940 --> 00:48:05.790
What's this about?

00:48:05.790 --> 00:48:06.760
It's totally boring.

00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:08.420
Where's the second pocket?

00:48:08.420 --> 00:48:11.810
Just behind the olfactory bulb.

00:48:11.810 --> 00:48:14.620
And what this study showed--
and this is one in your reader,

00:48:14.620 --> 00:48:15.700
just at the abstract.

00:48:15.700 --> 00:48:18.510
What it showed was, if
you have a rat right

00:48:18.510 --> 00:48:20.440
around the time
she gets pregnant,

00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:23.660
she starts to make a new
neurons out the wazoo--

00:48:23.660 --> 00:48:26.190
not from the exciting
hippocampal pocket,

00:48:26.190 --> 00:48:28.400
but from this boring,
little olfactory.

00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:31.360
And what goes on with
the onset of pregnancy--

00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:34.780
female rodents do this
massive renovation

00:48:34.780 --> 00:48:38.240
job of all their olfactory
neurons going on, there.

00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:40.060
What it is, they
showed in this study--

00:48:40.060 --> 00:48:42.450
it is driven by the
prolactin levels that

00:48:42.450 --> 00:48:44.020
rise during pregnancy.

00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:45.530
And what have you got there?

00:48:45.530 --> 00:48:47.410
What they showed was,
right around the time

00:48:47.410 --> 00:48:51.870
she gives birth, she's got
this spanking-new, completely

00:48:51.870 --> 00:48:55.060
renovated olfactory
system, just in time

00:48:55.060 --> 00:48:57.990
to do one of the most important
olfactory things of her life,

00:48:57.990 --> 00:49:01.610
which is quickly figure out
which ones are her babies.

00:49:01.610 --> 00:49:04.379
To quickly do the
social bonding to them.

00:49:04.379 --> 00:49:05.920
What hasn't been
tested yet, but what

00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:09.520
I guarantee has to be there, is
that vasopressin and oxytocin

00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:11.900
has to have some sort of
role going on in there.

00:49:11.900 --> 00:49:13.412
Really interesting.

00:49:13.412 --> 00:49:15.060
Interesting implication of this.

00:49:15.060 --> 00:49:16.150
So think about this.

00:49:16.150 --> 00:49:19.080
If you were pregnant-- and
assuming this works in mammals

00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:21.750
other than rodents-- and
if you were pregnant--

00:49:21.750 --> 00:49:24.140
so the whole time you were
pregnant, what's going on?

00:49:24.140 --> 00:49:27.060
You're doing this huge
job of ripping out

00:49:27.060 --> 00:49:31.670
the walls and the plumbing in
your olfactory bulb and, like,

00:49:31.670 --> 00:49:32.680
putting in new stuff.

00:49:32.680 --> 00:49:33.890
And it's a total mess.

00:49:33.890 --> 00:49:36.540
Like, you spend your pregnancy
with your olfactory system

00:49:36.540 --> 00:49:38.250
totally cockeyed.

00:49:38.250 --> 00:49:42.180
No wonder stuff smells
weird, and no wonder foods

00:49:42.180 --> 00:49:44.090
taste weird and all of that.

00:49:44.090 --> 00:49:46.510
There is a whole
adaptationist literature

00:49:46.510 --> 00:49:49.200
out there on, why should
it be that you suddenly

00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:51.880
want pickles and these foods
you can't stand the taste of?

00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:54.760
And it's to avoid
inadvertently eating toxins.

00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:57.670
A really unconvincing,
spandrel-filled

00:49:57.670 --> 00:49:58.970
literature out there.

00:49:58.970 --> 00:50:02.670
It may be an inadvertent
spandrel byproduct of,

00:50:02.670 --> 00:50:04.670
you're ripping apart the
whole olfactory system,

00:50:04.670 --> 00:50:07.500
so you're all set to recognize
the smell of your kids.

00:50:07.500 --> 00:50:09.950
You just got screwy
olfaction and taste

00:50:09.950 --> 00:50:11.730
all throughout pregnancy.

00:50:11.730 --> 00:50:13.630
The main point of
this, though, is,

00:50:13.630 --> 00:50:16.530
this is endocrine
regulation driving,

00:50:16.530 --> 00:50:19.180
not to make you
able to recognize

00:50:19.180 --> 00:50:22.140
a relative-- because you've
already got the genes in place

00:50:22.140 --> 00:50:25.060
for that-- just making sure
that your olfactory bulb is

00:50:25.060 --> 00:50:29.140
at the very best at
that time for doing it.

00:50:29.140 --> 00:50:30.160
OK.

00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:32.350
What else does one want
to know about that?

00:50:32.350 --> 00:50:35.810
OK, one additional thing you
could do with that information.

00:50:35.810 --> 00:50:37.550
Which is, OK, so,
why do you want

00:50:37.550 --> 00:50:38.990
to know who your relatives are?

00:50:38.990 --> 00:50:40.940
It's who you mate with,
it's who you cooperate

00:50:40.940 --> 00:50:42.490
with, it's who you
try to kill, it's

00:50:42.490 --> 00:50:44.823
who you take care of, it's
who-- all that sort of thing.

00:50:44.823 --> 00:50:46.050
All of these domains.

00:50:46.050 --> 00:50:49.410
Also it's who you pay
attention to socially,

00:50:49.410 --> 00:50:51.406
in terms of gossip and such.

00:50:51.406 --> 00:50:54.620
One interesting
study that was shown,

00:50:54.620 --> 00:50:56.952
which was with
baboons-- and this

00:50:56.952 --> 00:50:59.160
was the same folks at the
University of Pennsylvania.

00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:02.460
What they did was they
recorded the voices--

00:51:02.460 --> 00:51:04.160
You notice this
business about playing

00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:06.090
the voices of some
animal in the bushes

00:51:06.090 --> 00:51:08.120
and looking at the
response in everybody else

00:51:08.120 --> 00:51:09.830
is one of these standard tools.

00:51:09.830 --> 00:51:11.720
What they did, in
this case, was,

00:51:11.720 --> 00:51:15.480
the voice of two animals from
that group, from that troop.

00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:20.400
And what we heard was the voice
of the lower-ranking animal

00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:23.410
giving a dominating
vocalization,

00:51:23.410 --> 00:51:25.990
and the voice of the
lower-ranking individual

00:51:25.990 --> 00:51:29.584
giving this terrified
subordinating noise.

00:51:29.584 --> 00:51:31.500
So they obviously were
not getting a terrified

00:51:31.500 --> 00:51:33.230
subordinating noise
out of number 1,

00:51:33.230 --> 00:51:35.510
but they had to sit
around and get recordings

00:51:35.510 --> 00:51:38.070
of number 2 and everybody
else, at some point or other,

00:51:38.070 --> 00:51:39.750
so now they could
put them down there.

00:51:39.750 --> 00:51:41.030
And they would play this.

00:51:41.030 --> 00:51:43.760
So everybody else is sitting
there and saying, what?

00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:46.800
Number 4 is terrified
of number 27?

00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:47.910
What's going on?

00:51:47.910 --> 00:51:51.400
And what they showed was,
everybody paid a huge attention

00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:55.150
to this, if they were hearing--
number 27 was trashing number

00:51:55.150 --> 00:51:57.090
4 if they weren't relatives.

00:51:57.090 --> 00:51:59.240
But if they were
in the same family,

00:51:59.240 --> 00:52:03.500
and there was this dominance
reversal nobody paid attention.

00:52:03.500 --> 00:52:04.840
Crazy relatives.

00:52:04.840 --> 00:52:06.680
Who knows what's going
on in that family?

00:52:06.680 --> 00:52:07.860
They're just squabbling.

00:52:07.860 --> 00:52:10.480
They distinguish the
social implications

00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:12.800
of a dominance
reversal, depending

00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:15.110
on relatedness or not.

00:52:15.110 --> 00:52:16.980
One additional thing
with it, before we

00:52:16.980 --> 00:52:19.290
go to our next way of
recognizing relatives,

00:52:19.290 --> 00:52:21.780
after the break-- hold on.

00:52:21.780 --> 00:52:23.570
One additional
thing is, of course,

00:52:23.570 --> 00:52:26.087
telling you who to mate with.

00:52:26.087 --> 00:52:28.170
And it's obvious who you're
supposed to mate with,

00:52:28.170 --> 00:52:29.800
in species after
species-- someone

00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:31.210
who is not related to you.

00:52:31.210 --> 00:52:33.450
Because if you do,
you may inadvertently

00:52:33.450 --> 00:52:37.020
produce babies with two
tails and seven fingers

00:52:37.020 --> 00:52:37.770
and all of that.

00:52:37.770 --> 00:52:39.940
Nobody picked up on the
fact that actually we

00:52:39.940 --> 00:52:42.940
have 10 fingers instead of
five, but we'll let that slide.

00:52:42.940 --> 00:52:45.900
But what you get there
is, oh, avoid inbreeding.

00:52:45.900 --> 00:52:48.130
Don't breed with relatives.

00:52:48.130 --> 00:52:51.050
But we've already heard about
a counterargument, which

00:52:51.050 --> 00:52:55.220
is, breed with relatives because
of the inclusive fitness,

00:52:55.220 --> 00:52:58.300
the kin-selection
advantages of doing that.

00:52:58.300 --> 00:52:59.790
And, from the
first minute people

00:52:59.790 --> 00:53:01.940
started getting these
theoretical models,

00:53:01.940 --> 00:53:04.570
it was clear that,
in fact, there

00:53:04.570 --> 00:53:08.250
were contradictory
pulls between doing

00:53:08.250 --> 00:53:11.510
major outbreeding in
your mating and doing

00:53:11.510 --> 00:53:13.000
inbreeding with your mating.

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:15.660
And people did all
these theoretical models

00:53:15.660 --> 00:53:18.480
of econometrics of where
you optimize the difference.

00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:20.280
And they came out
with the conclusion

00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:23.160
that, in all sorts of
species, the optimal balance

00:53:23.160 --> 00:53:26.980
of avoiding inbreeding
disasters with advantages

00:53:26.980 --> 00:53:29.180
of kin selection would
be to mate with something

00:53:29.180 --> 00:53:31.450
like a third cousin.

00:53:31.450 --> 00:53:34.470
And you go and look at all
sorts of species out there,

00:53:34.470 --> 00:53:36.760
and that's precisely
what they do.

00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:38.660
That's where it balances out.

00:53:38.660 --> 00:53:43.150
And, again, you can't do that
unless you know relatedness.

00:53:43.150 --> 00:53:46.650
Then, a couple of years ago,
along came this researcher--

00:53:46.650 --> 00:53:48.900
Martha McClintock,
University of Chicago.

00:53:48.900 --> 00:53:52.060
She's the person who discovered
the Wellesley effect back when.

00:53:52.060 --> 00:53:54.860
And for all of you guys who are
gearing up for senior honors

00:53:54.860 --> 00:53:58.140
theses, this was her senior
honors thesis-- discovering

00:53:58.140 --> 00:53:59.030
the Wellesley effect.

00:53:59.030 --> 00:54:02.170
So this was, like,
one impressive study.

00:54:02.170 --> 00:54:03.230
Yeah?

00:54:03.230 --> 00:54:06.830
Did Darwin marry a second
cousin? [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:06.830 --> 00:54:08.519
Who did-- he married
a first cousin?

00:54:08.519 --> 00:54:09.560
First cousin [INAUDIBLE].

00:54:09.560 --> 00:54:11.630
First cousin.

00:54:11.630 --> 00:54:12.470
There you go.

00:54:12.470 --> 00:54:15.280
When we all know he would much
rather have married a Galapagos

00:54:15.280 --> 00:54:17.122
tortoise, but his
parents forced him--

00:54:17.122 --> 00:54:18.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:18.300 --> 00:54:22.360
Well, interesting exam-- OK,
so you thus catapult us, here,

00:54:22.360 --> 00:54:23.600
into the human realm.

00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:26.010
What McClintock did was a
study, a couple of years

00:54:26.010 --> 00:54:30.280
ago, where she took swabs-- she
has this whole paradigm of very

00:54:30.280 --> 00:54:32.370
high-tech-- getting cotton
balls and rubbing it

00:54:32.370 --> 00:54:34.560
on people's armpits and
putting it in a jar,

00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:36.440
there, and then getting
these volunteers who

00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:39.570
can [SNIFF] smell it and give
some assessment of how good it

00:54:39.570 --> 00:54:40.600
smells or not.

00:54:40.600 --> 00:54:42.630
Which, in and of
itself, is pretty wild.

00:54:42.630 --> 00:54:44.400
And you run that with humans.

00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:48.640
And of a curve of relatedness,
whose odor gets rated

00:54:48.640 --> 00:54:50.760
as having the most appealing?

00:54:50.760 --> 00:54:52.640
Third cousins.

00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:53.410
Yuck!

00:54:53.410 --> 00:54:54.880
Think about that one later.

00:54:54.880 --> 00:54:57.600
We are just another
species, in that regard.

00:54:57.600 --> 00:55:00.350
All of this suggesting,
even in humans,

00:55:00.350 --> 00:55:03.020
you are balancing
this disadvantages

00:55:03.020 --> 00:55:05.720
of inbreeding with the
kin-selection advantages.

00:55:05.720 --> 00:55:09.010
And, again, there's no way you
can do that without knowing

00:55:09.010 --> 00:55:10.870
who's related to what extent.

00:55:10.870 --> 00:55:11.430
OK.

00:55:11.430 --> 00:55:12.580
Five-minute break.

00:55:12.580 --> 00:55:14.590
And what we'll then
transition to are,

00:55:14.590 --> 00:55:17.590
species that don't do
it innately but instead

00:55:17.590 --> 00:55:21.395
have to imprint, early on,
after encountering them.

00:55:25.510 --> 00:55:27.270
OK, let's get going again.

00:55:32.640 --> 00:55:33.220
Let's see.

00:55:33.220 --> 00:55:37.740
First off, thanks to
the wonders of Wikipedia

00:55:37.740 --> 00:55:42.460
never being that far away
from us, we now know-- here

00:55:42.460 --> 00:55:47.620
were Charles Darwin's parents,
who were third cousins.

00:55:47.620 --> 00:55:52.730
And then Charles Darwin
married his first cousin.

00:55:52.730 --> 00:55:55.730
So there you have it--
something or other.

00:55:55.730 --> 00:55:59.000
But this apparently was
rather common at the time.

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:04.990
And is not quite the optimal,
according to Martha McClintock.

00:56:04.990 --> 00:56:05.590
OK.

00:56:05.590 --> 00:56:06.390
So, pushing on.

00:56:06.390 --> 00:56:08.700
So we've now seen
why you would want

00:56:08.700 --> 00:56:11.060
to recognize your
relatives and recognize

00:56:11.060 --> 00:56:12.280
the degree of relatedness.

00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:16.090
All of our models of who to
compete with, who to mate with,

00:56:16.090 --> 00:56:17.590
who to nurse, who
to take care of,

00:56:17.590 --> 00:56:19.210
who to be voyeuristic about.

00:56:19.210 --> 00:56:20.880
And we've seen the
first domain where

00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:25.700
you can do that, which is to
recognize somebody innately.

00:56:25.700 --> 00:56:28.240
And one very confusing
aspect of it,

00:56:28.240 --> 00:56:29.720
which I managed
to make confusing,

00:56:29.720 --> 00:56:32.180
is-- so, what's
up with olfaction

00:56:32.180 --> 00:56:34.940
with that and oxytocin and
vasopressin and prolactin?

00:56:34.940 --> 00:56:36.610
OK, as follows.

00:56:36.610 --> 00:56:41.960
It is innate that you will have
receptors, olfactory receptors,

00:56:41.960 --> 00:56:44.520
in your olfactory neurons,
in your olfactory bulb--

00:56:44.520 --> 00:56:45.320
in your nose.

00:56:45.320 --> 00:56:48.800
It is innate that you will
have olfactory receptors that

00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:52.030
will be able to detect
degree of relatedness--

00:56:52.030 --> 00:56:56.920
how close an olfactory
signature is to your own.

00:56:56.920 --> 00:56:58.070
That is innate.

00:56:58.070 --> 00:56:59.800
That will be there.

00:56:59.800 --> 00:57:04.780
What appears to be the case
is, oxytocin and vasopressin

00:57:04.780 --> 00:57:09.690
make you more likely to make
those receptors-- increase

00:57:09.690 --> 00:57:11.560
the number of those receptors.

00:57:11.560 --> 00:57:15.700
So this is not oxytocin and
vasopressin making you suddenly

00:57:15.700 --> 00:57:17.390
be able to recognize relatives.

00:57:17.390 --> 00:57:19.610
It's just making
you better at doing

00:57:19.610 --> 00:57:21.660
that-- more sensitized to it.

00:57:21.660 --> 00:57:24.540
So that you have 100
receptors reporting instead

00:57:24.540 --> 00:57:27.100
of 10 of them-- more accuracy.

00:57:27.100 --> 00:57:29.790
What prolactin appears
to be doing is--

00:57:29.790 --> 00:57:32.730
and this is under study,
but the best bet is,

00:57:32.730 --> 00:57:36.270
this is another way of getting
more of these olfactory

00:57:36.270 --> 00:57:38.760
receptors online,
right around birth,

00:57:38.760 --> 00:57:41.610
to innately recognize
your relative.

00:57:41.610 --> 00:57:43.580
And this time, instead
of making neurons

00:57:43.580 --> 00:57:45.790
make more copies
of the receptors,

00:57:45.790 --> 00:57:47.367
it's making more neurons.

00:57:47.367 --> 00:57:49.200
There's going to be
more subtlety than that.

00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:51.780
But broadly, those
are two different ways

00:57:51.780 --> 00:57:54.710
of making you better
at doing something

00:57:54.710 --> 00:57:56.710
that is innate in you.

00:57:56.710 --> 00:58:00.420
Rather than making you suddenly
able to learn how to do this.

00:58:00.420 --> 00:58:03.130
So we now transition
to the second way

00:58:03.130 --> 00:58:04.670
in which relatives
are recognized,

00:58:04.670 --> 00:58:06.250
where it's not innate.

00:58:06.250 --> 00:58:08.470
It requires imprinting.

00:58:08.470 --> 00:58:11.870
It requires some sort
of learning which leaves

00:58:11.870 --> 00:58:14.350
a long-lasting message of it.

00:58:14.350 --> 00:58:15.030
Imprinting.

00:58:15.030 --> 00:58:18.330
So now we've got imprinting in
yet another use of the word.

00:58:18.330 --> 00:58:20.620
And major use of it
coming next Monday.

00:58:20.620 --> 00:58:24.670
Imprinting-- how an animal
learns who its mother is.

00:58:24.670 --> 00:58:27.250
How a mother learns
who its babies are.

00:58:27.250 --> 00:58:31.020
How it imprints on the
smell, on the sound,

00:58:31.020 --> 00:58:33.680
on the whatever of its
offspring or parent--

00:58:33.680 --> 00:58:35.640
how that learning goes on.

00:58:35.640 --> 00:58:38.530
What is clear is,
that's a case where

00:58:38.530 --> 00:58:44.250
the learning that the learning
occurs at that point is innate.

00:58:44.250 --> 00:58:48.380
What is learned is experiential.

00:58:48.380 --> 00:58:50.920
Important sort of
distinction, there.

00:58:50.920 --> 00:58:51.420
OK.

00:58:51.420 --> 00:58:52.790
So, what goes on with this?

00:58:52.790 --> 00:58:55.170
So in lots of species,
you learn the sound

00:58:55.170 --> 00:58:56.330
of your infant's voice.

00:58:56.330 --> 00:58:58.360
In lots of species,
you learn the odor.

00:58:58.360 --> 00:59:01.460
In lots of species, you
learn what they look like.

00:59:01.460 --> 00:59:04.270
Different species, different
modalities that dominate.

00:59:04.270 --> 00:59:07.180
What goes into, for
example, learning what

00:59:07.180 --> 00:59:09.100
your offspring smells like?

00:59:09.100 --> 00:59:11.960
Remember, it's not
innate in these cases.

00:59:11.960 --> 00:59:16.220
For example, a goat, a sheep--
whatever-- they do not innately

00:59:16.220 --> 00:59:19.060
have the means of
recognizing, oh, this

00:59:19.060 --> 00:59:21.860
is somebody whose major
histocompatibility proteins are

00:59:21.860 --> 00:59:23.490
fairly similar to mine.

00:59:23.490 --> 00:59:25.730
In fact, they
share 50% homology.

00:59:25.730 --> 00:59:27.650
Oh, this must be my child.

00:59:27.650 --> 00:59:28.710
That's not done that way.

00:59:28.710 --> 00:59:30.210
These are not innate cases.

00:59:30.210 --> 00:59:32.590
So what sort of rules
might you have for how

00:59:32.590 --> 00:59:34.620
to recognize your offspring?

00:59:34.620 --> 00:59:36.090
Here's a simple one.

00:59:36.090 --> 00:59:39.130
OK, there's a whole
bunch of babies out here,

00:59:39.130 --> 00:59:40.862
and which ones are mine?

00:59:40.862 --> 00:59:42.320
And I'm a goat
trying to figure out

00:59:42.320 --> 00:59:43.528
which one I'm going to nurse.

00:59:43.528 --> 00:59:46.310
What would be a good
rule that is not innate,

00:59:46.310 --> 00:59:48.880
instead building on learning
something at that point?

00:59:48.880 --> 00:59:52.130
I know-- I'm going to start
taking care of whichever kid

00:59:52.130 --> 00:59:55.670
there smells like
my vaginal fluids.

00:59:55.670 --> 00:59:58.050
That's a pretty reliable
way of figuring out

00:59:58.050 --> 01:00:00.690
this is somebody you
just gave birth to.

01:00:00.690 --> 01:00:04.350
Or, this is someone who I lick
as they're first coming out.

01:00:04.350 --> 01:00:08.160
And, for a while afterward, I
figure out, who am I nice to?

01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:10.470
Someone who smells
like my saliva.

01:00:10.470 --> 01:00:12.940
Someone who I scent-mark
right after this

01:00:12.940 --> 01:00:15.510
is someone who smells
like my whatever

01:00:15.510 --> 01:00:17.010
glands I'm using, there.

01:00:17.010 --> 01:00:20.190
This is someone who smells
like my amniotic fluid.

01:00:20.190 --> 01:00:22.340
This is someone who,
after I get that learned,

01:00:22.340 --> 01:00:25.010
I then nurse them for the first
time-- this is someone whose

01:00:25.010 --> 01:00:26.850
mouth smells like my milk.

01:00:26.850 --> 01:00:28.370
You could see,
now, in this case,

01:00:28.370 --> 01:00:30.610
it is learning
being built on top

01:00:30.610 --> 01:00:34.550
of whatever your own
recognition system is of smell.

01:00:34.550 --> 01:00:36.500
You can have
elaborations on this.

01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:40.140
How do you recognize a
sibling in species where it is

01:00:40.140 --> 01:00:42.510
learned in this imprinting way?

01:00:42.510 --> 01:00:45.270
Oh, I'm going to imprint as
a relative on somebody who

01:00:45.270 --> 01:00:47.100
smells just like mom.

01:00:47.100 --> 01:00:50.750
Somebody who smells like mom's
vaginal fluid or her saliva

01:00:50.750 --> 01:00:53.100
or any of that same
stuff going on, there.

01:00:53.100 --> 01:00:56.920
Or, I'm going to be nice to
someone who smells like someone

01:00:56.920 --> 01:00:58.320
I mated with back when.

01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:00.880
That's another strategy
in various species.

01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:03.740
You could begin to
see how all of these

01:01:03.740 --> 01:01:07.140
are ways of just getting
logical information.

01:01:07.140 --> 01:01:10.200
Someone who has the
voice like someone

01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:12.970
who I heard peeping when they
were still inside the egg.

01:01:12.970 --> 01:01:13.782
Oh, it's them!

01:01:13.782 --> 01:01:15.990
I'm going to nurse-- no,
I'm not going to nurse them,

01:01:15.990 --> 01:01:19.340
I'm going to give them worms
or whatever it is birds do.

01:01:19.340 --> 01:01:21.950
But all these ways of
using sensory information

01:01:21.950 --> 01:01:24.260
to say, oh, that's the one!

01:01:24.260 --> 01:01:25.280
That's the one.

01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:27.080
That's how I know it's them.

01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:29.730
So, all sorts of ways in
which this could be done.

01:01:29.730 --> 01:01:33.190
How can you prove that this
is not hardwired-- this is not

01:01:33.190 --> 01:01:34.900
absolutely dominating?

01:01:34.900 --> 01:01:37.150
A technique we've been hearing
about already, which is

01:01:37.150 --> 01:01:39.310
that cross-fostering business.

01:01:39.310 --> 01:01:41.760
Which is, you take
newborn whatevers,

01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:44.060
and you switch mothers
on them, and the mothers

01:01:44.060 --> 01:01:45.240
will take care of them.

01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:46.450
What does that tell you?

01:01:46.450 --> 01:01:50.170
It means other attributes
of these pups coming over

01:01:50.170 --> 01:01:52.950
to them-- these rat pups--
override the fact-- wait,

01:01:52.950 --> 01:01:55.610
these kids don't smell
like my vaginal fluid!

01:01:55.610 --> 01:01:58.760
Wow, they're cute, though, and
there's no other moms around,

01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:00.560
and they sure look cuddly, and--

01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:03.940
So maybe it takes you 10 seconds
to decide, this is one of mine,

01:02:03.940 --> 01:02:05.380
instead of three seconds.

01:02:05.380 --> 01:02:07.930
You have different things
being played out, there.

01:02:07.930 --> 01:02:11.440
Contrasting sort of
signals coming through.

01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:14.360
So that's another
domain of doing that.

01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:18.490
So now we move to us and how
we do recognizing relatives.

01:02:18.490 --> 01:02:20.910
And initially what
the answer seems to be

01:02:20.910 --> 01:02:22.980
is that we have a
different version of it.

01:02:22.980 --> 01:02:26.400
We do not recognize
relatives innately,

01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:29.060
nor do we recognize
relatives by imprinting.

01:02:29.060 --> 01:02:33.070
We don't do that deal of, like,
we smell our parents right

01:02:33.070 --> 01:02:35.920
after they're born, or we
sniff the vaginal fluid

01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:38.890
and that's how we know who
mom is forever after, or stuff

01:02:38.890 --> 01:02:39.620
like that.

01:02:39.620 --> 01:02:41.820
So we don't-- instead,
what do we do?

01:02:41.820 --> 01:02:43.930
We do it cognitively.

01:02:43.930 --> 01:02:45.720
We figure it out.

01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:46.790
We think about it.

01:02:46.790 --> 01:02:51.140
We think about it, with active,
conscious, cognitive rules

01:02:51.140 --> 01:02:53.610
of how you know a relative is.

01:02:53.610 --> 01:02:55.590
And, of course, what
we're going to see shortly

01:02:55.590 --> 01:02:58.330
is, that's not really how
it works, a lot of the time.

01:02:58.330 --> 01:03:01.810
But, for a first pass,
we do it cognitively.

01:03:01.810 --> 01:03:03.590
So now you do it--

01:03:03.590 --> 01:03:06.220
Instead of, this is
someone who smells just

01:03:06.220 --> 01:03:08.670
like my vaginal fluid, the
way the goats are doing,

01:03:08.670 --> 01:03:11.396
or, this is someone who I
innately recognize as my child,

01:03:11.396 --> 01:03:13.270
the way the rats are
doing it, you're saying,

01:03:13.270 --> 01:03:16.145
well, that's the baby
I just gave birth to,

01:03:16.145 --> 01:03:18.270
because they haven't taken
him out of the room yet.

01:03:18.270 --> 01:03:21.030
So that must be-- a
cognitive strategy.

01:03:21.030 --> 01:03:24.090
How do I know who the father is?

01:03:24.090 --> 01:03:26.720
Not because I can
smell in the baby's 50%

01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:28.950
sharing their major
histocompatibility gene.

01:03:28.950 --> 01:03:30.950
This is the only
person I had sex

01:03:30.950 --> 01:03:33.140
with during the cycle
that I conceived.

01:03:33.140 --> 01:03:34.740
A cognitive strategy.

01:03:34.740 --> 01:03:36.490
This is what humans
do, again, [INAUDIBLE]

01:03:36.490 --> 01:03:38.010
because we can think.

01:03:38.010 --> 01:03:39.980
We can go through
stuff like that.

01:03:39.980 --> 01:03:42.730
We can also do other
versions of it,

01:03:42.730 --> 01:03:46.814
which is, well, this is someone
who I saw mom give birth to.

01:03:46.814 --> 01:03:48.730
Or at least when they
took me out of the room,

01:03:48.730 --> 01:03:51.100
and then they, like, gave me
some stuffed animals to keep me

01:03:51.100 --> 01:03:52.350
from, like, getting too upset.

01:03:52.350 --> 01:03:54.480
And then they said, here's
your new baby whatever.

01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:55.630
Oh, OK.

01:03:55.630 --> 01:03:57.460
Which is a variant
on, this is someone

01:03:57.460 --> 01:04:00.780
who's been around ever
since I saw mom give birth

01:04:00.780 --> 01:04:01.980
to that individual.

01:04:01.980 --> 01:04:04.300
This is someone
who looks like me.

01:04:04.300 --> 01:04:06.790
This is someone who looks
like a family member.

01:04:06.790 --> 01:04:10.440
All of these cognitive
strategies, going into that.

01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:12.340
We think about it.

01:04:12.340 --> 01:04:13.460
We think about it.

01:04:13.460 --> 01:04:16.470
And, it turns out, we
have brain mechanisms that

01:04:16.470 --> 01:04:18.480
are good for doing that, too.

01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:20.270
But we're not the
only species that

01:04:20.270 --> 01:04:22.330
thinks about it in that way.

01:04:22.330 --> 01:04:26.830
For example, baboons-- wonderful
study, a few years ago.

01:04:26.830 --> 01:04:30.860
Baboons can do this with some
sort of statistical thinking.

01:04:30.860 --> 01:04:32.579
OK, baboons are polygamous.

01:04:32.579 --> 01:04:34.620
Females will mate with a
bunch of different males

01:04:34.620 --> 01:04:37.870
during her cycle, and conceive,
and thus it's not at all clear

01:04:37.870 --> 01:04:39.500
who the father is.

01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:42.250
But everybody there
plays a guessing game.

01:04:42.250 --> 01:04:44.370
And everybody does
some statistics.

01:04:44.370 --> 01:04:46.890
The usual rule
is, baboons, being

01:04:46.890 --> 01:04:49.610
a highly tournament
species-- males do

01:04:49.610 --> 01:04:51.680
no parental care of offspring.

01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:53.490
Turns out that's
not quite the case.

01:04:53.490 --> 01:04:55.180
Some males do.

01:04:55.180 --> 01:04:58.020
When they're pretty
sure who their kid is.

01:04:58.020 --> 01:04:59.790
And here's how it's done.

01:04:59.790 --> 01:05:02.830
You are a baboon, and you
are just hitting puberty.

01:05:02.830 --> 01:05:03.830
You're female.

01:05:03.830 --> 01:05:07.320
And what goes on is, for, like,
your first half dozen cycles,

01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:09.979
you're cycling but you're
probably not ovulating yet.

01:05:09.979 --> 01:05:11.020
You're not quite fertile.

01:05:11.020 --> 01:05:12.710
This happens in humans, as well.

01:05:12.710 --> 01:05:15.200
And none of the big,
high-ranking guys

01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:18.170
are terribly interested in you,
probably because you're not

01:05:18.170 --> 01:05:20.576
pumping out a whole lot of
interesting pheromones yet.

01:05:20.576 --> 01:05:21.700
So who do you wind up with?

01:05:21.700 --> 01:05:24.490
You wind up with some poor,
like, adolescent schnook

01:05:24.490 --> 01:05:26.500
who has no chance to
mate with anybody else.

01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:29.010
And nobody's
contesting his ability

01:05:29.010 --> 01:05:30.630
to have a consortship with you.

01:05:30.630 --> 01:05:32.260
So you do all of
your mating with him.

01:05:32.260 --> 01:05:34.020
The vast majority of the
time, they're not fertile,

01:05:34.020 --> 01:05:35.270
because you're not really ov--

01:05:35.270 --> 01:05:37.190
Every now and then,
though, you get

01:05:37.190 --> 01:05:38.970
this, like,
junior-high-school baboon

01:05:38.970 --> 01:05:41.180
guy who gets his
girlfriend pregnant,

01:05:41.180 --> 01:05:43.030
and he's the only one.

01:05:43.030 --> 01:05:46.350
And what tends to happen then
is, when she gives birth,

01:05:46.350 --> 01:05:50.840
he gives a fair amount of
parental care to the offspring.

01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:52.790
So what does he have
as a rule, there?

01:05:52.790 --> 01:05:54.930
If I'm the only one
who mated with her--

01:05:54.930 --> 01:05:58.340
if they're using a
cognitive strategy-- then

01:05:58.340 --> 01:06:00.300
I'll take care of the
kid to some extent.

01:06:00.300 --> 01:06:03.760
And it is a sight to
behold, how incredibly inept

01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:05.540
an adolescent male
baboon is when

01:06:05.540 --> 01:06:07.290
he's trying to be paternal.

01:06:07.290 --> 01:06:08.960
But what you wind
up seeing there is,

01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:10.750
well, maybe he's imprinted.

01:06:10.750 --> 01:06:14.360
Maybe he's doing major
histocompatibility gene innate

01:06:14.360 --> 01:06:14.870
stuff.

01:06:14.870 --> 01:06:18.460
Or maybe he's actually thinking,
hey, I was with her 24/7,

01:06:18.460 --> 01:06:19.450
so it's gotta be me.

01:06:19.450 --> 01:06:20.880
I'll take care of the kid.

01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:23.250
Now you see the more
complicated circumstance,

01:06:23.250 --> 01:06:26.710
where it's a more desirable
female-- more mature one--

01:06:26.710 --> 01:06:29.520
where there will be a
bunch of males contesting.

01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:32.910
And what you will tend to
see is, two days before

01:06:32.910 --> 01:06:37.270
and after she ovulates, she'll
be mating with number 10.

01:06:37.270 --> 01:06:40.540
A day before and after,
she's mating with number 3.

01:06:40.540 --> 01:06:42.710
The day of ovulation,
she's mating with number 1.

01:06:42.710 --> 01:06:44.250
That tends to be the pattern.

01:06:44.250 --> 01:06:44.990
Stay tuned.

01:06:44.990 --> 01:06:48.040
It doesn't fit that perfectly,
because female baboons also

01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:50.280
have some opinions about
who they want to mate with.

01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:52.240
But, nonetheless,
there winds up being

01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:55.279
this pattern, just like that.

01:06:55.279 --> 01:06:56.820
So there winds up
being this pattern.

01:06:56.820 --> 01:06:58.757
And thus-- you're
the male, afterward,

01:06:58.757 --> 01:07:00.840
when she gives birth, and
you're trying to decide,

01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:02.120
is this my kid?

01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:05.460
Or, should I give some
male parental investment?

01:07:05.460 --> 01:07:09.960
And what is shown is,
baboon males do statistics.

01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:12.210
They do probability.

01:07:12.210 --> 01:07:14.890
What they do is, if
this was a male who

01:07:14.890 --> 01:07:18.810
was mating during her
prime ovulatory day,

01:07:18.810 --> 01:07:21.230
he is more likely to
take care of the kid

01:07:21.230 --> 01:07:23.620
than a male who was
mating during this window

01:07:23.620 --> 01:07:24.740
or this window.

01:07:24.740 --> 01:07:26.840
They are playing probability.

01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:29.430
They're not very good
at it-- no surprise.

01:07:29.430 --> 01:07:31.530
But nonetheless this
pattern emerges.

01:07:31.530 --> 01:07:33.890
That's not innate recognition.

01:07:33.890 --> 01:07:36.840
That's not innate
recognition of some smell.

01:07:36.840 --> 01:07:39.000
That's just thinking through it.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:40.220
Was I with her?

01:07:40.220 --> 01:07:43.760
Yeah, but she sure smelled
a lot better the day after,

01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:45.350
and that other guy
was with her, so I

01:07:45.350 --> 01:07:46.940
guess I'm in this category.

01:07:46.940 --> 01:07:49.630
OK, well, I'll smile at the
kid now and then tell him I

01:07:49.630 --> 01:07:50.720
like their piano playing.

01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:53.500
But I'm not going to,
like, invest anything--

01:07:53.500 --> 01:07:54.710
kind of stuff, there.

01:07:54.710 --> 01:07:58.060
Here, you see a conscious,
cognitive strategy.

01:07:58.060 --> 01:08:01.430
So, OK, so us and other
smart beasties like primates.

01:08:01.430 --> 01:08:06.550
Here's another version of it,
occurring in fish-- in sunfish.

01:08:06.550 --> 01:08:08.790
And this was research
done by that guy

01:08:08.790 --> 01:08:12.120
David Sloan Wilson, that
multilevel-selection-evolution

01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:15.050
evolution guy, who actually
has done research in, like,

01:08:15.050 --> 01:08:16.109
so many different fields.

01:08:16.109 --> 01:08:17.640
Incredibly creative guy.

01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:19.290
Here's a study that he did.

01:08:19.290 --> 01:08:23.270
Sunfish males,
surprisingly, are quite

01:08:23.270 --> 01:08:27.000
paternal in their taking care
of their eventual offspring.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:30.195
They're almost as
good as Nemo's dad.

01:08:30.195 --> 01:08:34.330
And what you've got there
is, in this version, he--

01:08:34.330 --> 01:08:36.500
I'm not going to
draw fish mating.

01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:37.130
Forget that!

01:08:37.130 --> 01:08:37.630
OK.

01:08:37.630 --> 01:08:39.450
So the guy mates
with the female,

01:08:39.450 --> 01:08:42.410
and she eventually
gives birth to kids.

01:08:42.410 --> 01:08:44.140
And he helps take care of them.

01:08:44.140 --> 01:08:46.890
Now, instead, he
mates with a female--

01:08:46.890 --> 01:08:50.149
and you, the savagely
heartless researcher,

01:08:50.149 --> 01:08:51.720
puts him in the next
tank over, where

01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:53.430
he can see what's happening.

01:08:53.430 --> 01:08:56.470
And you fiendishly,
at that point,

01:08:56.470 --> 01:09:00.470
drop down a clear plastic
box right next to the female,

01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:02.837
with another male in there!

01:09:02.837 --> 01:09:04.670
In reality, he's not
mating with the female,

01:09:04.670 --> 01:09:05.544
but he's right there.

01:09:05.544 --> 01:09:07.965
And this guy, who's stuck on
the other side of the barrier

01:09:07.965 --> 01:09:11.810
and going out of his mind
with jealousy and petulance

01:09:11.810 --> 01:09:13.550
and all of that immature stuff.

01:09:13.550 --> 01:09:15.899
And what happens is,
after she eventually

01:09:15.899 --> 01:09:18.260
gives birth, she-- this
apparently being the female,

01:09:18.260 --> 01:09:19.220
in this diagram.

01:09:19.220 --> 01:09:22.080
After she gives birth, he
doesn't take care of the kids

01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:23.000
as much.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:26.260
There is no difference in
any of the sensory cues.

01:09:26.260 --> 01:09:28.500
Because he, in fact, is
the only one who mated.

01:09:28.500 --> 01:09:29.760
This one is kept inside.

01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:34.170
There is some sort of cognitive
stuff even going on in a fish.

01:09:34.170 --> 01:09:35.729
Remarkable.

01:09:35.729 --> 01:09:37.810
So it's not just us.

01:09:37.810 --> 01:09:40.590
So we've got this broad
realm-- innate strategies.

01:09:40.590 --> 01:09:44.250
One's on very all-or-none
sensory imprinting.

01:09:44.250 --> 01:09:46.700
And then there's the folks
who think through it.

01:09:46.700 --> 01:09:49.540
We're in the mainstream of that,
but we're not the only ones.

01:09:49.540 --> 01:09:51.760
So how do our brains do that?

01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:55.130
There is a part of the human
cortex called the "fusiform

01:09:55.130 --> 01:09:56.000
cortex."

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:59.520
And what it's good at
is recognizing faces,

01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:01.670
which is a remarkable thing.

01:10:01.670 --> 01:10:06.020
It specializes in recognizing
faces, facial expression,

01:10:06.020 --> 01:10:07.600
degree of relatedness.

01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:10.705
You show someone a good
portrait of someone else,

01:10:10.705 --> 01:10:12.330
and you will get that
part of the brain

01:10:12.330 --> 01:10:14.480
to activate as if
it was their face.

01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:16.520
You show a good
cartoon of somebody.

01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:18.620
It will do the same thing,
maybe with a little bit

01:10:18.620 --> 01:10:19.640
less confidence.

01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:22.500
This is the specialized
part of the cortex

01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:24.510
that does facial recognition.

01:10:24.510 --> 01:10:26.000
Remarkable.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:29.820
You look at people with autism,
and this part of the cortex

01:10:29.820 --> 01:10:31.490
doesn't do a whole lot.

01:10:31.490 --> 01:10:33.740
You show a
nonautistic individual

01:10:33.740 --> 01:10:37.580
a picture of a
well-known loved one.

01:10:37.580 --> 01:10:39.414
Fusiform cortex
activates a whole lot.

01:10:39.414 --> 01:10:40.830
You show them a
picture of someone

01:10:40.830 --> 01:10:42.270
they don't know a whole lot.

01:10:42.270 --> 01:10:44.180
It activates somewhat
to a lesser degree.

01:10:44.180 --> 01:10:46.840
You show them a
picture of an armchair.

01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:48.350
Doesn't do anything at all.

01:10:48.350 --> 01:10:51.230
You take someone who is
autistic, and you show them,

01:10:51.230 --> 01:10:55.660
and you get the same low-degree
activation for all three.

01:10:55.660 --> 01:10:59.820
You know, mother equals
stranger equals armchair.

01:10:59.820 --> 01:11:03.120
This in some ways is the
core of what autism is about.

01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:07.420
You see that going on, as played
out in this part of the cortex.

01:11:07.420 --> 01:11:09.082
So that's really interesting.

01:11:09.082 --> 01:11:11.290
And then it turns out we're
not the only species that

01:11:11.290 --> 01:11:14.040
has this specialized
fusiform cortex.

01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:17.030
Primates have this, as
well-- nonhuman primates.

01:11:17.030 --> 01:11:18.790
Sheep have it, it turns out.

01:11:18.790 --> 01:11:21.794
Pigeons who could recognize
pictures of each other.

01:11:21.794 --> 01:11:23.710
And why they would want
to do that, god knows.

01:11:23.710 --> 01:11:29.960
But pigeons have a very proto
version of the fusiform cortex.

01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:31.990
This seems to be
part of what goes

01:11:31.990 --> 01:11:36.270
into this conscious, cognitive
strategizing of, this

01:11:36.270 --> 01:11:38.220
is a face, this is
a face I've seen

01:11:38.220 --> 01:11:39.870
a whole lot more over the years.

01:11:39.870 --> 01:11:41.900
So this activates a lot more.

01:11:41.900 --> 01:11:46.540
This seems to suggest some
sort of cortical specialization

01:11:46.540 --> 01:11:49.660
for recognizing individuals.

01:11:49.660 --> 01:11:51.840
More features of
how humans do it.

01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:53.820
Something that humans
are very good at,

01:11:53.820 --> 01:11:56.560
if they are human
mothers, is recognizing

01:11:56.560 --> 01:11:59.790
the smell of their
baby right after birth.

01:11:59.790 --> 01:12:03.170
And this has been shown to
have a major histocompatibility

01:12:03.170 --> 01:12:04.400
component to it.

01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:08.040
In other words, that's not
a purely cognitive strategy.

01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:11.640
There's some innate,
instinctual olfactory

01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:13.200
signaling going on there.

01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:16.200
So, a first bit of
evidence is that we are not

01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:18.400
just purely rational
beasts at figuring out

01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:19.900
who we're related to.

01:12:19.900 --> 01:12:22.420
Babies, very
shortly after birth,

01:12:22.420 --> 01:12:25.430
are already spectacularly good
at distinguishing the smell

01:12:25.430 --> 01:12:27.230
of Mom versus somebody else.

01:12:27.230 --> 01:12:28.980
How do you tell
that with a baby?

01:12:28.980 --> 01:12:32.510
You take a newborn baby, and you
give them, like, on this side,

01:12:32.510 --> 01:12:37.150
some armpit smell of Mom, and
there's some armpit smell of,

01:12:37.150 --> 01:12:39.650
you know-- I don't
know-- Margaret Thatcher.

01:12:39.650 --> 01:12:43.910
And what you see, then, is
that the baby, the newborn,

01:12:43.910 --> 01:12:46.090
is more likely-- will
spend more time turning

01:12:46.090 --> 01:12:47.800
its head towards Mom's smell.

01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:48.950
That's how you know it.

01:12:48.950 --> 01:12:52.050
Newborn babies cannot
distinguish between the smell

01:12:52.050 --> 01:12:54.100
of Dad and any other male.

01:12:54.100 --> 01:12:56.780
It's not instinctual,
in that case.

01:12:56.780 --> 01:13:01.400
Newborn humans are doing some
version of proximity to mom,

01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:03.430
vaginal fluid smell-- whatever.

01:13:03.430 --> 01:13:05.390
This seems to be bringing
up a question of,

01:13:05.390 --> 01:13:09.740
is there a difference in
bonding in those early stages

01:13:09.740 --> 01:13:13.325
between vaginal-birth
offspring and cesareans?

01:13:13.325 --> 01:13:15.700
I don't know, but that suggests
that should be happening.

01:13:15.700 --> 01:13:17.970
And maybe I should
even find that out.

01:13:17.970 --> 01:13:18.860
OK.

01:13:18.860 --> 01:13:20.090
Other features of it.

01:13:20.090 --> 01:13:23.710
Newborn kids, as we already
know from a couple lectures ago,

01:13:23.710 --> 01:13:25.960
can recognize the voice of Mom.

01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:26.620
How?

01:13:26.620 --> 01:13:29.950
From all that resonance, there,
inside the amniotic fluid,

01:13:29.950 --> 01:13:31.950
as Mom reads them War and Peace.

01:13:31.950 --> 01:13:33.800
And, as we also
heard, they can't

01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:35.760
recognize the voice of Dad.

01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:37.160
Not instinctual.

01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:39.210
In this case,
getting information

01:13:39.210 --> 01:13:42.840
on the sensory route--
the amniotic environment

01:13:42.840 --> 01:13:45.490
as a good resonator
for Mom's voice.

01:13:45.490 --> 01:13:47.680
So we're now already
getting a mixture, here,

01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:50.680
of some instinctual
olfactory stuff,

01:13:50.680 --> 01:13:54.690
major-histocompatibility-complex
stuff, some acquired,

01:13:54.690 --> 01:13:57.170
hardwired sensory-driven stuff.

01:13:57.170 --> 01:13:59.920
Ooh, does this sound like the
person whose voice I heard

01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:01.310
for those last nine months?

01:14:01.310 --> 01:14:04.500
And then some cognitive
stuff-- trying to figure out

01:14:04.500 --> 01:14:05.970
who this relative is.

01:14:05.970 --> 01:14:09.050
Ooh, who did they come
with to the party with?

01:14:09.050 --> 01:14:10.830
All of that-- the
cognitive stuff.

01:14:10.830 --> 01:14:12.970
So, already a suggestion
that we're not just

01:14:12.970 --> 01:14:15.510
such pure cognitive machines.

01:14:15.510 --> 01:14:17.510
So where is that
most interesting?

01:14:17.510 --> 01:14:20.480
And this is in a totally
fascinating series

01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:22.520
of studies that were
done over the years,

01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:26.360
showing just how little
conscious cognition might

01:14:26.360 --> 01:14:29.570
play out in us humans in
some really critical realms.

01:14:29.570 --> 01:14:34.330
Which is, who you decide you
are interested in mating with.

01:14:34.330 --> 01:14:37.040
OK, so how does
that work in humans?

01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:38.364
All sorts of different ways.

01:14:38.364 --> 01:14:40.780
But here's one way in which
it does something interesting.

01:14:40.780 --> 01:14:44.530
And this was a classic study
done by an anthropologist named

01:14:44.530 --> 01:14:45.730
Joseph Schaeffer.

01:14:45.730 --> 01:14:46.940
And this is what he did.

01:14:46.940 --> 01:14:50.960
He studied people who grew
up in Israel on kibbutzes.

01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:53.780
Kibbutzes-- these are these
traditional, socialist sort

01:14:53.780 --> 01:14:56.220
of communes, where one
of the-- none of them

01:14:56.220 --> 01:14:57.270
are like this anymore.

01:14:57.270 --> 01:14:59.832
But one of the early
principles was, one parent

01:14:59.832 --> 01:15:01.040
is as good as another parent.

01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:04.000
All the kids are raised in
these big, communal bathtubs

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:04.530
together.

01:15:04.530 --> 01:15:07.570
And it's one big, sort
of socialist [INAUDIBLE]

01:15:07.570 --> 01:15:09.640
of everybody bathing
naked together.

01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:13.470
And what Schaeffer found was
this very interesting thing.

01:15:13.470 --> 01:15:16.360
Which is, you are brought
up in your age group.

01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:18.660
All the kids born
this year are raised

01:15:18.660 --> 01:15:20.060
in the same communal group.

01:15:20.060 --> 01:15:21.672
And they take their
baths together,

01:15:21.672 --> 01:15:23.130
and they play
together, and they've

01:15:23.130 --> 01:15:25.720
got the same-- one
parent takes all of them

01:15:25.720 --> 01:15:27.630
for one afternoon,
every Tuesday afternoon,

01:15:27.630 --> 01:15:29.857
and the next one comes
for the next shift.

01:15:29.857 --> 01:15:31.440
And this big communal
business, there.

01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:33.790
And what Schaeffer
discovered was,

01:15:33.790 --> 01:15:37.850
if you were raised in the
same age group as somebody,

01:15:37.850 --> 01:15:41.080
anywhere up to six
years of age, you never,

01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:43.780
ever wind up marrying them.

01:15:43.780 --> 01:15:47.160
And this was not with a sample--
an appropriate sampling.

01:15:47.160 --> 01:15:50.740
This was a study he did of every
individual who ever grew up

01:15:50.740 --> 01:15:52.620
in the kibbutz system in Israel.

01:15:52.620 --> 01:15:55.620
We appear to have
a rule as follows.

01:15:55.620 --> 01:15:58.620
If this is somebody who you
spent a whole lot of time

01:15:58.620 --> 01:16:01.240
with before six
years of age, this

01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:03.250
is someone who you
sure don't want

01:16:03.250 --> 01:16:04.930
to grow up and marry-- yuck!

01:16:04.930 --> 01:16:06.430
And you love them--
they're incred--

01:16:06.430 --> 01:16:09.030
but they feel like my sister.

01:16:09.030 --> 01:16:10.680
They feel like my brother.

01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:12.810
Whoa, that would be
totally grotesque!

01:16:12.810 --> 01:16:15.230
There has never been a
case of people brought

01:16:15.230 --> 01:16:18.070
up during the first-- grow up
in your first six years of life,

01:16:18.070 --> 01:16:20.190
taking a whole lot of
baths with someone,

01:16:20.190 --> 01:16:22.670
and you are not going to
discover an amorous passion

01:16:22.670 --> 01:16:24.340
for them when
you're 20 years old.

01:16:24.340 --> 01:16:26.580
They're going to feel
like a sibling for you,

01:16:26.580 --> 01:16:28.280
for the rest of your life.

01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:29.450
What is that telling us?

01:16:29.450 --> 01:16:33.315
We have a very noncognitive
strategy in there.

01:16:33.315 --> 01:16:35.440
Yes, who are relatives--
who are appropriate people

01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:36.250
to mate with?

01:16:36.250 --> 01:16:39.280
Well, if we know that this is
the daughter of Mom's sister,

01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:40.860
then this person
is not appropriate,

01:16:40.860 --> 01:16:43.520
and this whole cognitive--
spend a whole lot of time

01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:46.620
naked with somebody, taking
baths and playing pattycake

01:16:46.620 --> 01:16:49.380
and counting their toes,
the first six years of life,

01:16:49.380 --> 01:16:51.050
they feel like a sibling.

01:16:51.050 --> 01:16:54.120
Something very similar was
then shown by Arthur Wolf,

01:16:54.120 --> 01:16:56.430
here, in the
Anthropology department--

01:16:56.430 --> 01:16:57.860
a different cultural version.

01:16:57.860 --> 01:17:00.300
Traditional Taiwanese
marriages, where

01:17:00.300 --> 01:17:04.140
there's some equivalent of that,
and where either you wind up

01:17:04.140 --> 01:17:07.610
with your future spouse
at some insanely early age

01:17:07.610 --> 01:17:10.410
and basically get brought
up with them from infancy,

01:17:10.410 --> 01:17:11.740
or it happens later.

01:17:11.740 --> 01:17:14.230
And if you're brought up
from infancy with them,

01:17:14.230 --> 01:17:16.360
you have a disastrous
marriage later on,

01:17:16.360 --> 01:17:19.280
because they feel like a sibling
for the rest of your life.

01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:21.920
So what this shows
us here is, yes, we

01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:25.340
are these wonderful,
rational, cognitive machines.

01:17:25.340 --> 01:17:28.330
We've got all sorts
of innate strategies

01:17:28.330 --> 01:17:31.840
and sensory-imprinting stuff
going on, instead, in us.

01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:34.790
We are not a whole lot
fancier than hamsters.

01:17:34.790 --> 01:17:36.720
What does this set us up for?

01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:39.160
A topic that's going to
be real important when

01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:43.260
we come to the lectures on
aggression and cooperation

01:17:43.260 --> 01:17:45.390
and competition and all of that.

01:17:45.390 --> 01:17:49.040
Which is, if we spend a lot
of our time figuring out

01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:52.690
who we are related
to-- cognitively--

01:17:52.690 --> 01:17:54.880
or, even more
importantly, if we are

01:17:54.880 --> 01:17:57.880
malleable in the way these
kids growing up in Taiwan,

01:17:57.880 --> 01:17:59.540
or in these
kibbutzes-- if we are

01:17:59.540 --> 01:18:03.440
malleable in who
we feel related to,

01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:06.890
it is possible to manipulate
us in lots of ways

01:18:06.890 --> 01:18:09.190
to feel more related
to individuals

01:18:09.190 --> 01:18:13.130
than we actually are, or to feel
less related to individuals.

01:18:13.130 --> 01:18:16.390
And the terms for these
are "pseudo kinship"

01:18:16.390 --> 01:18:18.280
and "pseudo speciation."

01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:20.010
And what we will
eventually see is,

01:18:20.010 --> 01:18:23.620
when you make sense of human
violence and human cooperation

01:18:23.620 --> 01:18:25.650
and human aggression
and all of that,

01:18:25.650 --> 01:18:29.970
we are so easily manipulated
as to who counts as an "us"

01:18:29.970 --> 01:18:31.630
and who counts as a "them."

01:18:31.630 --> 01:18:35.250
And one of the brilliant things
militaries all the world over

01:18:35.250 --> 01:18:38.940
do, whether you're talking
about clans with warrior classes

01:18:38.940 --> 01:18:41.660
all the way up to sort
of state militaries--

01:18:41.660 --> 01:18:45.210
what you see in all these cases
is a brilliant understanding

01:18:45.210 --> 01:18:48.720
of how to make nonrelatives feel
like they're a band of brothers

01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:51.560
and how to make "them" seem
so different they hardly

01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:52.970
even count as humans.

01:18:52.970 --> 01:18:55.870
So this ability for
us to be manipulated

01:18:55.870 --> 01:18:59.560
in these subliminal ways, as
to who counts as a relative,

01:18:59.560 --> 01:19:01.850
will come back to
haunt us big-time

01:19:01.850 --> 01:19:04.920
in making sense of a lot
of human social behavior.

01:19:04.920 --> 01:19:08.060
In other words, we are
not purely rational.

01:19:08.060 --> 01:19:08.690
OK.

01:19:08.690 --> 01:19:11.520
So what we will do on Monday
is switch another bucket, now,

01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:14.540
to this field of ethology,
which, once again, is trying

01:19:14.540 --> 01:19:17.399
to make sense of, what
behaviors are hardwired,

01:19:17.399 --> 01:19:18.440
what does environment do?

01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:21.750
You will see a completely
different approach--

01:19:21.750 --> 01:19:25.010

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:05.990
Stanford University.

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:12.600
Let's get started.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:18.830
Let's see.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.620
Once again, game plan for
the coming week or so.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:27.230
Next three lectures will be the
TA overviews-- introductions

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.530
to nervous system,
endocrinology.

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:32.770
Once again-- what I
emphasized the other day is--

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.890
if you're not sure if you've
got enough background exposure

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.870
to these topics for
it to be worth coming,

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.160
I would suggest you
assume that you don't.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.910
Because it could do
nothing more than

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.330
help, even if you've had
a lot of this before.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.090
Following that, some more
advanced topics in the subject,

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.830
and then barreling
on into the midterm.

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:52.360
OK.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.180
Today we leap yet
another discipline

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:00.100
into yet another one, this one
being concerned with basically

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.250
the same exact issues that we've
had before-- nature, nurture,

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.890
interaction, behavior.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.220
And this one, as you will see,
with a completely different

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.800
approach than all
the prior ones.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.080
Now the other day, when going
through what heritability means

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.680
and doesn't mean, one of the key
points that came out at the end

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.900
was that whole business of,
the more different environments

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.260
you study something in, the
lower your heritability term

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:28.840
is going to be.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.470
So what's one of the punch
lines that comes out of that?

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.280
If you want to understand
the genetics of behavior,

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.690
you've got to go look
at the behavior in lots

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.340
of different environments.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.430
What today's
discipline is about is

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.160
taking that one step broader.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.110
If you want to
understand anything

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.120
about the biology of
behavior, number one,

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.390
you want to study it in lots
of different environments.

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.860
Number two, you want to study
it in as natural of environments

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:54.830
as possible.

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.790
And number three,
go in there assuming

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.750
that you are going to have
to translate a language.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.000
The quote at the
beginning there,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.810
something to the
effect of ethology,

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.920
the field we'll be
looking at today.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.190
Ethology is the process
of interviewing an animal,

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.270
but in its own language.

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.890
So what we'll see
here is this is

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.140
an expansion, in a certain way,
on that notion that if you want

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.140
to understand behavior, get your
animal out of the laboratory.

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.390
Now to begin to
sort of appreciate

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.360
the context this
has in history, we

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.500
start off-- God help us--
with history of psychology

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.340
at around 1900 or so.

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.500
When, universally agreed upon,
the Grand Poobah of psychology

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.820
was William James.

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.321
And all I know
about William James

00:02:40.321 --> 00:02:41.820
is that he was
highly philosophical,

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.920
and I fall asleep every
time I try to read the guy.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.650
But he dominated the period
in a way in which psychology

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.230
was basically an introspective
business that was

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.300
sort of a branch of philosophy.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.400
And coming out in the
decades after that

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.750
were the Young
Turks of psychology,

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.150
who despised this whole
approach, because they wanted

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.290
to make psychology a science--
a quantitative science,

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:08.990
an experimental science.

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:10.580
They wanted numbers.

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.620
Enough of this philosophy stuff.

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:18.760
And out of it came this very
deep, deep reflexive distrust

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.400
of any behavior you couldn't
see and you couldn't measure.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.750
And you didn't want to know what
was going on inside anybody's

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.980
personal life,
inside their head,

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.240
whether they were
a fish or a human.

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.590
All you were
interested in is what

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.500
was going on in
the outside world

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.670
just before that
behavior occurred

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.520
and what behavior was it.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.820
Simple organisms as
input output black boxes.

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.020
Forget this philosophy stuff.

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.650
Give me something I can measure.

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.510
And this was this
emerging discipline

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.800
of behaviorism, which
became the dominant school

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.870
in American psychology by the
middle of the last century.

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.050
We've already heard from one of
the starting founding fathers

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.010
of it, and that was John Watson.

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.080
That was the guy from the
first lecture-- give me

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.640
a kid from any
background, and I'll

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.810
turn him into a butcher,
baker, candlestick maker

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.750
sort of thing, and
that everything could

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.030
be controlled in environment.

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.660
And thus, you could
shape behavior

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.430
to any direction you want.

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.870
Behaviorism sort of hit its
heyday, its absolute apogee,

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.790
with its most
famous practitioner,

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:24.440
who was BF Skinner.

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.720
Skinner-- who dominated, I
think, most studies show.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.760
Or that he was the
best known, most

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.850
cited psychologist
throughout the middle part

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.010
of the last century.

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.090
Incredibly influential, and
American psychology at the time

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.220
was all about behaviors.

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.000
What are the key features of it?

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.320
First one was this
hysterical, radical, extreme

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:49.880
environmentalism.

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:54.740
The notion that we are all
table rases, whatever that is.

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.370
That we are all blank slates
and all that we come in with

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:02.430
is this blank slate to be
written on by environment.

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:03.930
Don't tell me about genes.

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.030
Don't tell me about
biology at all.

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:07.630
Don't tell me about
anything other

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:09.920
than what's going on
in the environment,

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.350
and how does that shape
the behavior coming out

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:14.590
the other end, and
can I measure it?

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:20.140
Extreme radical environmentalism
in terms of gene environment.

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:21.450
There were no genes.

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:25.100
There were no interactions as
far as they were concerned.

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.770
The next building
principal was this notion

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:30.150
of reinforcement theory.

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:34.220
Let me control when any
given organism receives

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:37.890
a positive
reinforcement, a reward.

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:41.520
Let me control when it receives
a negative reinforcement

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:42.690
of punishment.

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:46.070
Give me the ability to control
those in the environment,

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:50.250
and I will produce any behavior
you want in that organism.

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:53.550
Once again, whether it is a
fish or a human and everything

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:57.510
in between, this utter
reliance on behavior

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:02.650
is shaped by the rewards and
punishments of environment.

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:04.950
Reinforcement theory.

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:09.510
The final piece of it was
this notion of universality.

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:11.860
Which is, it works
this way in everybody!

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:15.120
It works this way in every
single species out there.

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.765
And if you want
to study lab rats,

00:06:16.765 --> 00:06:18.640
you're going to learn
the exact same thing as

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:20.100
if you were studying giraffes.

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:22.500
But it's a lot harder
to study them in a lab.

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:24.330
You sure don't need
to study them out

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:27.990
in their natural habitat,
because it's just understanding

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:31.010
the reinforcements coming
in, the behavior coming out

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:31.930
the other end.

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:34.100
They're all the same.

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:37.100
This period dominated
by the behaviorists

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:39.940
was, historically, a total drag.

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:43.050
Because these guys had just
a stranglehold on the field.

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:45.470
And all of them,
like, looked the same.

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:48.140
If you ever look in one
of those time-life books

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:50.040
on the history of
the mind or whatever,

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.930
there will be the
inevitable picture

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:54.580
of BF Skinner with some pigeon.

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:58.155
And Skinner was
like your archetypal

00:06:58.155 --> 00:07:00.420
out-of-central-casting
behaviors.

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:05.570
He had this inordinately shiny
forehead and these big glasses.

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:07.390
And every picture of
him, for some reason,

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:10.310
photographers were always
forced to kneel down and take

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:12.880
a picture of him looming
over with his pigeon.

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:15.900
And everything considered, this
was an incredibly frightening

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:16.960
looking man.

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:21.050
And he would then be free to
go on with astonishing quotes

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:25.290
like, dog, cat, rat,
child, doesn't matter.

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:26.630
It's all the same.

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:30.350
This notion of universality
of behaviorism.

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:34.600
And Skinner invented all
sorts of Utopian societies--

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:36.910
one, a book of his that
was very influential,

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:39.100
a novel called Walden Two.

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:43.260
You can build a perfect world
out of reinforcement theory

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:44.930
all with environmentalism.

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:47.710
And I could have built
the exact same utopia

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:53.690
studying this with grasshoppers
as with humans-- boy, cat, dog,

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:54.700
rat, whatever.

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:56.090
They're all the same.

00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:59.790
So the building of American
behaviorism-- utter reliance

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:03.940
on environmentalism, utter
reliance on the notion that all

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:05.820
of behavior could
be explained-- could

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:08.940
be shaped by the
rewards and punishments,

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:11.770
the positive and negative
reinforcements of environment.

00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:15.590
And this works the same way
in every single type of animal

00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:18.300
out there, so you might as
well just study it in a rat,

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:19.340
in a pigeon.

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:22.900
Those were the two backbones
of behaviorist research.

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:24.800
Because they're a
lot more convenient.

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.030
And you can study it in
the lab, because it's

00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:28.490
the exact same thing.

00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:32.700
It is purely a function of the
environment you're controlling.

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:34.710
And you understand that.

00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:36.720
And as long as there is
some behavior coming out

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:39.720
the other end that you could
measure and generate numbers,

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:42.049
you are doing
scientific psychology,

00:08:42.049 --> 00:08:44.930
and this is what the
whole field was about.

00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:48.660
Meanwhile, over in Europe,
there was a totally different

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:50.870
tradition emerging.

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:54.530
And what it has its greatest
similarities to is--

00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:56.170
you know, you read
any of these books

00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:58.950
on the history of evolution,
and there's always

00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:01.510
this phase of like all
of these 19th century

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:04.820
British naturalists,
where like half of them

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:07.790
were Parsons in some
Anglican church or whatever.

00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:09.260
They always had to be Parsons.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.100
And they would always
be out trumping

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:13.989
around the woods of England
with a butterfly net.

00:09:13.989 --> 00:09:15.780
And these were the guys
who would come back

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:18.090
with a gazillion different
types of butterflies.

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:20.040
This is when
butterfly collecting

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:24.350
became this obsession with like
British, upper middle class

00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:27.054
and Parsons and stuff who would
just go out in the country.

00:09:27.054 --> 00:09:27.970
And what would you do?

00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:31.100
You would come back, and you
would generate these whatevers

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:35.310
of all the different types of
butterflies and just wallow

00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:37.090
in the variability.

00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:39.100
That was the main thing of it.

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:41.760
Look at all these
different colors.

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:44.470
Look at all these
different shapes of wings.

00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:47.520
The interpretation at the time
of course was, look at all

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:49.760
this glorious
variability of life

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:52.110
and God's work showing in it.

00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:55.400
But the main thing emotionally
that these guys were about

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:59.170
was variety-- the
range of differences,

00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:03.830
the range of different ways
that species could look like.

00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:06.900
And what this new field
was emerging in Europe

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:08.340
was ethology.

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:12.600
What ethology was about was
the same exact emotional pulse

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:16.090
as in those 19th century
Parsons with the butterfly nets.

00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:20.970
But what ethologists would do
is go out and collect behaviors.

00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:25.530
And they would come back, and
they would just wallow and just

00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:27.950
be buoyant by all of
the different types

00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:30.240
of behavioral variety.

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:32.470
And that's the most
important thing.

00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:34.270
So we can see right
off the bat, they

00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:36.130
are not going to be
getting along very

00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:38.520
well with the behaviorists--
with the rat equals boy

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:40.320
equals hippo business there.

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:42.390
Because what these
guys were all about

00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:47.150
was just the sheer variety of
behavior and, implicit in that,

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:51.170
how you have to study it
in natural environments.

00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:53.530
So there were three
guys during this period,

00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:55.780
beginning work early in
the 20th century, who

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:59.720
were the official godfathers
of the whole field of ethology.

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:04.180
One was Niko Tinbergen.
Next was Konrad Lorenz.

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:05.990
The next was Hugo Von Frisch.

00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:07.200
And these were the big three.

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:09.740
They eventually got
their Nobel prizes.

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:14.890
And Tinbergen was basically
a saint, an incredibly sort

00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:17.280
of accomplished,
interesting man who

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:19.870
did all sorts of
extraordinarily good things.

00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:22.860
Konrad Lorenz, as we
know, was Nazi scum.

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:27.620
And Hugo Von Frisch was just
really, really, really old.

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:30.980
Somehow he was just really
old from the very beginning.

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:34.130
And he was about 89 when
he got his Nobel price.

00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:37.060
These were the starting three
that began the whole field.

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:40.940
So we've got our archetypal
behaviorist villains there

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:44.660
with their shiny foreheads
leaning over the camera guy

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:46.380
and waving pigeons at them.

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:48.190
And what are the
ethologists about?

00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:51.620
All of them were guys with
these knobby knees and very

00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:55.370
hairy legs, with big thick
old hiking boots covered

00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:57.420
in mud and alpine whatevers.

00:11:57.420 --> 00:11:59.440
And what they were
doing was just

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:03.830
tromping around in the outside
world collecting behaviors,

00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:06.050
just looking at
the sheer variety.

00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:06.550
OK.

00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:09.060
It's obvious which team
I'm rooting for here.

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:13.360
But even, you know, that they
hung out with Konrad Lorenz.

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:13.860
OK.

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:17.150
The ethologists are
much more nuanced--

00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:20.800
the much broader, much
more multi-faceted,

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:22.660
diverse view of life there.

00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:26.690
The ethologists, completely
unconnected with behaviorism

00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:27.900
in the United States.

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:30.290
Instead, we're developing
this whole field

00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:34.260
premised on all sorts of
very different notions.

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:37.500
Behaviorists, this
radical environmentalism.

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:40.640
What ethology was
about, from day one,

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:44.390
was gene environment
interactions--

00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:49.550
behaviorist rules of positive
negative reinforcement.

00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:52.080
That explains the entire world.

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:55.320
As we'll see, some of the most
amazing things ethologists

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:59.010
came up with were examples
of animals acquiring

00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:03.790
new behaviors that broke every
rule on earth of behaviorism

00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:06.340
about how learning occurs.

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:08.650
Finally, over there
with the behaviorists,

00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:12.240
with their universality--
cat equals hippo--

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:15.030
and what the ethologists
were about was,

00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:19.410
every species solves its
environmental challenges,

00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:23.710
and its history of evolutionary
challenges, in a unique way.

00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:26.780
And out of that came
Tinbergen's famous quote.

00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:31.450
Which is, again, ethology is
the study of animal behavior,

00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:35.570
but where you're interviewing
the animal in its own language.

00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:37.540
And the whole
premise of ethology

00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:40.705
was, that's
preferable, and that's

00:13:40.705 --> 00:13:42.080
not going to happen
unless you're

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:45.180
out there in the nature in
the animal's real habitat.

00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:47.570
And you better be
real open minded

00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:51.130
as to what counts as
communication, as what

00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:53.780
counts to be the animal's
language that you

00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:55.920
are talking to it with.

00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:57.401
One example of this.

00:13:57.401 --> 00:13:59.400
And this was somewhat of
a different discipline,

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:01.950
but in the 1960s, there was
this very interesting sort

00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:04.580
of cottage industry of
research that came out.

00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:07.330
Which is, you take
a normal lab rat.

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:09.030
And now what you do
instead is put it

00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:10.840
in an enriched environment.

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:14.210
You put it in a big
enclosure with lots

00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:19.160
of other rats and beeping toys
and interesting smells and cell

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:21.710
phones and all sorts
of sounds of that sort.

00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:25.520
And what they would show
was landmark-- take a rat

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:27.920
and put it in an
enriched environment

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:30.860
and-- in 1960s neurobiology,
of a type we've

00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:34.130
heard about already--
you get a thicker cortex.

00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:36.870
People went wild
over that in terms

00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:39.060
of enriching the environment.

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:42.400
This prompted a
gazillion studies

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:47.330
during the '60s built around
this very Great Society '60s

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:48.800
optimism about things.

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:52.050
The Head Start program
emerged during that period

00:14:52.050 --> 00:14:55.106
out of a demonstration that
all sorts of privations

00:14:55.106 --> 00:14:57.640
in various points of
life, early in life,

00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:00.419
could be buffered,
reversed, by the right sort

00:15:00.419 --> 00:15:01.460
of enriched environments.

00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:03.880
Incredibly influential.

00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:05.830
Billions of studies done.

00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:07.380
And hidden away
in the literature

00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:10.410
was one very interesting study.

00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:15.240
Which is, when you took these
enrichment sort of Poobahs

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:17.960
there-- and now, what
they did in this one study

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:20.970
was they studied wild rats.

00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:22.540
And they brought in wild rats.

00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:25.880
And what they saw was, even
without the enrichment--

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:28.340
you didn't need to do a
thing about enrichment.

00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:32.990
You take the best environmental
enrichment laboratory paradigm

00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:35.770
to get you the
thickest cortex around,

00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:39.530
and it's not going to be
as thick as in a wild rat.

00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:43.110
And these guys were not-- these
guys were not ethologists,

00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:45.860
but this is exactly
the sort of thing

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:48.180
that ethology is built around.

00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:51.780
You were not going to be seeing
normal behavior in a cage,

00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:53.510
looking at a rat in there.

00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:56.590
That's like studying dolphins
swimming in a bath tub.

00:15:56.590 --> 00:15:58.990
You are going to be missing
everything under those.

00:15:58.990 --> 00:16:02.560
And, whoa, there is
stuff going on out there.

00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:05.090
If a wild rat has
a thicker cortex

00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:06.790
than we know how
to come up with,

00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:10.010
we need to be studying animals
in their natural setting.

00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:10.510
OK.

00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:13.730
So that was their basic
sort of call to arms.

00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:16.450
What ethologists worked
out were a number

00:16:16.450 --> 00:16:20.900
a very clear experimental
approaches built

00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:25.590
around a whole bunch of the
W questions-- who, and what,

00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:28.770
and where, and why, or whatever
it is we did in fifth grade.

00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:30.120
Here's what they looked at.

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:34.120
They looked at, first,
what was the behavior?

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:35.240
What was the behaviors?

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:37.510
We'll see they had a certain
jargony term for it--

00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:39.160
fixed action patterns.

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:42.920
And what we'll see
about it is this

00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:46.490
is a very specific realm
of types of behavior

00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:50.190
that had a very interesting
subtle relationship with things

00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:51.660
like instinct.

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:52.510
Next.

00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:55.800
What in the outside
world triggered

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:58.060
that behavior to occur?

00:16:58.060 --> 00:17:00.800
And their jargon
stuff, terminology--

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:05.020
what was the environmental
releasing stimulus that

00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:09.750
caused this fixed action
pattern to come out?

00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:10.650
Next.

00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:13.950
Dramatically different from
where the behaviorists were--

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:16.630
what's going on in
that organism's head

00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:21.440
so that that releasing stimulus
triggers the fixed action

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:22.730
pattern to occur?

00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:25.290
What are the
intervening mechanisms?

00:17:25.290 --> 00:17:27.859
What are the innate
releasing mechanism,

00:17:27.859 --> 00:17:29.930
was the jargon
they came up with.

00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:32.590
Very jargony, middle
European stuff.

00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:35.110
But what's going on
in an animal's head?

00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:36.800
What's the behavior?

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:38.990
What triggered it outside there?

00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:42.580
What's the machinery that
took that releasing stimulus

00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:45.140
in the environment and
turned it into the behavior?

00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:47.540
And finally, a realm
which connects them

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:50.760
with evolution type
people, what's the value?

00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:53.580
What's the adaptive
value of that behavior?

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:56.100
And what we'll see
is that question

00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:58.730
meant an utterly different
world to ethologists than it

00:17:58.730 --> 00:18:01.390
did to evolution people.

00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:02.030
OK.

00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:05.000
So starting off, those
fixed action patterns.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.590
Fixed action patterns,
when you first

00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:08.900
begin to learn how
ethologists thought about it,

00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:12.300
you immediately sense they're
talking about instincts.

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:14.230
They're talking about reflexes.

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:15.710
They were definitely not.

00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:20.120
And terms like instinct had
incredibly dirty connotations

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:22.810
among psychologists and animal
behaviorists around that time,

00:18:22.810 --> 00:18:26.590
just because, like an
earlier period, animals,

00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:30.310
humans had instincts
for maternal behavior,

00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:32.600
and instincts for
inevitable aggression,

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:34.810
and instincts for
entrepreneurship,

00:18:34.810 --> 00:18:38.570
and instincts for-- and it was
a totally meaningless term,

00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:41.020
because it described
anything that you wanted

00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:43.600
to say was something
that's supposed to happen

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:45.660
and that I'm good at doing.

00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:48.060
What you had instead,
in their view,

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:50.460
was something much more subtle.

00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:54.290
A fixed action pattern
is not maternalism.

00:18:54.290 --> 00:18:57.370
A fixed action pattern
is not entrepreneurship.

00:18:57.370 --> 00:19:01.480
A fixed action pattern is a
relatively tractable piece

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:06.170
of behavior involving a bunch
of interconnected muscles

00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:09.780
and producing this
characteristic behavior which

00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:12.640
had a meaning to it.

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:13.260
OK.

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:14.290
Nice and abstract.

00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:16.060
We will see example shortly.

00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:19.980
But what they also had, that
separated it from instincts

00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:23.500
by miles and miles,
was animals didn't

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:26.380
have to learn how to do it.

00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:28.770
It was hardwired,
but animals had

00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:31.580
to learn how to do it better.

00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:36.010
And that was an amazing insight
in terms of gene environment

00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:36.780
interactions.

00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:39.640
The word gene was not appearing
in their thinking at the time.

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:41.880
But fixed action patterns.

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:45.420
In other words,
experience could change

00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:48.000
the way you do the
fixed action pattern.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.020
Or, already harking back
to the molecular lecture

00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:55.580
and that obsession with if/then
clauses, what experience mostly

00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:59.280
would do is not so much change
the nature of the fixed action

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:02.200
pattern but change the context.

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:05.960
Teaching you when to
do it, when not to.

00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:10.060
If/then clauses of, if
this environmental event

00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:14.460
is happening, then bring
out this cohesive set

00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:18.030
of behaviors that have at least
some superficial resemblance

00:20:18.030 --> 00:20:20.460
to instinct but doesn't
hold up for long.

00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:21.810
This was really important.

00:20:21.810 --> 00:20:22.460
OK.

00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:23.900
So what would be examples?

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:27.470
What does this look like-- a
behavior where animals simply

00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:30.490
know how to do it without
learning, without experience?

00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:32.800
And they can do it
right from the start

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:35.050
and nonetheless
experience shapes that.

00:20:35.050 --> 00:20:38.530
Obviously, first example was
all of Charlotte's babies

00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:42.020
knowing how to say salutations
within a few seconds of being

00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:42.660
born there.

00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:46.000
And no doubt they would soon
learn who not to say that to.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.800
Classic example.

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:50.650
And this was one that
Lorenz studied for years

00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:54.000
and always wanted to have the
pig killed because Nazi scum.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:54.500
OK.

00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:56.350
But anyway, I digress.

00:20:56.350 --> 00:20:58.030
And other examples.

00:20:58.030 --> 00:20:59.500
You take a squirrel.

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:02.350
You take a squirrel that's
been raised in a cage

00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:04.920
without ever seeing another
squirrel-- a squirrel that

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:08.090
has subsisted on nothing
but a liquid diet

00:21:08.090 --> 00:21:09.640
and that kind of thing.

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:13.450
And give it a nut, and it
will know how to crack it.

00:21:13.450 --> 00:21:16.880
It will know to carry out
this fixed action pattern.

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:20.090
This is not an instinct
for food acquisition.

00:21:20.090 --> 00:21:23.880
This is something instinctual
for how you hold this thing

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:25.700
and where you chew
on it or whatever

00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:27.100
it is that squirrels do.

00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:27.930
It's in there.

00:21:27.930 --> 00:21:31.020
The squirrel doesn't have
to learn how to do it.

00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:33.360
But what you see is,
you take that squirrel

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:36.120
without any prior experience
with nut cracking,

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:40.220
and you look at them over time,
and they get better at it!

00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:41.970
They do it faster.

00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:45.610
They get a larger percentage
of whatever's inside there.

00:21:45.610 --> 00:21:50.220
They have a basic, hardwired
fixed action pattern--

00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:55.010
a bunch of coordinated muscles
doing a coherent set behavior,

00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:57.670
and it is shaped by experience.

00:21:57.670 --> 00:22:01.080
In this case, they learn
how to do it better.

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:02.710
Another example.

00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:07.350
This is one where you have
any of those intro psych books

00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:09.820
from anywhere in
1950s, '60s or so,

00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:12.340
and there was this
inevitable picture where

00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:14.800
you had-- it was this room.

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:20.130
There was this surface, and
it had a checkerboard linoleum

00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:20.780
on it.

00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:22.440
And the surface
came to around here,

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:24.590
and then it dropped
down about three feet

00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:26.540
and then continued the
same on the bottom.

00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:29.250
It was always the same
checkerboard linoleum.

00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:32.694
Linoleum which was like worth
its weight in gold at the time.

00:22:32.694 --> 00:22:35.110
Linoleum which was going to
make life better for everyone.

00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:38.770
So you had this checkered
linoleum thing there.

00:22:38.770 --> 00:22:41.780
And the critical thing
was right around here.

00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:44.760
When the wall dropped
down, right here

00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:48.350
was a sheet of glass
that continued out there.

00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:52.480
In other words, the actual
floor would continue here

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:56.120
on the glass, while it was
also dropping down to this.

00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:58.740
And what was always in
one of those pictures

00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:03.880
would be some adorable, cute
baby animal sitting out there

00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:07.140
on the glass,
totally freaking out.

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:10.840
Because it's out there, and
it's looking way down there,

00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:14.770
and there's stuff-- a yawning
chasm below of three feet--

00:23:14.770 --> 00:23:18.850
and you are eliciting what was
called a visual cliff response.

00:23:18.850 --> 00:23:21.280
Which is, get me out of here!

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:22.910
I'm floating up in the air here.

00:23:22.910 --> 00:23:26.450
You did not have to have animals
who already had experience

00:23:26.450 --> 00:23:29.150
by trial and error
learning that when

00:23:29.150 --> 00:23:32.150
you're floating in the air,
that tends not to last for long.

00:23:32.150 --> 00:23:33.800
And you go to
[INAUDIBLE] afterward.

00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:36.080
There was no-- it's
there in the first place.

00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:38.360
You take a baby dog.

00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:40.000
You take a baby human.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.130
You take a baby blue
whale, whatever.

00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:44.140
And you push them out
on the glass there,

00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:47.630
and they look down, and
they totally freak out.

00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:51.630
Unless they're a baby sloth.

00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:52.790
Oh!

00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:54.400
Isn't that kind of interesting?

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:57.100
Because if you're a baby
sloth who gets freaked out

00:23:57.100 --> 00:23:59.050
by yawning space
underneath you, you

00:23:59.050 --> 00:24:00.930
are not going to be
a very functioning

00:24:00.930 --> 00:24:02.810
sloth when you grow up there.

00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:06.530
Oh, species specific
fixed action patterns. ,

00:24:06.530 --> 00:24:10.840
Where in this case, this visual
cliff could evoke this whole

00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:14.710
fixed action pattern of
panic responses, all of that.

00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:16.600
So where does the
learning come in?

00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:19.170
You push this poor
animal out there enough

00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:21.510
times-- the 40th time,
the elephant's out there,

00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:24.060
and it begins to learn.

00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:25.550
I don't know what's
up with this,

00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:28.650
because this gravity business
is making sense otherwise.

00:24:28.650 --> 00:24:31.670
But it seems to be
OK when I'm out here.

00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:35.060
You could habituate the
visual cliff response.

00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:39.880
But all sorts of animals--
except for arboreal ones

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:42.490
hanging up there--
all sorts of species

00:24:42.490 --> 00:24:46.180
didn't have to have prior
experience with not liking

00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:48.270
to drop down open spaces.

00:24:48.270 --> 00:24:49.820
It was there already.

00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:52.580
They learn the context better.

00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:56.370
Another example of this
that the ethologists showed.

00:24:56.370 --> 00:24:57.830
These were with
captive primates.

00:24:57.830 --> 00:25:00.495
You take a monkey who
was raised in isolation,

00:25:00.495 --> 00:25:03.060
who has never seen
another monkey,

00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:05.130
and at some point
in adolescence.

00:25:05.130 --> 00:25:06.380
It's a male monkey.

00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:11.040
And you sit him down,
and you show him a film.

00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:13.340
And the film
consists of the face

00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:18.350
of a huge, scary male monkey
of the same species giving

00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:20.610
a threatening display,
which is usually

00:25:20.610 --> 00:25:22.630
displaying the canines there.

00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:27.140
And this is a monkey who has no
prior experience with monkeys.

00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:29.140
It has never seen
a monkey before.

00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:32.300
All of its interactions have
been with Barney or whatever,

00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:34.240
knows nothing about any of this.

00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:37.620
And you show it that, and
it will freak out and give

00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:41.130
a fixed action pattern--
a subordinate gesture

00:25:41.130 --> 00:25:44.650
crouching down and not
making eye contact.

00:25:44.650 --> 00:25:45.530
Whoa!

00:25:45.530 --> 00:25:46.990
Where'd that come from?

00:25:46.990 --> 00:25:49.700
No learning from
trial and error.

00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:52.640
It was simply there as
a fixed action pattern--

00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:54.520
a whole bunch of
things that the monkey

00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:57.900
does with its torso,
its face, all of that.

00:25:57.900 --> 00:26:00.140
Where does experience come in?

00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:03.360
The monkey needs to learn
that you give a subordinating

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:06.610
gesture like that to
some big, scary animal,

00:26:06.610 --> 00:26:08.230
you don't give it to infants.

00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:11.910
It needs to learn the
right social context.

00:26:11.910 --> 00:26:13.750
So that's where it comes in.

00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:17.160
So you've got all these
examples of behaviors that are

00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:19.880
hardwired, whatever that means.

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:23.590
And what you have, nonetheless,
is shaping by experience.

00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:25.670
And this is what the
ethologists learned.

00:26:25.670 --> 00:26:28.260
And what was clear after
awhile was all sorts of animals

00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:30.550
already knew all about ethology.

00:26:30.550 --> 00:26:33.540
They understood what a
fixed action pattern was.

00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:34.750
As follows.

00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:38.110
Type of monkey in East
Africa called vervet monkeys.

00:26:38.110 --> 00:26:40.860
If you were a vervet monkey,
there are three things on Earth

00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:42.030
that terrify you.

00:26:42.030 --> 00:26:44.400
One is a leopard.

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:48.950
Another is a snake, and
the third is an eagle.

00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:51.080
Leopards come from below.

00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:52.650
Snakes come from below.

00:26:52.650 --> 00:26:54.310
Eagles come from above.

00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:56.060
And what you have
in vervet monkeys

00:26:56.060 --> 00:26:59.790
are fixed action
patterns of alarm calls

00:26:59.790 --> 00:27:02.210
that they give when spotting
one of the predators.

00:27:02.210 --> 00:27:05.960
They have different alarm
calls for each of the species.

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:09.540
And what has been
shown is, you fly over

00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:12.960
the silhouette of a
perfectly nice bird there

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:14.760
that's not going to
try to carry it away,

00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:16.020
and you don't elicit it.

00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:18.530
It's not just things
going on up there.

00:27:18.530 --> 00:27:23.050
It's a fixed action pattern
for scary, terrifying stuff up

00:27:23.050 --> 00:27:27.070
above verses scary, terrifying
stuff below with four legs,

00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:30.610
versus scary, terrifying
below with no legs at all.

00:27:30.610 --> 00:27:34.580
And they all know how to do
this without prior experience.

00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:37.520
But what goes on
is the same thing

00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:39.450
that makes it a fixed
action pattern, which

00:27:39.450 --> 00:27:42.860
is it can be sculpted
by experience.

00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:44.360
What am I saying here?

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:46.990
Which is, you are a
young vervet monkey,

00:27:46.990 --> 00:27:49.460
and you've got these
fixed action patterns.

00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:50.470
That's great!

00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:54.530
What you have to learn how to
do, though, is not screw up

00:27:54.530 --> 00:27:57.710
and say, oh my god, there's an
eagle, when you actually should

00:27:57.710 --> 00:27:59.210
be saying, there's a leopard.

00:27:59.210 --> 00:28:01.270
Because if you say,
there's an eagle,

00:28:01.270 --> 00:28:03.094
everyone's going to
run down the tree.

00:28:03.094 --> 00:28:04.510
And if you say,
there's a leopard,

00:28:04.510 --> 00:28:06.300
everybody's going
to run up the tree!

00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:09.350
And you get some kid
who gets it backwards,

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:11.810
and that's going to have
some bad consequences.

00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:15.550
How do you know adult vervet
monkeys have studied ethology

00:28:15.550 --> 00:28:16.970
and fixed action patterns?

00:28:16.970 --> 00:28:19.340
Because they don't
listen to the kid

00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:22.860
until some adult agrees
with them, because they know

00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:26.530
this is some dumbass kid that
doesn't know the language yet

00:28:26.530 --> 00:28:29.300
very well and makes mistakes.

00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:31.940
Under a certain
age, adult vervets

00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:35.220
don't respond to alarm calls
other than with vigilance,

00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:37.710
trying to figure out what
the kid's talking about,

00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:41.370
until it is seconded
by an adult.

00:28:41.370 --> 00:28:44.010
So what about fixed
action patterns in humans?

00:28:44.010 --> 00:28:47.440
Classic example--
infant smiling,

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:51.060
involving all sorts
of muscles that who

00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:52.650
knows what's involved in them?

00:28:52.650 --> 00:28:55.220
All sorts of muscles
that produce this

00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:57.280
without prior experience.

00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:58.430
How do you know?

00:28:58.430 --> 00:29:02.000
Fiberoptic mysteries
show that fetuses

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.030
smile at various points.

00:29:04.030 --> 00:29:04.880
What else?

00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:07.880
You will see smiling
in blind babies.

00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:10.770
So there's no visual
information coming in.

00:29:10.770 --> 00:29:11.840
What's smiling?

00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:13.050
It's a fixed action pattern.

00:29:13.050 --> 00:29:14.220
Where's the learning?

00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:16.470
Learning who to smile at.

00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:19.150
Learning that mannequins
aren't going to smile back

00:29:19.150 --> 00:29:21.020
at you and things of that sort.

00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:23.710
That's it being
shaped by experience.

00:29:23.710 --> 00:29:26.330
More fixed action patterns.

00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:31.000
Infants are not having to have
trial and error experience

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.000
with learning there's this thing
you do with your mouth right

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.490
after you're born that keeps
you from being really, really

00:29:36.490 --> 00:29:38.826
hungry, and it's called nursing.

00:29:38.826 --> 00:29:41.010
Oh, can somebody
demonstrate that for me?

00:29:41.010 --> 00:29:42.750
That's a fixed action pattern.

00:29:42.750 --> 00:29:46.630
What happens is, kids get more
and more efficient at it--

00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:49.960
the number of calories they
can consume per unit of time.

00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:51.900
They get better at doing it.

00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:54.280
More fixed action
patterns in humans.

00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:57.480
Every culture on earth,
people raising their eyebrows

00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:59.040
and greeting to somebody.

00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:01.050
Every culture on
earth, people can

00:30:01.050 --> 00:30:04.570
recognize what anger looks
like, what fear looks like,

00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:07.250
what disgust, what
contempt, all of those.

00:30:07.250 --> 00:30:09.610
These are all fixed
action patterns.

00:30:09.610 --> 00:30:11.480
And where does the
context come in?

00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:15.120
With all of them obviously
learning when you interpret

00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:16.860
this as good news, bad news.

00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:19.640
When you pretend you
don't see it, all of that.

00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:21.690
Learning the social context.

00:30:21.690 --> 00:30:25.510
So humans are absolutely full
of fixed action patterns.

00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:28.610
Next, the next sort of question
that the ethologists would

00:30:28.610 --> 00:30:30.770
ask after getting
to this point of,

00:30:30.770 --> 00:30:34.490
what's the behavior-- what does
learning have to do with it?

00:30:34.490 --> 00:30:37.550
And now asking the
question-- the same one

00:30:37.550 --> 00:30:40.120
the evolutionary folks
would ask-- which is, well,

00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:41.400
what's the benefit of it?

00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:43.600
What's the adaptive value?

00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:45.810
And a totally different
way of thinking about it

00:30:45.810 --> 00:30:47.310
than the evolution people.

00:30:47.310 --> 00:30:50.260
The evolution folks going
on with adaptive value,

00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:53.770
which is it allows you to pass
on more copies of your genes.

00:30:53.770 --> 00:30:56.217
And over the generations,
the prevalence of that trait

00:30:56.217 --> 00:30:57.050
becomes more common.

00:30:57.050 --> 00:31:00.470
What the ethologists did
instead were experiments.

00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:04.230
They simply went and
experimented to see what

00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:06.430
this information--
what these fixed action

00:31:06.430 --> 00:31:08.910
patterns-- actually meant.

00:31:08.910 --> 00:31:11.640
So Tinbergen was famous
for one of those.

00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:15.580
Which was there was like
some gull something or other

00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:18.870
that he would study, and
the outside of gull eggs

00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:20.260
were all speckled.

00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:22.730
And there would be this very
distinctive fixed action

00:31:22.730 --> 00:31:25.060
pattern shortly after
the chicks pop out,

00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:28.480
which is mom would go around
systematically turning over

00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:32.250
all the fragments of egg
where the white of egg shell--

00:31:32.250 --> 00:31:34.750
where the white was facing
up-- and would turn it

00:31:34.750 --> 00:31:38.580
over so that the speckled
part was facing up.

00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:39.479
Whoa!

00:31:39.479 --> 00:31:40.770
That's an interesting behavior.

00:31:40.770 --> 00:31:43.450
Does that make that gull
more attractive to males

00:31:43.450 --> 00:31:45.940
and thus pass on more
copies of her genes?

00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:49.250
But, no, here's
what Tinbergen does.

00:31:49.250 --> 00:31:52.150
He goes in with these gulls
who just finished doing it

00:31:52.150 --> 00:31:56.760
and with her new pups,
chicks-- her new chicks

00:31:56.760 --> 00:31:58.040
just having hatched.

00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:00.400
And she goes off to get
them food or whatever.

00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:04.860
And this total vicious,
heartless Tinbergen sneaks in,

00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:07.920
and he turns the shells
back over to white.

00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:09.040
And what happens?

00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:11.630
All sorts of raptors
flying around up

00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:14.510
there are better at spotting
down there that there's

00:32:14.510 --> 00:32:18.310
all these baby chicks, who
are gone by the time mom

00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:19.240
comes back.

00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:19.890
Tragically.

00:32:19.890 --> 00:32:22.220
I know!

00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:24.280
And I'm complaining
about Lorenz?

00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:25.590
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:26.090
OK.

00:32:26.090 --> 00:32:29.790
But that's showing, oh, why
do gull mothers, shortly

00:32:29.790 --> 00:32:32.480
after giving birth, go through
this interesting collection

00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:35.230
of motoric movements which they
don't have to learn how to do,

00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:36.700
flipping these things over?

00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:39.030
Does this make
their groups better

00:32:39.030 --> 00:32:41.760
to out-compete those with
the next Ice Age comes?

00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:42.630
No.

00:32:42.630 --> 00:32:44.910
It's because you turn it
over so that some predator

00:32:44.910 --> 00:32:46.590
up there in the sky
can't see the egg

00:32:46.590 --> 00:32:49.500
shells-- the adaptive value.

00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:50.240
Next.

00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:52.020
Next example of
this-- and this is

00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:55.320
like one of the most famous,
iconic sort of stories

00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:57.300
to come out of
ethology-- this was

00:32:57.300 --> 00:33:03.350
the work of Von Frisch showing
bee dancing, bee communication.

00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:06.990
And what bees are about
is-- they're scary,

00:33:06.990 --> 00:33:09.540
and they go find out
about food sources.

00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:11.870
And they fly back
to their colony.

00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:15.190
And what they need to do is
communicate to everybody else

00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:17.470
that they have
found a food source.

00:33:17.470 --> 00:33:21.090
And they have to communicate all
sorts of types of information.

00:33:21.090 --> 00:33:22.900
Which direction?

00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:24.480
How far?

00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:25.690
How much?

00:33:25.690 --> 00:33:28.680
Is it totally exciting,
or is it, I just stumbled

00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:29.680
into a little bit?

00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:32.000
And what Von Frisch
was able to work out

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.530
was bees came back and did
this fixed action pattern

00:33:35.530 --> 00:33:38.760
movement which has been seen
in every bee species on Earth.

00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:42.380
Which is, they do this
figure eight, a waggle dance.

00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:44.720
They're shaking their
rear back and forth.

00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:46.700
And they're moving
over the floor

00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:49.300
of the hive, where everybody
is watching and cheering them

00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:52.400
on, and going around and
doing this figure eight.

00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:54.200
And what is this about?

00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:56.670
What is this about?

00:33:56.670 --> 00:33:59.080
Von Frisch was
able to dissect it,

00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:03.320
and with brilliant, experimental
tricks showing the bee

00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:05.780
was giving three
pieces of information.

00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:09.580
The axis of the figure
eight told the bees,

00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:11.989
with respect to
sunlight, which direction

00:34:11.989 --> 00:34:14.820
to go to find the source.

00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:18.920
The longer the bee danced, the
further away the food source

00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:20.150
was.

00:34:20.150 --> 00:34:23.679
And the more frantically it
was wiggling its rear around,

00:34:23.679 --> 00:34:26.739
the more exciting of
a food source it was.

00:34:26.739 --> 00:34:28.659
This was information.

00:34:28.659 --> 00:34:30.440
This was what's
the adaptive value.

00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:33.006
So Von Frisch is sitting
there saying, well, I

00:34:33.006 --> 00:34:34.880
think it might mean
this, because I'm finding

00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:36.230
this interesting pattern.

00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:37.205
I may speculate.

00:34:37.205 --> 00:34:37.830
What do you do?

00:34:37.830 --> 00:34:39.659
You do an experiment instead.

00:34:39.659 --> 00:34:41.980
Which is, now you
take a beehive,

00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:46.310
and you put it on
a bar stool thing.

00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:48.510
And it's sitting out
there in the field,

00:34:48.510 --> 00:34:50.236
and you grab some bee.

00:34:50.236 --> 00:34:52.860
And I don't know how he did it,
but he lived to a ripe old age.

00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:56.429
But you grab a bee, and you
give it some amazing food

00:34:56.429 --> 00:35:00.060
source out here, and you
let it fly back to the hive

00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:02.890
where it goes berserk with
the waggle dance stuff,

00:35:02.890 --> 00:35:06.320
telling everybody there's
something amazing over there.

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:09.160
Meanwhile, Von Frisch,
in his hiking boots,

00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:12.240
is slithering on his
belly towards the beehive

00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:14.840
with the piano stool, and
comes up underneath it,

00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:19.200
and rotates it--
rotates it 180 degrees.

00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:20.890
And what happens then?

00:35:20.890 --> 00:35:23.350
Everybody in the hive
comes barreling out

00:35:23.350 --> 00:35:25.000
and goes in the wrong direction!

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.120
Because they were
given directions

00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:30.880
as to where to go with respect
to the hive's entrance.

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:34.260
That's how you show it
actually contained information.

00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:36.980
And then he would have the
food source closer or further,

00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:38.660
and show the length
of the dancing

00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:40.420
and all sorts of
other cruel things

00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:43.140
he would do to the hive to
confuse them and wipe out

00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:44.950
the credibility of that one bee.

00:35:44.950 --> 00:35:47.820
But this is how you
get the information.

00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:50.190
He would show this
explicitly-- oh,

00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:54.190
why do they do this fascinating
fixed action pattern?

00:35:54.190 --> 00:35:56.320
Because they're
telling them something!

00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:57.960
And here's how you prove it.

00:35:57.960 --> 00:35:59.640
And you rotate it around.

00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:02.700
So you can begin to see
the ethologists were really

00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:05.170
good, clever experimentalists.

00:36:05.170 --> 00:36:06.960
And they were just
trying to do it

00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:09.800
in the animal's own language.

00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:13.660
This became really clear when
you study their next category

00:36:13.660 --> 00:36:16.440
of questions-- that
business of, well, what

00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:19.400
is it that just happened
in the outside world that

00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:22.390
triggered this fixed
action pattern to occur?

00:36:22.390 --> 00:36:25.130
What was the sensory trigger?

00:36:25.130 --> 00:36:28.120
Their jargon-- what was
the releasing stimulus?

00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:31.091
And they had general
strategies for doing this.

00:36:31.091 --> 00:36:31.590
OK.

00:36:31.590 --> 00:36:34.990
You were speculating
that this site

00:36:34.990 --> 00:36:37.030
is the thing that
triggers whatever

00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:38.770
this behavior in this animal.

00:36:38.770 --> 00:36:40.410
How do you begin to test it?

00:36:40.410 --> 00:36:43.740
Let's remove the-- OK, enough
with the abstract stuff.

00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:47.730
Baby birds-- baby
gulls or something--

00:36:47.730 --> 00:36:50.790
peck at mom's
mouth, at her beak.

00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:55.590
And that is meant to get mom to
regurgitate some exciting food.

00:36:55.590 --> 00:36:57.260
How do they know how to do this?

00:36:57.260 --> 00:36:59.580
What is it that gets
them to do this behavior?

00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:02.800
On mom's beak, there's
a little red circle.

00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:05.886
And the early ethologists
noting that, oh,

00:37:05.886 --> 00:37:07.010
that's kind of interesting.

00:37:07.010 --> 00:37:09.290
I wonder if they're looking
at the red circle there?

00:37:09.290 --> 00:37:11.130
I wonder if that's the
thing that's causing

00:37:11.130 --> 00:37:13.070
them to start this behavior?

00:37:13.070 --> 00:37:16.490
What were the experimental
techniques for saying, oh,

00:37:16.490 --> 00:37:21.320
is a red circle on mom's
beak a releasing stimulus

00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:23.690
for this fixed action
pattern of pecking?

00:37:23.690 --> 00:37:25.610
Let's do an experiment.

00:37:25.610 --> 00:37:27.500
And the standard
experimental models

00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:31.980
they would have would be to
subtract out the thing that you

00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:33.420
think is the stimulus.

00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:36.330
Take mom and white out
her little red circle

00:37:36.330 --> 00:37:39.250
there and see if the
kids no longer peck.

00:37:39.250 --> 00:37:40.670
Replacement.

00:37:40.670 --> 00:37:42.880
Which is, now you've
done that to mom.

00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:44.880
And you draw a little
red circle back,

00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:47.860
and you see if they
start pecking again.

00:37:47.860 --> 00:37:50.740
Replacement substitution.

00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:52.700
Now you take something
completely different.

00:37:52.700 --> 00:37:56.890
You put some neon
triangle on mom's beak,

00:37:56.890 --> 00:37:59.380
and you see if you will
elicit the same-- oh, what's

00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:00.990
the specificity of it?

00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:03.230
Finally, the thing
that they really

00:38:03.230 --> 00:38:05.070
specialized in--
which is now you

00:38:05.070 --> 00:38:07.400
would do what they
called super stimulation.

00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:10.220
Which is, you wave a piece of
paper in front of the chick

00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:13.460
there-- that you've drawn
a gigantic red circle on--

00:38:13.460 --> 00:38:16.080
and you see if it goes out
of its mind and pecks at it

00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:17.540
like there's no tomorrow.

00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:19.810
Experimental
approaches like this.

00:38:19.810 --> 00:38:23.030
If you take away this thing,
does the fixed action pattern

00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:23.940
no longer occur?

00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:25.680
If you put it back,
does it work again?

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:27.890
If you replace it
with something else,

00:38:27.890 --> 00:38:29.960
if you exaggerate
the traits, do you

00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:31.790
get even more of the behavior?

00:38:31.790 --> 00:38:34.080
These were the
standard approaches

00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:35.470
for figuring this out.

00:38:35.470 --> 00:38:37.760
And ethology types
who were interested

00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:40.050
in this realm of
releasing stimuli,

00:38:40.050 --> 00:38:43.310
the thing they have gotten
incredible mileage out

00:38:43.310 --> 00:38:47.140
of recent years is making
little robotic animals.

00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:50.220
Because you could program
to do certain behaviors,

00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:53.330
and you could see if you
could elicit everybody else

00:38:53.330 --> 00:38:54.850
to respond to the behaviors.

00:38:54.850 --> 00:38:57.360
And, of course, the
first ones were all sorts

00:38:57.360 --> 00:39:01.070
of techie folks building
robotic bees who could

00:39:01.070 --> 00:39:03.270
dance in certain dimensions.

00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:05.020
And they would
stick him in there

00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:07.710
and wind up the
gear shaft thing.

00:39:07.710 --> 00:39:10.060
And they would just
dance away, and they

00:39:10.060 --> 00:39:12.530
could get the other
bees to go flying off

00:39:12.530 --> 00:39:15.440
someplace-- the bees not
being very discriminating as

00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:17.640
to which dancers they
pay attention to.

00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:21.670
But the point there was,
this was a substitution--

00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:26.720
a mechanical substitution
for that releasing stimulus.

00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:29.670
Or there's some amazing
paper a couple years ago,

00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:32.370
where somebody made
a robotic cockroach

00:39:32.370 --> 00:39:35.670
and was able to trick all the
other cockroaches into doing

00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:37.660
some sort of imprudent behavior.

00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:41.500
And so you see this is high
tech versions of this approach.

00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:45.180
Oh, it might be this stimulus
that's-- let's replicate it.

00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:47.280
Let's make it even
more exciting.

00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:49.420
So using this approach,
the ethologists

00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:51.550
would begin to figure
out, what is it

00:39:51.550 --> 00:39:54.740
in the sensory world of this
animal that caused that fixed

00:39:54.740 --> 00:39:56.110
action pattern to occur?

00:39:56.110 --> 00:39:58.830
And it was never more
than in this domain

00:39:58.830 --> 00:40:02.220
that they were doing that whole
sound byte about interviewing

00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:03.710
an animal in its own language.

00:40:03.710 --> 00:40:07.810
Because what it's all about is
recognizing other species out

00:40:07.810 --> 00:40:10.700
there are functioning
in sensory modalities

00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:12.920
we can't even guess at.

00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:14.750
What they began to see.

00:40:14.750 --> 00:40:18.600
One example-- the sorts
of auditory stimuli

00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:20.970
that would trigger
fixed action patterns.

00:40:20.970 --> 00:40:23.900
One example-- deer moose.

00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:28.050
Big things.

00:40:28.050 --> 00:40:29.710
What are they called?

00:40:29.710 --> 00:40:30.800
Elk!

00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:32.380
Elk!

00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:35.970
Is elk a female
name for-- bulls.

00:40:35.970 --> 00:40:36.480
OK.

00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:40.950
So you get Bullwinkles there.

00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:45.300
And what he's doing is he
is trying to find a mate.

00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:46.670
And how does he do it?

00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:49.850
What they do, when they use
northern Minnesotan beasts,

00:40:49.850 --> 00:40:51.900
is they bellow.

00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:53.870
They give these
bellowing calls that

00:40:53.870 --> 00:40:55.660
are heard for miles and miles.

00:40:55.660 --> 00:40:57.520
Male deer-- I guess it's deer.

00:40:57.520 --> 00:40:58.020
OK.

00:40:58.020 --> 00:40:58.635
They bellow.

00:40:58.635 --> 00:41:01.040
It could be heard miles away.

00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:03.390
And if you were the
right kind of female,

00:41:03.390 --> 00:41:06.380
and you hear some guy
bellowing in the next valley,

00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:07.980
do you know what you do?

00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:10.160
You ovulate.

00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:13.040
Auditory induced ovulation.

00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:16.317
And not only that, you begin
to go try to find the guy.

00:41:16.317 --> 00:41:18.150
And when you get there,
you start this whole

00:41:18.150 --> 00:41:21.350
courting display thing, if
he's the right kind of guy

00:41:21.350 --> 00:41:23.380
and he expresses himself.

00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:26.960
And what you have there is--
what's the releasing stimulus?

00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:29.240
An auditory one.

00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:33.680
Even more bizarre--
discovering that rats,

00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:37.330
rats are responsive to
certain types of stimuli.

00:41:37.330 --> 00:41:40.290
For example, you tickle
them on their rib cage,

00:41:40.290 --> 00:41:42.710
and they giggle.

00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:43.310
Yes!

00:41:43.310 --> 00:41:47.570
Your tax dollars going on that
that could instead be spent

00:41:47.570 --> 00:41:49.750
on nuking something or other.

00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:51.810
What you've got
there is rats giggle.

00:41:51.810 --> 00:41:54.740
They giggle in an
ultrasonic range.

00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:57.450
So you can't hear it until
you've got some rat giggle

00:41:57.450 --> 00:41:58.780
decoder thing.

00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:01.277
And they giggle in
response to logical things.

00:42:01.277 --> 00:42:02.860
Like you tickle them,
and they giggle.

00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:04.790
And then they come
back for more.

00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:07.050
And you show all those
patterns with it.

00:42:07.050 --> 00:42:09.630
And if you get it at the
right frequency only,

00:42:09.630 --> 00:42:12.120
and they do this
giggling chirping thing,

00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:15.560
and you're releasing that
there, and other rats

00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:17.430
come over to check it out.

00:42:17.430 --> 00:42:21.490
Because the sound-- the
auditory releasing stimulus,

00:42:21.490 --> 00:42:25.160
in this case of rat chirping
giggling-- induces this,

00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:27.010
whoa, let's go see
where the party

00:42:27.010 --> 00:42:29.100
is response in the other rats.

00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:31.940
Another example of
this-- interesting thing

00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:34.350
that you see in various
species, including

00:42:34.350 --> 00:42:37.890
humans-- which is when
females are ovulating,

00:42:37.890 --> 00:42:40.420
their voices go a little higher.

00:42:40.420 --> 00:42:45.910
And studies showing that males
subliminally can detect this.

00:42:45.910 --> 00:42:50.470
More evidence of modality
supplying information we

00:42:50.470 --> 00:42:52.710
would never even guess at.

00:42:52.710 --> 00:42:53.580
OK.

00:42:53.580 --> 00:42:57.720
Then you can show releasing
stimuli in the visual domain.

00:42:57.720 --> 00:43:01.600
And one example of this
is that you have turkeys,

00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:04.880
and turkeys apparently do
their sexual attraction stuff

00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:05.870
visually.

00:43:05.870 --> 00:43:09.750
And this prompted one of the
cruelest, most savage studies

00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:12.340
I've ever seen, which
is trying to figure out

00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:15.710
what is it that
makes female turkeys

00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:17.750
attractive to male turkeys.

00:43:17.750 --> 00:43:20.680
And what they did was,
they would show the male,

00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:24.400
and they studied his
behavior for a long period.

00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:26.140
And the scientists
began to guess

00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:29.300
at what were the releasing
stimuli, the visual information

00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:32.230
from the female, that
would elicit this behavior?

00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:36.770
So they did the subtraction
substitution technique.

00:43:36.770 --> 00:43:40.100
They made themselves an
artificial female turkey.

00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:43.110
They took a big old
ball of Styrofoam,

00:43:43.110 --> 00:43:46.640
and they stuck this fake
turkey head on at one end.

00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:48.740
And they stuck a bunch
of feathery things

00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:51.640
at the other end and just stuck
it out there in the field.

00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:53.650
And, of course, the
idiot male turkeys

00:43:53.650 --> 00:43:56.760
instantly are like all around
the thing and courting it.

00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:58.630
And all, oh.

00:43:58.630 --> 00:44:00.980
So interesting visual stimuli.

00:44:00.980 --> 00:44:04.220
What about it actually
attracts the male?

00:44:04.220 --> 00:44:06.850
And here's where
the cruelty came in.

00:44:06.850 --> 00:44:10.180
They would begin to mess
with the artificial females.

00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:11.840
And I once saw a film of this.

00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:16.740
And like the empathy you feel
for this poor turkey guy there.

00:44:16.740 --> 00:44:19.010
Because they have a--
and he comes in there,

00:44:19.010 --> 00:44:22.540
and they've got the Styrofoam
female with this stuff there,

00:44:22.540 --> 00:44:24.892
and he's courting it
and having a great time.

00:44:24.892 --> 00:44:26.600
And now they put him
back there, and they

00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:27.840
do something or other there.

00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:31.310
And he comes out,
and the back feathers

00:44:31.310 --> 00:44:34.010
are kind of perpendicular
to the head.

00:44:34.010 --> 00:44:38.060
And that doesn't-- so you see
he sort of stops there and kind

00:44:38.060 --> 00:44:39.520
of circles around for a bit.

00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:41.540
But, being a male, he
decides what the hell

00:44:41.540 --> 00:44:43.260
and starts courting the thing.

00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:46.510
Then they put him back
in the room there.

00:44:46.510 --> 00:44:47.930
And now they let him out.

00:44:47.930 --> 00:44:51.230
And the tail and the head
are on the same side.

00:44:51.230 --> 00:44:53.340
He stands there, looking
a little more confused,

00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:55.640
before starting to
court the thing.

00:44:55.640 --> 00:45:00.220
Put him away, come back in,
and the head is over there,

00:45:00.220 --> 00:45:02.690
and the feathers are there,
and the Styrofoam ball.

00:45:02.690 --> 00:45:04.890
And you see he's kind
of like looking around

00:45:04.890 --> 00:45:08.180
and goes up to this and-- well,
that's not going to work--

00:45:08.180 --> 00:45:09.470
and goes over to the next one.

00:45:09.470 --> 00:45:12.180
And you're seeing what
the information-- can you

00:45:12.180 --> 00:45:13.880
believe how cruel this was?

00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:16.960
You could begin to see this
sort of information-- what

00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:20.810
were the building blocks of
that visual releasing stimulus--

00:45:20.810 --> 00:45:23.340
in order to find out about that.

00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:26.660
Then there is, not
surprisingly, a whole world

00:45:26.660 --> 00:45:29.210
of olfactory releasing stimuli.

00:45:29.210 --> 00:45:31.040
And we won't spend
any time on that

00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:33.170
here, because all
that stuff is going

00:45:33.170 --> 00:45:36.670
to come big time in the
lectures on sexual behavior--

00:45:36.670 --> 00:45:40.760
pheromones, information
that triggers behaviors,

00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:44.670
sexual behaviors in all sorts
of species, including humans.

00:45:44.670 --> 00:45:46.440
Olfactory information.

00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:47.910
One example with
humans, which was

00:45:47.910 --> 00:45:50.890
this very cool study that was
published a couple of months

00:45:50.890 --> 00:45:51.390
ago.

00:45:51.390 --> 00:45:56.480
What you need is sweat
from terrified people.

00:45:56.480 --> 00:45:57.550
So here's what you do.

00:45:57.550 --> 00:45:59.920
You throw somebody
out of an airplane

00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:02.212
who's never parachuted before.

00:46:02.212 --> 00:46:03.670
And the whole thing
is, I guess you

00:46:03.670 --> 00:46:07.220
can do your first jump in
tandem with the instructor who's

00:46:07.220 --> 00:46:09.950
attached to you and
who knows what to do.

00:46:09.950 --> 00:46:12.930
The instructor who's doing
all the physical work

00:46:12.930 --> 00:46:15.850
while you're just there attached
to them being scared out

00:46:15.850 --> 00:46:17.310
of your pants.

00:46:17.310 --> 00:46:20.270
Then you get a control
group-- a control group

00:46:20.270 --> 00:46:24.750
who, instead, have generated
stress sweat on an exercise

00:46:24.750 --> 00:46:25.580
bicycle.

00:46:25.580 --> 00:46:26.540
Totally fine.

00:46:26.540 --> 00:46:29.050
So quick, you get the guys
lying down in the field.

00:46:29.050 --> 00:46:30.190
They're hyperventilating.

00:46:30.190 --> 00:46:32.130
You run at them
with cotton swabs,

00:46:32.130 --> 00:46:35.110
and push his armpits into it,
and get some of his sweat,

00:46:35.110 --> 00:46:36.020
and seal it away.

00:46:36.020 --> 00:46:37.890
And then you get the
person on the bicycle,

00:46:37.890 --> 00:46:39.223
and you get some of their sweat.

00:46:39.223 --> 00:46:41.400
And now you sit
down people, and you

00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:45.560
let them smell the two sources.

00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:49.190
Objectively, people cannot
distinguish between them.

00:46:49.190 --> 00:46:51.770
Put the person in
a brain scanner,

00:46:51.770 --> 00:46:53.120
and give them the odors.

00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:55.820
And if they're smelling the
sweat from the terrified

00:46:55.820 --> 00:46:59.060
person, their
amygdala activates.

00:46:59.060 --> 00:47:02.250
Not if you smell the sweat
from the other individual.

00:47:02.250 --> 00:47:05.170
And not only that,
you now show them

00:47:05.170 --> 00:47:08.450
faces where the facial
expression is ambiguous.

00:47:08.450 --> 00:47:13.150
It's been sort of merged halfway
between a scared appearance

00:47:13.150 --> 00:47:15.740
and a happy one, between
different facial expressions.

00:47:15.740 --> 00:47:17.180
And you get somebody
after they've

00:47:17.180 --> 00:47:19.760
smelled the scared
sweat, and they interpret

00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:23.480
faces as more frightened.

00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:24.270
Whoa!

00:47:24.270 --> 00:47:25.310
Smells?

00:47:25.310 --> 00:47:28.290
The smells of people's armpits
and whether they were terrified

00:47:28.290 --> 00:47:31.050
or not changes how
your brain is working

00:47:31.050 --> 00:47:35.390
and changes how you judge
pictures of facial expressions.

00:47:35.390 --> 00:47:39.130
We've got stuff going on in
all sorts of sensory domains

00:47:39.130 --> 00:47:42.380
that we can't even
begin to guess at.

00:47:42.380 --> 00:47:45.920
Showing this even more, other
species where you go into stuff

00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:47.430
we don't even know about.

00:47:47.430 --> 00:47:49.190
Electric fish.

00:47:49.190 --> 00:47:53.320
You want to understand releasing
stimuli for electric fish,

00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:55.890
you've got to
understand electricity,

00:47:55.890 --> 00:48:00.020
and how they sing to each
other in electric fish songs,

00:48:00.020 --> 00:48:03.370
and how they-- where
is that coming from?

00:48:03.370 --> 00:48:06.160
Oh, right, they're singing
to each other in electricity.

00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:09.360
And, yes, you get
territorial songs.

00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:11.130
You get specific ones.

00:48:11.130 --> 00:48:14.690
You get males who are
courting the same female,

00:48:14.690 --> 00:48:17.670
trying to jam each
other's frequencies.

00:48:17.670 --> 00:48:20.320
This actually is
demonstrated quite readily.

00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:26.240
You see relatedness of frequency
patterns between siblings.

00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:28.660
They're going about
this with electricity.

00:48:28.660 --> 00:48:29.520
Whoa!

00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:31.370
What is happening
in the outside world

00:48:31.370 --> 00:48:33.810
there that we haven't
a clue at interviewing

00:48:33.810 --> 00:48:36.380
an animal in its own language?

00:48:36.380 --> 00:48:37.790
Vibration.

00:48:37.790 --> 00:48:41.880
All sorts of insects communicate
with each other by vibrating.

00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:45.239
Arachnids, there's all sorts of
things where they communicate--

00:48:45.239 --> 00:48:47.030
I don't know what they
want to talk about--

00:48:47.030 --> 00:48:48.760
but by vibrating a web.

00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:50.990
They can produce
distinctive patterns of it,

00:48:50.990 --> 00:48:52.560
which sends information.

00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:56.020
And oh, OK, weirdo insects
and spiders and stuff.

00:48:56.020 --> 00:48:59.120
Really interesting work
done in recent years,

00:48:59.120 --> 00:49:02.310
by somebody who used to be
here on campus named Caitlin

00:49:02.310 --> 00:49:06.090
O'Connell-Rodwell,
looking at elephants.

00:49:06.090 --> 00:49:09.100
And it turns out
elephants have all sorts

00:49:09.100 --> 00:49:12.900
of interesting pressure
transducer receptor

00:49:12.900 --> 00:49:17.490
little corpuscle
thingies in their feet.

00:49:17.490 --> 00:49:20.174
Nobody else has stuff like that
in their feet among mammals.

00:49:20.174 --> 00:49:21.840
These are things that
are supposed to be

00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:22.780
in other parts of the body.

00:49:22.780 --> 00:49:24.830
You don't see them at
the bottom of your feet.

00:49:24.830 --> 00:49:26.660
And what are these about?

00:49:26.660 --> 00:49:31.880
When an elephant walks,
it's causing tiny, tiny bits

00:49:31.880 --> 00:49:34.490
of vibration in the ground
that could be picked up

00:49:34.490 --> 00:49:36.640
hundreds of yards away.

00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:38.510
And what she has
shown experimentally

00:49:38.510 --> 00:49:42.750
is elephants can communicate
with each other with vibration

00:49:42.750 --> 00:49:43.820
through their feet.

00:49:43.820 --> 00:49:48.170
And she has done some brilliant
classical ethology studies

00:49:48.170 --> 00:49:51.680
of manipulating it and seeing if
you could change the elephant.

00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:54.220
They're talking to each
other with vibration.

00:49:54.220 --> 00:49:58.460
All of this very, very
different than we would guess.

00:49:58.460 --> 00:50:00.300
Tactile stimulation.

00:50:00.300 --> 00:50:03.950
And out of this came one of
the iconic experiments and one

00:50:03.950 --> 00:50:07.510
we will come back to lots
in lecturers to come.

00:50:07.510 --> 00:50:10.350
This one you've also seen
every single intro textbook

00:50:10.350 --> 00:50:13.920
out there, which is the
surrogate mother monkeys.

00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:16.740
You got the monkey who's
raised in social isolation,

00:50:16.740 --> 00:50:20.200
and all he's got are two
surrogate moms to choose from.

00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:23.970
And one has this
chicken wire tube torso

00:50:23.970 --> 00:50:26.800
thing with this little
unconvincing Styrofoam

00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:28.020
head put on top.

00:50:28.020 --> 00:50:32.540
And the other one is wrapped
in this nice, warm, terry cloth

00:50:32.540 --> 00:50:35.510
around its chicken wire
torso, with a head on top.

00:50:35.510 --> 00:50:36.700
What's the difference?

00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:38.810
The first one, the
chicken wire one,

00:50:38.810 --> 00:50:41.820
has a bottle of
milk sticking out.

00:50:41.820 --> 00:50:46.270
That one supplies milk,
supplies calories.

00:50:46.270 --> 00:50:49.410
This one supplies warmth.

00:50:49.410 --> 00:50:53.280
And in the mid-1950s, you
would ask somebody, well,

00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:55.880
why do babies like
their mothers?

00:50:55.880 --> 00:50:59.450
Because their mothers positively
reinforce them with milk,

00:50:59.450 --> 00:51:02.920
says BF Skinner, who clearly
knows endlessly about that.

00:51:02.920 --> 00:51:07.250
What is bonding between
mother and child about?

00:51:07.250 --> 00:51:11.950
It's about the mother meeting
the caloric and temperature

00:51:11.950 --> 00:51:13.630
needs of a child.

00:51:13.630 --> 00:51:16.430
By reinforcing the child
with milk now and then,

00:51:16.430 --> 00:51:18.050
the child becomes attached.

00:51:18.050 --> 00:51:20.900
And this is what
dominated in the field.

00:51:20.900 --> 00:51:21.450
OK.

00:51:21.450 --> 00:51:23.120
Nice, abstract question.

00:51:23.120 --> 00:51:26.920
Interesting realm where it
had an implication-- you take

00:51:26.920 --> 00:51:29.260
an infant, you take
a very young child,

00:51:29.260 --> 00:51:31.230
and you put him in
a pediatric ward

00:51:31.230 --> 00:51:34.020
for a couple of weeks
because of some illness.

00:51:34.020 --> 00:51:36.660
And what's the
philosophy at the time,

00:51:36.660 --> 00:51:39.370
derived from
hard-nosed behaviorism?

00:51:39.370 --> 00:51:43.260
It would say, dog equals
cat equals monkey.

00:51:43.260 --> 00:51:45.940
It would say, one person
with a bottle of milk

00:51:45.940 --> 00:51:48.220
equals another person
equals another.

00:51:48.220 --> 00:51:50.970
Parents, they don't
know the routines here.

00:51:50.970 --> 00:51:52.940
They never wash
their hands enough.

00:51:52.940 --> 00:51:55.610
So what we're going to do,
what was standard practice

00:51:55.610 --> 00:51:57.980
in pediatric wards
at the time, was

00:51:57.980 --> 00:52:01.440
parents were allowed to
visit 30 minutes a week.

00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:04.460
And otherwise, all of
the care was provided

00:52:04.460 --> 00:52:06.050
by people working there.

00:52:06.050 --> 00:52:08.850
And eventually,
the best thing ever

00:52:08.850 --> 00:52:11.880
came along that would make
any behaviorist delighted.

00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:14.740
You could do things with
infants, keeping them going,

00:52:14.740 --> 00:52:17.590
without even being
touched by human beings.

00:52:17.590 --> 00:52:21.490
Someone modified
chicken egg incubators

00:52:21.490 --> 00:52:23.820
and invented human incubators.

00:52:23.820 --> 00:52:26.700
And an entire just
grotesque literature

00:52:26.700 --> 00:52:30.340
shows the more incubators
a hospital had,

00:52:30.340 --> 00:52:33.770
the shorter the life
expectancy was of infants

00:52:33.770 --> 00:52:35.820
who came in in their ward.

00:52:35.820 --> 00:52:38.670
But that was the dominant
notion at the time.

00:52:38.670 --> 00:52:40.600
What do infants like about mom?

00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:42.070
She gets calories.

00:52:42.070 --> 00:52:43.070
She gives them calories.

00:52:43.070 --> 00:52:43.569
So OK.

00:52:43.569 --> 00:52:45.130
So you've got the
baby monkey there.

00:52:45.130 --> 00:52:48.340
And she's got two moms to choose
from-- the one that gives milk,

00:52:48.340 --> 00:52:51.740
and the one that has the terry
cloth with the tactile stuff.

00:52:51.740 --> 00:52:53.860
And which one is she
going to cling to?

00:52:53.860 --> 00:52:56.160
It's clear, if you had
BF Skinner in there,

00:52:56.160 --> 00:52:58.250
he'd be up there nursing
on the milk bottle

00:52:58.250 --> 00:52:59.630
within a couple of seconds.

00:52:59.630 --> 00:53:01.650
But what does the
baby do instead?

00:53:01.650 --> 00:53:03.400
Which one does it bond to?

00:53:03.400 --> 00:53:06.290
The warm, terrycloth mother.

00:53:06.290 --> 00:53:07.200
Ah.

00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:10.680
Love has so much more to
do than just calories,

00:53:10.680 --> 00:53:14.620
and adequate clothing, and a
vaccine every now and then.

00:53:14.620 --> 00:53:17.700
This was a study by a man
named Harry Harlow which

00:53:17.700 --> 00:53:21.320
transformed-- began to get
people to think utterly

00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:23.970
differently about the
nature of bonding.

00:53:23.970 --> 00:53:26.720
We will hear tons about
that work down the line.

00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:28.910
So tactile stuff.

00:53:28.910 --> 00:53:33.280
Finally, what is the realm of
the most brilliant combination

00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:36.790
of various releasing stimuli
triggering fixed action

00:53:36.790 --> 00:53:38.680
patterns out the wazoo?

00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:42.140
What baby animals look
like in every species

00:53:42.140 --> 00:53:44.820
out there short of
crocodiles and snakes.

00:53:44.820 --> 00:53:47.450
All the baby animals and
all the different species

00:53:47.450 --> 00:53:50.320
have the little short
muzzles, and the big round

00:53:50.320 --> 00:53:52.200
eyes, and the big
shiny forehead,

00:53:52.200 --> 00:53:54.500
and the big ears
sticking out there,

00:53:54.500 --> 00:53:56.910
and maybe a
distinctive coloration

00:53:56.910 --> 00:54:00.620
that sets them off different
from mom, from adults.

00:54:00.620 --> 00:54:06.130
And every species, you take some
incredibly cute baby monkey,

00:54:06.130 --> 00:54:10.910
and polar bears are going
to say, oh, look how cute!

00:54:10.910 --> 00:54:13.650
And their eyes are going
to dilate, their pupils,

00:54:13.650 --> 00:54:17.450
and you are going to
elicit cute responses.

00:54:17.450 --> 00:54:19.950
The term, this set of
fixed action patterns

00:54:19.950 --> 00:54:22.350
that people and all
sorts of species

00:54:22.350 --> 00:54:27.380
do in response to the releasing
stimuli of a cute baby.

00:54:27.380 --> 00:54:30.600
And, I kid you not,
the early generations

00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:33.850
of Disney illustrators
studied this.

00:54:33.850 --> 00:54:37.460
They studied what it is
that makes baby faces baby.

00:54:37.460 --> 00:54:41.780
And an amazing paper, classic
one by Stephen Jay Gould,

00:54:41.780 --> 00:54:45.790
talking about Mickey Mouse,
the evolution of Mickey Mouse.

00:54:45.790 --> 00:54:48.310
If you go back to when
Mickey Mouse started off

00:54:48.310 --> 00:54:50.110
in, I don't know,
the 1920s or so,

00:54:50.110 --> 00:54:51.940
his name was Steamboat Willie.

00:54:51.940 --> 00:54:53.830
And he was this rat.

00:54:53.830 --> 00:54:58.240
He was this like skinny,
angular, ectomorph rat

00:54:58.240 --> 00:55:00.080
thing with five fingers.

00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:04.890
And he was basically sort of
this double entendre-ing sort

00:55:04.890 --> 00:55:08.920
of mildly sexual
aggressive beast, who

00:55:08.920 --> 00:55:11.020
was always ripping people off.

00:55:11.020 --> 00:55:15.570
And somehow he turned
from that into our Mickey,

00:55:15.570 --> 00:55:17.140
who delights people.

00:55:17.140 --> 00:55:19.840
And what Gould showed
was-- in this paper,

00:55:19.840 --> 00:55:24.120
he actually showed the evolution
of Mickey Mouse's muzzle

00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:26.910
as over the decades, showing
how it was getting smaller,

00:55:26.910 --> 00:55:28.790
and the ratio of the
forehead to this.

00:55:28.790 --> 00:55:31.887
And somewhere along the way,
Mickey lost one of his fingers.

00:55:31.887 --> 00:55:33.470
And somewhere along
the way, his voice

00:55:33.470 --> 00:55:36.790
got real prepubescent,
which it wasn't early on.

00:55:36.790 --> 00:55:40.960
And suddenly, the oh so chased
mysterious Minnie shows up,

00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:42.740
and all they ever do
is sing and dance.

00:55:42.740 --> 00:55:46.300
And this is an amazing paper
on how the Disney artists

00:55:46.300 --> 00:55:50.040
eventually learned what is
it about baby animals that

00:55:50.040 --> 00:55:52.910
makes everybody want
to be around them.

00:55:52.910 --> 00:55:56.000
So we see here the
releasing stimuli.

00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:59.620
Next thing, after the break,
what's going on in the head

00:55:59.620 --> 00:56:01.890
in between the
releasing stimulus,

00:56:01.890 --> 00:56:04.260
and out comes the
fixed action pattern.

00:56:04.260 --> 00:56:04.760
OK.

00:56:04.760 --> 00:56:06.890
So five minutes.

00:56:06.890 --> 00:56:08.370
Two great questions.

00:56:08.370 --> 00:56:12.030
The first one, going back
to Niko Tinbergen's attempts

00:56:12.030 --> 00:56:15.240
to get baby gulls eaten--
that whole business

00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:16.940
about flipping the
eggshells over.

00:56:16.940 --> 00:56:21.210
Somebody asking, so why
haven't eggs and birds

00:56:21.210 --> 00:56:23.860
and stuff evolved so that
the inside of the egg shell

00:56:23.860 --> 00:56:25.340
is speckled also?

00:56:25.340 --> 00:56:27.280
And the answer is,
I haven't a clue.

00:56:27.280 --> 00:56:28.611
Does anybody know why?

00:56:28.611 --> 00:56:30.860
Is there some good reason
why the inside of egg shells

00:56:30.860 --> 00:56:31.670
have to be white?

00:56:34.630 --> 00:56:41.990
Calcium or-- well, there's
got to be some good reason.

00:56:41.990 --> 00:56:43.650
But you go out and test that.

00:56:43.650 --> 00:56:44.150
OK.

00:56:44.150 --> 00:56:47.400
So that would have been
an interesting study.

00:56:47.400 --> 00:56:48.320
I have no idea why.

00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:50.470
The other one, of
the same sort of bent

00:56:50.470 --> 00:56:53.760
of the, how do they figure this
out-- how do they figure out

00:56:53.760 --> 00:56:58.400
that human males can detect,
like the sound of women's

00:56:58.400 --> 00:57:02.320
voices when they rise around
the time of ovulation?

00:57:02.320 --> 00:57:04.290
What you do is
you record voices,

00:57:04.290 --> 00:57:07.440
and then you manipulate
the pitch that it's at.

00:57:07.440 --> 00:57:09.620
And this is a very
subtle effect,

00:57:09.620 --> 00:57:11.110
but people listen to it.

00:57:11.110 --> 00:57:14.390
And if they're men and they
listen to it, on the average,

00:57:14.390 --> 00:57:17.840
they will rate the voices that
are a little bit higher as more

00:57:17.840 --> 00:57:18.760
appealing.

00:57:18.760 --> 00:57:22.310
We will hear plenty about
stuff like that down the line.

00:57:22.310 --> 00:57:22.910
OK.

00:57:22.910 --> 00:57:24.230
So what do we got so far?

00:57:24.230 --> 00:57:27.450
We have looked at interviewing
an animal in its own language

00:57:27.450 --> 00:57:29.900
and asking what the behavior
is about-- the effect

00:57:29.900 --> 00:57:31.720
of experience on the behavior.

00:57:31.720 --> 00:57:35.570
Looking at what's going on
in terms of adaptive value

00:57:35.570 --> 00:57:38.180
in a totally different way
than the evolutionary folks

00:57:38.180 --> 00:57:39.430
would be looking at.

00:57:39.430 --> 00:57:43.080
Looking at what-- in the outside
world, what releasing stimulus

00:57:43.080 --> 00:57:44.290
triggered the behavior.

00:57:44.290 --> 00:57:49.090
Huge take home message there
being animals, including us,

00:57:49.090 --> 00:57:52.380
are communicating
information in sensory realms

00:57:52.380 --> 00:57:55.170
we could never even
guess at-- interviewing

00:57:55.170 --> 00:57:56.390
in its own language.

00:57:56.390 --> 00:57:58.490
And also, along the
way there, training

00:57:58.490 --> 00:58:01.760
ethologists to come up with
really clever, cool, elegant

00:58:01.760 --> 00:58:02.910
experiments.

00:58:02.910 --> 00:58:04.070
So the next step.

00:58:04.070 --> 00:58:06.360
What's going on
here between when

00:58:06.360 --> 00:58:09.890
the releasing stimulus happens,
and out pops the behavior

00:58:09.890 --> 00:58:11.390
from the other side?

00:58:11.390 --> 00:58:15.640
Old ethology jargon-- what is
the innate releasing mechanism?

00:58:15.640 --> 00:58:18.280
Which is like this really
unfortunate phrase.

00:58:18.280 --> 00:58:19.714
But what's going on inside?

00:58:19.714 --> 00:58:21.130
And it was right
around this point

00:58:21.130 --> 00:58:23.750
that all the classical
ethologists would say,

00:58:23.750 --> 00:58:24.840
we don't know!

00:58:24.840 --> 00:58:27.040
It's obviously
important, but we're not

00:58:27.040 --> 00:58:28.660
able to understand it.

00:58:28.660 --> 00:58:30.440
And that has changed now.

00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:34.590
And what that field is
called is neuroethology.

00:58:34.590 --> 00:58:36.890
And that is the hottest
part of the field

00:58:36.890 --> 00:58:40.280
in the last few decades,
trying to understand what's

00:58:40.280 --> 00:58:44.740
going on in the brain that
turns certain releasing stimuli

00:58:44.740 --> 00:58:47.550
into behaviors
out the other end.

00:58:47.550 --> 00:58:50.490
And there have been
some amazing successes

00:58:50.490 --> 00:58:52.529
in this realm in
terms of working out

00:58:52.529 --> 00:58:53.570
the nuts and bolts of it.

00:58:53.570 --> 00:58:55.720
One example, the
one that's probably

00:58:55.720 --> 00:58:58.590
the most studied,
which is understanding

00:58:58.590 --> 00:59:01.960
the neurobiology of birdsong.

00:59:01.960 --> 00:59:05.950
Bird song-- how does a
bird learn its species

00:59:05.950 --> 00:59:07.060
specific song?

00:59:07.060 --> 00:59:09.510
How does a bird learn
one that winds up

00:59:09.510 --> 00:59:11.660
being distinctive for itself?

00:59:11.660 --> 00:59:14.800
What happens to birds
that have to come up

00:59:14.800 --> 00:59:17.340
with a new song every
year, because they're

00:59:17.340 --> 00:59:20.230
seasonal breeders in a way
where they're migrating around?

00:59:20.230 --> 00:59:21.490
How do they learn that?

00:59:21.490 --> 00:59:25.540
What sort of sensory stimulation
do they need from around them?

00:59:25.540 --> 00:59:28.220
If you raise a bird
in complete isolation,

00:59:28.220 --> 00:59:30.080
does it come up
with a song which is

00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:32.240
exactly what its species does?

00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:34.920
No, but it's kind
of close to it.

00:59:34.920 --> 00:59:37.200
It needs experience to shape it.

00:59:37.200 --> 00:59:40.550
What's going on in bird
species like [INAUDIBLE] birds

00:59:40.550 --> 00:59:43.610
that imitate the
sounds of other birds?

00:59:43.610 --> 00:59:46.220
And people have been
dissecting this down

00:59:46.220 --> 00:59:49.890
to the individual neurons
for years, understanding

00:59:49.890 --> 00:59:52.300
what's going on in between.

00:59:52.300 --> 00:59:55.470
Another domain that seems
far more inexplicable for why

00:59:55.470 --> 00:59:57.470
people would want to
spend decades on it

00:59:57.470 --> 00:59:59.200
is-- for people
who took Bio core,

00:59:59.200 --> 01:00:01.240
I always go over
this one-- a reflex.

01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:04.780
A reflex you find
in female hamsters.

01:00:04.780 --> 01:00:07.170
Which is you get
a female hamster,

01:00:07.170 --> 01:00:11.940
and you put pressure, tactile
pressure, on her rear end.

01:00:11.940 --> 01:00:14.550
And what she will
do is arch her back

01:00:14.550 --> 01:00:18.770
at that point and produce what
is called a lordosis reflex.

01:00:18.770 --> 01:00:20.150
So what's that about?

01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:22.530
It's obviously a
fixed action pattern.

01:00:22.530 --> 01:00:24.370
Let's ask an adaptive question.

01:00:24.370 --> 01:00:27.350
What's the advantage of
having a lordosis reflex?

01:00:27.350 --> 01:00:30.190
What it does is, by
arching up that way,

01:00:30.190 --> 01:00:32.670
it exposes the
female's genitals,

01:00:32.670 --> 01:00:36.310
making it easier for
a male to mount her.

01:00:36.310 --> 01:00:39.020
Well, when is that
useful for the female?

01:00:39.020 --> 01:00:40.800
If she's ovulating.

01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:45.460
You only get this reflex when
estrogen levels are elevated.

01:00:45.460 --> 01:00:48.550
And adaptive value of
that built around the fact

01:00:48.550 --> 01:00:50.530
that most things
that are pressing

01:00:50.530 --> 01:00:52.650
on the rear end
of female hamsters

01:00:52.650 --> 01:00:55.740
are not grad students trying
to get their degree eventually.

01:00:55.740 --> 01:00:59.010
[INAUDIBLE] ethologically
relevant context,

01:00:59.010 --> 01:01:01.440
that's part of the mating
courtship display stuff.

01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:06.200
And there is a guy I know who is
the king-- the king of pressing

01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:08.280
on the rear end of
female hamsters.

01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:10.560
People will not be able
to talk about the behavior

01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:13.410
for centuries to come
without his name being

01:01:13.410 --> 01:01:14.660
sung about there.

01:01:14.660 --> 01:01:16.860
And he and his
lab have gotten it

01:01:16.860 --> 01:01:21.180
down to individual neurons
in the whole reflex pathway,

01:01:21.180 --> 01:01:23.790
and which neurons are
affected by estrogen,

01:01:23.790 --> 01:01:27.830
and how exactly it
works-- neuroethology.

01:01:27.830 --> 01:01:30.530
Another realm of it,
of neuroethology,

01:01:30.530 --> 01:01:32.590
is one done with
humans these days--

01:01:32.590 --> 01:01:36.290
taking advantage of brain
scanning techniques, and seeing

01:01:36.290 --> 01:01:40.630
what sort of subliminal sensory
information you give someone,

01:01:40.630 --> 01:01:42.800
and what parts of
the brain change

01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:44.400
their levels of activity.

01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:47.110
And the scared sweat versus
the neutral sweat study

01:01:47.110 --> 01:01:50.250
is a perfect example
of that, and we

01:01:50.250 --> 01:01:53.050
will hear plenty of those
in the lectures to come.

01:01:53.050 --> 01:01:55.560
As neuroethology
really took off,

01:01:55.560 --> 01:01:58.160
an additional
elaboration happened,

01:01:58.160 --> 01:02:02.390
which is people began to
try doing neuroethology out

01:02:02.390 --> 01:02:05.350
in the field with animals
in their real habitat.

01:02:05.350 --> 01:02:07.170
Because all the ones
I just described

01:02:07.170 --> 01:02:08.870
were the laboratory
animals trying

01:02:08.870 --> 01:02:10.700
to do it out in the
field, and there's

01:02:10.700 --> 01:02:12.670
been a number of approaches.

01:02:12.670 --> 01:02:15.840
One is, people-- a guy
named John Wingfield used

01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:17.610
to be at the University
of Washington.

01:02:17.610 --> 01:02:21.060
John Wingfield studies birds.

01:02:21.060 --> 01:02:23.660
And I have no idea if he ever
actually wanted to study birds

01:02:23.660 --> 01:02:25.930
or if he was fated to
do this from the start.

01:02:25.930 --> 01:02:30.280
But what he does is, he studies
the physiology and the behavior

01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:32.980
of bird species that
migrate from Baja

01:02:32.980 --> 01:02:36.670
up to the Arctic each
year and back again.

01:02:36.670 --> 01:02:41.140
Bird species where what happens
with their migratory behavior,

01:02:41.140 --> 01:02:44.090
if there's an extra
freeze that's unexpected,

01:02:44.090 --> 01:02:47.340
if spring comes earlier,
what are the-- and he

01:02:47.340 --> 01:02:48.490
traps these birds.

01:02:48.490 --> 01:02:51.670
He nets them, and he's got
like electrodes in their heads,

01:02:51.670 --> 01:02:55.280
and lets them go to fly off to
Alaska, recording from there.

01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:58.700
And this is neuroethology
stuff-- figuring out

01:02:58.700 --> 01:03:02.380
the circuitry going on
precisely with that, with birds

01:03:02.380 --> 01:03:04.592
in their natural setting.

01:03:04.592 --> 01:03:06.550
Another example, which
is some of the work I've

01:03:06.550 --> 01:03:09.240
done over the years, which
is studying baboons out

01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:12.860
in their natural habitat
and trying to do ethology,

01:03:12.860 --> 01:03:15.250
neuroethology stuff, out there.

01:03:15.250 --> 01:03:17.650
What, for example,
does your personality--

01:03:17.650 --> 01:03:20.170
if you were a baboon--
have to do with the brain

01:03:20.170 --> 01:03:22.360
chemistry of anxiety in you?

01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:24.750
You remember the stuff
by now, benzodiazepines

01:03:24.750 --> 01:03:27.170
and the benzodiazepine
receptors.

01:03:27.170 --> 01:03:30.150
Are there personality
related differences

01:03:30.150 --> 01:03:32.950
in the brain chemistry of
benzodiazepines in baboons

01:03:32.950 --> 01:03:33.450
out there.

01:03:33.450 --> 01:03:35.450
And you can squeeze
out a surprising amount

01:03:35.450 --> 01:03:36.470
of information.

01:03:36.470 --> 01:03:39.410
All of this is part
of the transition

01:03:39.410 --> 01:03:41.200
back when of saying,
well, something

01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:43.650
has to be going on
in between there.

01:03:43.650 --> 01:03:46.440
You're a behaviorist,
and you say, who cares?

01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:48.275
You're an ethologist,
and you would say,

01:03:48.275 --> 01:03:49.900
wouldn't it be great
that someday we're

01:03:49.900 --> 01:03:51.290
going to be able to study it?

01:03:51.290 --> 01:03:53.760
And what the neuroethologist
actually can do

01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:56.490
is study it and
begin to work out

01:03:56.490 --> 01:04:01.030
circuitry maps and all of
that, what's going on inside.

01:04:01.030 --> 01:04:04.760
Interviewing the brain of an
animal in its own language.

01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:07.320
Because-- as you will see
in some of the anatomy,

01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:09.880
neuroanatomy lectures
to come-- you're not

01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:12.960
going to make any sense about
which parts of the brain

01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:15.350
are big, and send
projections to which

01:04:15.350 --> 01:04:17.540
other parts, until
you know something

01:04:17.540 --> 01:04:19.520
about the behavior
of that species

01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:23.220
and what sort of sensory
systems it pays attention to.

01:04:23.220 --> 01:04:23.720
OK.

01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:25.280
So these are sort
of the big pieces

01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:26.670
of the ethological approach.

01:04:26.670 --> 01:04:27.900
What's the behavior?

01:04:27.900 --> 01:04:28.930
What triggered it?

01:04:28.930 --> 01:04:32.720
What are the intervening
neuro endo steps in there?

01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:34.290
What's the adaptive value?

01:04:34.290 --> 01:04:38.300
What was also the final piece
of the ethological approach was,

01:04:38.300 --> 01:04:40.470
what does learning have
to do with all of this?

01:04:40.470 --> 01:04:43.260
We already know that
learning is relevant in terms

01:04:43.260 --> 01:04:44.980
of those fixed action patterns.

01:04:44.980 --> 01:04:48.930
But exploring learning in
all sorts of additional ways.

01:04:48.930 --> 01:04:52.410
And the ethological
contribution to that field

01:04:52.410 --> 01:04:54.140
is basically twofold.

01:04:54.140 --> 01:04:57.700
The first would be
boring, classical,

01:04:57.700 --> 01:04:59.900
sort of behaviorist
type learning

01:04:59.900 --> 01:05:03.420
paradigms that behaviorists
had explained centuries before.

01:05:03.420 --> 01:05:07.860
What was interesting, showing it
in domains of animal behavior,

01:05:07.860 --> 01:05:09.670
where everybody else
would have said,

01:05:09.670 --> 01:05:11.800
they have to learn
how to do that?

01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:13.300
That's not an instinct?

01:05:13.300 --> 01:05:16.260
Showing realms of
traditional learning

01:05:16.260 --> 01:05:18.140
that were very unexpected.

01:05:18.140 --> 01:05:20.600
The second piece
was showing types

01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:24.340
of learning that break every
rule about how learning

01:05:24.340 --> 01:05:26.300
works if you're a behaviorist.

01:05:26.300 --> 01:05:26.980
OK.

01:05:26.980 --> 01:05:30.610
So what would be a standard
example of normal learning?

01:05:30.610 --> 01:05:33.250
You get reinforced, you're
more likely to do something.

01:05:33.250 --> 01:05:34.830
You get punished,
you're less likely.

01:05:34.830 --> 01:05:36.380
The whole song and dance there.

01:05:36.380 --> 01:05:39.490
Where does just plain old
normal learning-- learning

01:05:39.490 --> 01:05:42.150
from trial and error--
come in in places

01:05:42.150 --> 01:05:43.790
that one would not expect?

01:05:43.790 --> 01:05:48.310
If you are a female monkey,
it is not instinctual

01:05:48.310 --> 01:05:51.850
for you to know what you're
doing with your first baby.

01:05:51.850 --> 01:05:55.195
Maternal competence is
not a strong instinct.

01:05:55.195 --> 01:05:58.220
It does not produce a
bunch of fixed action

01:05:58.220 --> 01:06:01.540
patterns in, for example,
female rhesus monkeys.

01:06:01.540 --> 01:06:03.770
They have to learn how to do it.

01:06:03.770 --> 01:06:05.840
They have to learn how
to hold on to the kid

01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:07.700
when they're jumping
up in a tree.

01:06:07.700 --> 01:06:10.910
They have to learn which end you
try to stick on to the nipple.

01:06:10.910 --> 01:06:13.090
You have to learn all
sorts of stuff like that.

01:06:13.090 --> 01:06:13.880
Weird.

01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:16.540
All of my kids starved to
death, but then today I

01:06:16.540 --> 01:06:18.770
tried switching this
one around this way.

01:06:18.770 --> 01:06:20.180
Isn't that cool?

01:06:20.180 --> 01:06:22.660
Anybody know Niko
Tinbergen's email address?

01:06:22.660 --> 01:06:24.530
What you wind up
seeing there is they

01:06:24.530 --> 01:06:26.840
have to learn how to do it.

01:06:26.840 --> 01:06:29.560
So what sort of
evidence would you see?

01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:34.580
For example, you have mothers
having a higher likelihood

01:06:34.580 --> 01:06:38.060
of their kids surviving as you
go from their first offspring

01:06:38.060 --> 01:06:39.500
to later ones.

01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:40.490
OK.

01:06:40.490 --> 01:06:42.620
But maybe you can
come up with all sorts

01:06:42.620 --> 01:06:44.530
of other things going on there.

01:06:44.530 --> 01:06:47.210
What else do researchers find?

01:06:47.210 --> 01:06:51.960
If you have a big sister,
and you are a female rhesus

01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:54.400
monkey-- or a female baboon,
it's been shown as well.

01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:58.030
If you have a big sister
who has a baby, when

01:06:58.030 --> 01:07:00.230
you have your first
baby, your child

01:07:00.230 --> 01:07:02.270
is more likely to survive.

01:07:02.270 --> 01:07:03.500
How come?

01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:05.870
Because you watched her.

01:07:05.870 --> 01:07:08.180
You watched your
big sister doing it.

01:07:08.180 --> 01:07:12.770
Or if your mother had another
sister, another daughter,

01:07:12.770 --> 01:07:16.140
and you got to-- no, another
child of either sex--

01:07:16.140 --> 01:07:18.470
and you got to watch,
what was even more

01:07:18.470 --> 01:07:21.960
clear in the literature was
the more experience you had

01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:25.700
actually holding on to
your niece or nephew there,

01:07:25.700 --> 01:07:27.650
the more-- as
termed in the field

01:07:27.650 --> 01:07:31.360
now-- the more [INAUDIBLE]
behavior that you had,

01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:34.370
the more likely your first
child was to survive.

01:07:34.370 --> 01:07:37.980
Because you were learning
how to be a competent mother

01:07:37.980 --> 01:07:39.750
as a primate, as a monkey.

01:07:39.750 --> 01:07:41.640
It's not, oh, instinctual.

01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:42.930
They just know how to do it.

01:07:42.930 --> 01:07:44.650
It's all hardwired somehow.

01:07:44.650 --> 01:07:47.410
This is a realm where
you have to learn.

01:07:47.410 --> 01:07:49.185
Another domain
where this happens,

01:07:49.185 --> 01:07:51.920
and another one where what
you would immediately say is,

01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:55.430
wait, they didn't do this just
by reflex or instinctually?

01:07:55.430 --> 01:08:00.300
Meerkats-- meerkats who eat
all sorts of unlikely things.

01:08:00.300 --> 01:08:02.730
And one of the things
they eat are scorpions.

01:08:02.730 --> 01:08:07.270
And mom meerkats have to
teach the kids how to hunt

01:08:07.270 --> 01:08:10.030
and eat scorpions without
getting yourself in trouble

01:08:10.030 --> 01:08:10.530
there.

01:08:10.530 --> 01:08:13.650
What is shown-- like
teaching techniques,

01:08:13.650 --> 01:08:17.060
they would be teaching three
blocks away in the Ed school,

01:08:17.060 --> 01:08:20.790
in terms of progressively
making the task harder

01:08:20.790 --> 01:08:22.279
in small increments.

01:08:22.279 --> 01:08:23.359
What happens?

01:08:23.359 --> 01:08:26.420
The meerkat mom goes
and kills a scorpion.

01:08:26.420 --> 01:08:28.200
And for the first
couple of days,

01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:32.680
the baby learns how to eat a
scorpion that's already dead.

01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:35.300
Then, once the kid has
that under control,

01:08:35.300 --> 01:08:37.850
the mom goes and
captures a scorpion.

01:08:37.850 --> 01:08:42.689
Which remains alive, but mom is
able to bite off the stinger,

01:08:42.689 --> 01:08:46.490
and now leaves the kid
with this live scorpion

01:08:46.490 --> 01:08:49.810
that it can learn how to
hunt, and learn how to kill,

01:08:49.810 --> 01:08:50.939
and get food.

01:08:50.939 --> 01:08:52.680
And only when
they're doing that,

01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:56.410
then mom captures a live
scorpion with the stinger

01:08:56.410 --> 01:08:58.970
still on and plops
it down for the kid.

01:08:58.970 --> 01:09:00.988
This is exactly what
they teach you to do

01:09:00.988 --> 01:09:02.279
if you're being a good teacher.

01:09:02.279 --> 01:09:04.910
Which is a nice, small,
incremental steps.

01:09:04.910 --> 01:09:07.170
You don't want to do the
same thing for too long.

01:09:07.170 --> 01:09:08.273
The kid gets bored.

01:09:08.273 --> 01:09:09.939
You don't want to
have too big of steps.

01:09:09.939 --> 01:09:11.210
They get learned helpless.

01:09:11.210 --> 01:09:13.970
And you just-- they're teaching
their kids how to hunt,

01:09:13.970 --> 01:09:16.460
because the kids don't
know how to do it.

01:09:16.460 --> 01:09:19.279
Perfectly clear example
of classical learning,

01:09:19.279 --> 01:09:23.520
but in a domain where nobody
thought it would be going on.

01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:25.689
Another example of
it-- and this is

01:09:25.689 --> 01:09:29.979
one where the behavior itself
was so unlikely that nobody

01:09:29.979 --> 01:09:33.109
would ever have been saying, oh,
animals just know instinctually

01:09:33.109 --> 01:09:34.830
how to do this,
because nobody believed

01:09:34.830 --> 01:09:39.670
this behavior could occur--
which is animals making tools.

01:09:39.670 --> 01:09:42.330
This has been shown in a
number of species, including,

01:09:42.330 --> 01:09:43.859
for example, cetaceans.

01:09:43.859 --> 01:09:46.960
Where it's been best
studied is in apes.

01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:47.990
Other ape species.

01:09:47.990 --> 01:09:49.439
Actually, we make tools, too.

01:09:49.439 --> 01:09:51.130
So all of the ape species.

01:09:51.130 --> 01:09:54.660
And Jane Goodall, pioneer
of chimp research,

01:09:54.660 --> 01:09:57.390
was the first one to
discover this-- chimps being

01:09:57.390 --> 01:10:00.490
able to strip the little bark
and stuff off of a long twig

01:10:00.490 --> 01:10:02.660
and insert it into
a termite mound

01:10:02.660 --> 01:10:04.245
and pull it up with
all the termites

01:10:04.245 --> 01:10:06.640
that grabbed onto the stick
when it was down there.

01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:08.640
And now being able
to eat the termites.

01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:13.150
And chimps, various types of
populations of chimps, they

01:10:13.150 --> 01:10:16.500
use tools to hammer,
to break open nuts.

01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:18.750
They know how to use
a hammer and anvil.

01:10:18.750 --> 01:10:21.655
They get a flat rock, and
they do this with this.

01:10:21.655 --> 01:10:24.640
All sorts of tool
making and tool using.

01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:27.460
As we will hear, there is
at least one population

01:10:27.460 --> 01:10:30.790
of chimps that has been studied
where males will actually

01:10:30.790 --> 01:10:35.850
fashion large pieces of wood--
Where they will work to modify

01:10:35.850 --> 01:10:37.680
it, to use it as a weapon.

01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:40.650
They can build tools
that are weapons.

01:10:40.650 --> 01:10:42.060
So what's going on with that?

01:10:42.060 --> 01:10:46.150
And all sorts of studies
showing, for example, the more

01:10:46.150 --> 01:10:49.060
experience you have sitting
and watching somebody else

01:10:49.060 --> 01:10:52.890
make these things, the faster
you're going to master it.

01:10:52.890 --> 01:10:55.870
But you actually want
hands on practice.

01:10:55.870 --> 01:10:58.440
The more the individual,
the other chimp,

01:10:58.440 --> 01:11:00.180
gives you the
building blocks of it

01:11:00.180 --> 01:11:02.580
to start doing the
piece and all of that,

01:11:02.580 --> 01:11:07.320
and you begin to master
it learning by experience.

01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:09.610
One thing that is
very amusing is

01:11:09.610 --> 01:11:13.220
that it has been shown
that chimps, the daughters

01:11:13.220 --> 01:11:15.630
learn much, much
faster than the sons.

01:11:15.630 --> 01:11:17.850
Because the sons don't
pay attention to mom

01:11:17.850 --> 01:11:19.940
when she's sitting there
and trying to get them

01:11:19.940 --> 01:11:21.140
with their hands to do this.

01:11:21.140 --> 01:11:23.130
The daughters are
much more attentive.

01:11:23.130 --> 01:11:27.560
What you also see is, the larger
the social group, the earlier

01:11:27.560 --> 01:11:30.250
in life the kids
learn the tool use.

01:11:30.250 --> 01:11:33.960
And this is brilliant
ape behavior,

01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:35.710
brilliant ape learning.

01:11:35.710 --> 01:11:37.320
Monkeys don't do this.

01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:40.810
I have seen baboons--
films of them, actually.

01:11:40.810 --> 01:11:43.590
I have seen baboons on films
where they are watching

01:11:43.590 --> 01:11:45.550
these chimps doing the
thing with the stick

01:11:45.550 --> 01:11:47.610
there, and going down,
and out come the termites.

01:11:47.610 --> 01:11:48.850
And do it again and again.

01:11:48.850 --> 01:11:52.160
And finally, the chimp is just
gorged with all the termites

01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:53.890
and staggers off for a nap.

01:11:53.890 --> 01:11:57.580
And the baboon comes over
and will pick up the stick

01:11:57.580 --> 01:12:00.790
and shake it at
the termite mound

01:12:00.790 --> 01:12:02.650
or push it against
the side of it.

01:12:02.650 --> 01:12:04.750
Monkeys can't do this.

01:12:04.750 --> 01:12:07.510
Apes can, but they don't
do it instinctually.

01:12:07.510 --> 01:12:09.740
They gotta learn how to do this.

01:12:09.740 --> 01:12:15.180
So another domain of learning--
learning purely of the,

01:12:15.180 --> 01:12:17.340
we know how this
works, we just didn't

01:12:17.340 --> 01:12:19.970
think it would be
going on in this realm.

01:12:19.970 --> 01:12:22.220
But then, what
ethology has been most

01:12:22.220 --> 01:12:26.320
amazing at is showing types
of learning that are simply

01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:31.150
unexpected, that break all the
classic rules of reinforcement

01:12:31.150 --> 01:12:32.020
theory.

01:12:32.020 --> 01:12:33.490
One example.

01:12:33.490 --> 01:12:38.140
One example of it is what is
now called one trial learning.

01:12:38.140 --> 01:12:40.170
Which is another
term that I think

01:12:40.170 --> 01:12:41.670
I used the other
day, the one that's

01:12:41.670 --> 01:12:44.510
sort of more-- sort of a classic
that everybody learned back

01:12:44.510 --> 01:12:50.160
when, that animals will
imprint on something after one

01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:52.560
round of exposure to it.

01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:56.610
And the classic example
would be Konrad Lorenz

01:12:56.610 --> 01:12:58.360
and his famous little duckies.

01:12:58.360 --> 01:13:01.770
That when birds come out, there
is a short period after which

01:13:01.770 --> 01:13:06.450
where they imprint on any
big thing moving around,

01:13:06.450 --> 01:13:08.640
on a fairly safe assumption
that, in most cases,

01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:10.710
that big thing is
going to be mom.

01:13:10.710 --> 01:13:13.320
That's how they bond to mom.

01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:15.580
There is a short
window, what is now

01:13:15.580 --> 01:13:18.960
known as a critical period,
where the bonding goes on

01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:20.010
during that time.

01:13:20.010 --> 01:13:23.270
And whatever big thing is
moving around-- and eventually,

01:13:23.270 --> 01:13:26.170
people were doing
classic ethology studies

01:13:26.170 --> 01:13:29.280
with subtraction and
substitution of stimuli

01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:32.030
and running around with
like a stuffed Big Bird.

01:13:32.030 --> 01:13:34.350
And they imprint on
that, and all sorts

01:13:34.350 --> 01:13:37.900
of large mobile objects--
basically anything that moves.

01:13:37.900 --> 01:13:41.710
And that's where you would get
all the little duckies, goose

01:13:41.710 --> 01:13:45.270
stepping behind Konrad Lorenz
when they had imprinted on him.

01:13:45.270 --> 01:13:48.530
And this is not by
trial and error.

01:13:48.530 --> 01:13:51.270
Oh, I initially got
bonded to this thing

01:13:51.270 --> 01:13:53.160
with sharp teeth and claws.

01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:55.230
And that was kind of a bummer.

01:13:55.230 --> 01:13:57.230
That involved all
sorts of blood loss.

01:13:57.230 --> 01:13:59.750
So I've learned, don't
bond to that sort of thing.

01:13:59.750 --> 01:14:04.220
Well, then I tried bonding to,
are you my mother bulldozers?

01:14:04.220 --> 01:14:06.400
And then I tried
bonding to this.

01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:09.179
And, oh, eventually you
figure out your mother

01:14:09.179 --> 01:14:10.720
is the one you should
be hanging out.

01:14:10.720 --> 01:14:11.340
No.

01:14:11.340 --> 01:14:15.000
This is not a domain where you
can learn by trial and error.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.440
And what is seen instead
is this phenomenon

01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:19.080
of one trial learning.

01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:21.680
The first thing baby
birds are exposed

01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:24.700
to in many species, the first
big thing moving around,

01:14:24.700 --> 01:14:29.170
statistically likely to be mom,
that's who you get attached to.

01:14:29.170 --> 01:14:32.696
And lots of interesting
neuroethology

01:14:32.696 --> 01:14:34.070
has gone on over
the years trying

01:14:34.070 --> 01:14:36.630
to figure out what are the
mechanisms of imprinting.

01:14:36.630 --> 01:14:38.070
One of the things
that come out is

01:14:38.070 --> 01:14:42.310
it's nowhere near as dramatic
of critical periods--

01:14:42.310 --> 01:14:44.900
if you don't figure out who
mom is in the next 7 and 1/2

01:14:44.900 --> 01:14:46.590
minutes, you are up the creek.

01:14:46.590 --> 01:14:50.620
You will never-- it's more
a sort of relative term.

01:14:50.620 --> 01:14:53.380
But nonetheless, that's
not how learning works.

01:14:53.380 --> 01:14:55.970
You're supposed to learn
from trial and error that

01:14:55.970 --> 01:14:58.730
snakes, and leopards,
and all of those guys

01:14:58.730 --> 01:15:01.290
are not good mothering models.

01:15:01.290 --> 01:15:02.780
But it happens.

01:15:02.780 --> 01:15:04.410
Another realm.

01:15:04.410 --> 01:15:08.710
Something that came to be
known as prepared learning.

01:15:08.710 --> 01:15:11.460
Which is, there's
all sorts of ways

01:15:11.460 --> 01:15:14.860
in which some piece of
information can be learned.

01:15:14.860 --> 01:15:18.080
Or there's all sorts
of sensory associations

01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:20.660
you could make with
something, but you

01:15:20.660 --> 01:15:24.470
are prepared to make certain
of those associations

01:15:24.470 --> 01:15:26.430
more easily than others.

01:15:26.430 --> 01:15:27.945
What do I mean by this?

01:15:27.945 --> 01:15:30.220
A classic example
of it is what's

01:15:30.220 --> 01:15:32.690
called the sauce
Bearnaise syndrome.

01:15:32.690 --> 01:15:36.340
And sauce Bearnaise is
some fancy French food

01:15:36.340 --> 01:15:37.772
that seems very unappealing.

01:15:37.772 --> 01:15:39.230
And I don't know
what it's made of.

01:15:39.230 --> 01:15:43.385
But this was first described
by a guy, University

01:15:43.385 --> 01:15:45.720
of Pennsylvania,
Martin Seligman, one

01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:48.560
of the most sort
of major figures

01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:51.260
in psychology in the
last decades or so.

01:15:51.260 --> 01:15:53.390
We will hear plenty
about him to come.

01:15:53.390 --> 01:15:58.180
And this was, one evening
he went out for dinner,

01:15:58.180 --> 01:16:00.560
where he had sauce Bearnaise.

01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:05.530
And then he went to a concert
of some opera or something,

01:16:05.530 --> 01:16:07.210
and then he went home.

01:16:07.210 --> 01:16:11.190
And for some reason or other, he
got himself a terrible stomach

01:16:11.190 --> 01:16:12.610
ache.

01:16:12.610 --> 01:16:13.600
Terrible stomach ache.

01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:14.650
It was a total drag.

01:16:14.650 --> 01:16:16.130
All night long, he had it.

01:16:16.130 --> 01:16:17.230
He didn't throw up.

01:16:17.230 --> 01:16:18.100
It wasn't that bad.

01:16:18.100 --> 01:16:20.870
But he had a terrible stomach
ache, recovered from it.

01:16:20.870 --> 01:16:23.810
Weeks, months later,
he goes out for dinner.

01:16:23.810 --> 01:16:25.730
And he goes off to
this French restaurant,

01:16:25.730 --> 01:16:28.020
and has sauce Bearnaise,
and is about to take

01:16:28.020 --> 01:16:31.510
the first spoonful, or forkful,
or handful, or whatever.

01:16:31.510 --> 01:16:35.880
And he realizes this smells
totally repulsive to him.

01:16:35.880 --> 01:16:38.080
He could not eat
the sauce Bearnaise.

01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:40.520
He has never been
able to since then,

01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:44.850
because he's associating it with
the stomach pains afterward.

01:16:44.850 --> 01:16:46.180
Remember, he didn't throw up.

01:16:46.180 --> 01:16:49.600
He wasn't burping up sauce
Bearnaise vapors or anything.

01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:51.390
So it's not like, oh,
the taste was just

01:16:51.390 --> 01:16:54.560
like the acidic stuff that came
roaring up the other direction,

01:16:54.560 --> 01:16:56.590
just associating with
the stomach pain.

01:16:56.590 --> 01:16:57.090
OK.

01:16:57.090 --> 01:16:57.816
That's sensible.

01:16:57.816 --> 01:16:59.690
I mean, that's not great,
but you can kind of

01:16:59.690 --> 01:17:00.770
see how that happens.

01:17:00.770 --> 01:17:02.790
But you think about
it, and that's

01:17:02.790 --> 01:17:06.370
breaking all sorts of
classical rules of behaviorism

01:17:06.370 --> 01:17:07.610
and classical learning.

01:17:07.610 --> 01:17:11.400
Which is, if you were going to
make an association-- you can

01:17:11.400 --> 01:17:15.645
have a choice between an
association of a with b or a

01:17:15.645 --> 01:17:18.670
with c-- you're going to
make the association more

01:17:18.670 --> 01:17:23.670
readily with whichever one
comes closer in time to a.

01:17:23.670 --> 01:17:26.140
So what came closer
in time for him?

01:17:26.140 --> 01:17:27.270
The opera.

01:17:27.270 --> 01:17:29.650
He finished dinner, and
then he went to the opera

01:17:29.650 --> 01:17:32.580
and spent hours listening
to Wagner or something,

01:17:32.580 --> 01:17:35.750
and he didn't attribute
his stomach ache to that.

01:17:35.750 --> 01:17:37.960
The next time he went to
an opera, he was perfect.

01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:39.730
He was just fine with that.

01:17:39.730 --> 01:17:41.700
He had prepared learning.

01:17:41.700 --> 01:17:44.500
For pain coming
from your gut, you

01:17:44.500 --> 01:17:48.890
are far more likely to associate
with food than with music.

01:17:48.890 --> 01:17:53.090
Prepared learning in us
for pain in our GI tract

01:17:53.090 --> 01:17:55.800
with gustatory stimuli.

01:17:55.800 --> 01:17:58.040
More examples are
prepared learning.

01:17:58.040 --> 01:17:59.730
So now you take
these, and you're

01:17:59.730 --> 01:18:02.020
trying to teach them where
there's a food source.

01:18:02.020 --> 01:18:03.110
Experimental stuff.

01:18:03.110 --> 01:18:06.270
And you give them
some like mark or sign

01:18:06.270 --> 01:18:08.512
or whatever to tell them,
here it is, and remember

01:18:08.512 --> 01:18:09.470
this for the next time.

01:18:09.470 --> 01:18:12.510
Do they make an association
between the food source

01:18:12.510 --> 01:18:14.300
and whatever marker you put up?

01:18:14.300 --> 01:18:16.270
And what they show
in the studies is,

01:18:16.270 --> 01:18:18.080
they can modify the marker.

01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:20.460
They either modify the
shape of it-- here's

01:18:20.460 --> 01:18:24.240
a little triangle, square, or
whatever-- the color of it,

01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:27.190
or they can modify the smell.

01:18:27.190 --> 01:18:29.960
The smell that they-- some
smell source that they--

01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:33.430
And what they show is, bees
have prepared learning.

01:18:33.430 --> 01:18:37.130
They learn the smell
associations much, much faster

01:18:37.130 --> 01:18:39.360
than the shape or the
color associations.

01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:40.870
They can learn of
the other ones,

01:18:40.870 --> 01:18:45.010
but bees have prepared learning
for making associations

01:18:45.010 --> 01:18:48.160
by olfactory cues more
readily than making them

01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:51.000
by color or shape.

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:52.310
More examples.

01:18:52.310 --> 01:18:56.430
One of the great
urban legends is

01:18:56.430 --> 01:19:00.960
that humans are innately
scared of spiders and snakes.

01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:03.500
Humans are not, because
there's all sorts of cultures

01:19:03.500 --> 01:19:05.660
where people love spiders
and where, in fact, they

01:19:05.660 --> 01:19:06.267
love spiders.

01:19:06.267 --> 01:19:07.850
Because they love
to chase after them,

01:19:07.850 --> 01:19:10.450
and pull their legs out, and
then cook them up and eat them,

01:19:10.450 --> 01:19:13.350
and people are not scared
in front of spiders

01:19:13.350 --> 01:19:16.090
and getting the
willies from them.

01:19:16.090 --> 01:19:17.180
It is not innate.

01:19:17.180 --> 01:19:20.500
But humans show prepared
learning for being

01:19:20.500 --> 01:19:23.370
scared of spiders and snakes.

01:19:23.370 --> 01:19:27.820
Which is, you can show in
humans and in monkeys, as well,

01:19:27.820 --> 01:19:32.370
the conditioning that's needed
to associate, for example,

01:19:32.370 --> 01:19:35.850
a picture of a spider with
the autonomic response

01:19:35.850 --> 01:19:41.040
to a mild shock, versus
a picture of Disneyland

01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:43.410
and Mickey and associate it.

01:19:43.410 --> 01:19:46.510
That it takes less of
an association for we

01:19:46.510 --> 01:19:50.260
primates to associate something
like a spider or a snake

01:19:50.260 --> 01:19:53.740
picture with something
unpleasant than all sorts

01:19:53.740 --> 01:19:56.330
of other animate stimuli.

01:19:56.330 --> 01:19:58.500
More examples of how this works.

01:19:58.500 --> 01:20:00.530
You give people--
or, as it turns out,

01:20:00.530 --> 01:20:02.000
you give monkeys-- a task.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:05.270
You flash up a complex
picture, and you take it away

01:20:05.270 --> 01:20:06.840
for a few seconds or whatever.

01:20:06.840 --> 01:20:09.220
And then you flash it
up again, and one thing

01:20:09.220 --> 01:20:11.350
has changed in the picture.

01:20:11.350 --> 01:20:13.840
It's a street scene,
wherever it is.

01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:15.659
And you need to pick
out which it is.

01:20:15.659 --> 01:20:17.200
And with the monkey
studies, you need

01:20:17.200 --> 01:20:20.320
to indicate sort of where
it was to get the reward.

01:20:20.320 --> 01:20:23.560
Are you able to pick up the
subtle thing that changed?

01:20:23.560 --> 01:20:27.160
Humans and monkeys
are better picking up

01:20:27.160 --> 01:20:29.520
for animate objects
that change, are

01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:34.030
better at spotting if there
are things like snakes,

01:20:34.030 --> 01:20:37.470
than if they are animals that
we don't associate like that.

01:20:37.470 --> 01:20:40.700
We are better, in this
very rapid exposure, almost

01:20:40.700 --> 01:20:43.840
subliminal stimuli, we have
prepared learning for that.

01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:45.940
Do the exact sort of
thing with humans,

01:20:45.940 --> 01:20:48.690
where what changes from
one flash to the other

01:20:48.690 --> 01:20:52.700
is either an animate object
or an inanimate object.

01:20:52.700 --> 01:20:55.270
Humans have prepared
learning to pick up

01:20:55.270 --> 01:20:59.010
stimuli of animate objects
much, much more readily.

01:20:59.010 --> 01:21:03.170
A shorter exposure time, more of
a subliminal cue, all of that.

01:21:03.170 --> 01:21:07.440
So prepared learning is being
all of these examples where,

01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:11.040
by any logic, universal rules.

01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:13.980
You learn to associate this
with this, as BF Skinner,

01:21:13.980 --> 01:21:16.530
or just as easily with this,
or just as easily with this.

01:21:16.530 --> 01:21:18.950
And dog, and cat, and
they're interchangeable,

01:21:18.950 --> 01:21:20.140
and sensory stimuli.

01:21:20.140 --> 01:21:23.550
But no, all sorts of
species come already

01:21:23.550 --> 01:21:26.780
wired up to learn certain
associations more readily

01:21:26.780 --> 01:21:27.640
than others.

01:21:27.640 --> 01:21:31.520
So completely
violating behaviorism.

01:21:31.520 --> 01:21:32.790
OK.

01:21:32.790 --> 01:21:36.370
Final domain where ethologists
think about interesting stuff

01:21:36.370 --> 01:21:39.620
is one of those ones that used
to be just the backwaters,

01:21:39.620 --> 01:21:41.430
or one of those were
people would say,

01:21:41.430 --> 01:21:43.650
there's no way this
could ever be studied.

01:21:43.650 --> 01:21:45.660
And people finally
got some headway

01:21:45.660 --> 01:21:48.490
in figuring how to look at
this stuff, which is finally

01:21:48.490 --> 01:21:50.920
all sorts of
interesting things--

01:21:50.920 --> 01:21:55.460
not just studying the ethology
releasing stimuli, neurobiology

01:21:55.460 --> 01:21:59.440
adaptive advantage of
behaviors, but understanding

01:21:59.440 --> 01:22:04.020
what the internal cognitive and
emotional life is of an animal.

01:22:04.020 --> 01:22:06.280
And you can see, it's
right at this point

01:22:06.280 --> 01:22:08.470
that old classical
behaviorists would just

01:22:08.470 --> 01:22:11.590
have to leave the room they
were so repulsed by this.

01:22:11.590 --> 01:22:14.430
Because this was just
like William James

01:22:14.430 --> 01:22:16.020
navel contemplation.

01:22:16.020 --> 01:22:19.090
What do you mean what's going on
inside the head of the animal?

01:22:19.090 --> 01:22:20.340
You measure what it's doing.

01:22:20.340 --> 01:22:23.030
It produces a behavior, and
that's how you study it.

01:22:23.030 --> 01:22:25.910
And what instead has come
out is another new branch

01:22:25.910 --> 01:22:30.490
of ethology known as
cognitive ethology.

01:22:30.490 --> 01:22:32.800
What's going on there?

01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:35.040
One of these sort of
landmark ones of it--

01:22:35.040 --> 01:22:37.320
of sort of a piece of
it-- came from a guy

01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:40.410
named Donald Griffin, who
passed away a few years ago.

01:22:40.410 --> 01:22:41.600
He was in his 90s.

01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:46.700
He was one of the towering
figures of animal behavior,

01:22:46.700 --> 01:22:48.160
whatever, over the centuries.

01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:54.020
What Donald Griffin
discovered was echolocation--

01:22:54.020 --> 01:22:55.870
that bats echolocate.

01:22:55.870 --> 01:23:00.760
Classic, classic ethologist
flavored thing of, whoa!

01:23:00.760 --> 01:23:03.600
How about we interview the
bat in sound frequencies

01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:06.670
that we humans don't consider
to be sensory stimuli?

01:23:06.670 --> 01:23:08.710
And opening up this
whole new world.

01:23:08.710 --> 01:23:10.890
He was central,
played a key role

01:23:10.890 --> 01:23:14.020
in World War II in the
development of sonar,

01:23:14.020 --> 01:23:16.070
working off of some of
the same principles.

01:23:16.070 --> 01:23:19.000
But he's the person who
discovered echolocation.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.910
Just to make all of you who
are seniors feel really upset,

01:23:21.910 --> 01:23:24.710
this was his senior
honors thesis at Harvard.

01:23:24.710 --> 01:23:25.210
And, oh!

01:23:25.210 --> 01:23:27.270
Discovered echolocation.

01:23:27.270 --> 01:23:29.590
So he passed.

01:23:29.590 --> 01:23:32.750
And he spent his
entire career on this

01:23:32.750 --> 01:23:35.250
and doing amazingly
elegant stuff.

01:23:35.250 --> 01:23:37.810
And people came
to kiss his feet.

01:23:37.810 --> 01:23:40.770
He was such an amazing
experimentalist.

01:23:40.770 --> 01:23:42.820
And when he was
about 70 years old,

01:23:42.820 --> 01:23:44.810
clearly what
occurred to him was,

01:23:44.810 --> 01:23:48.040
I don't really care what anybody
else thinks at this point.

01:23:48.040 --> 01:23:49.990
I've got something that
I want to bring up,

01:23:49.990 --> 01:23:52.860
which is the possibility
that animals actually

01:23:52.860 --> 01:23:55.320
have awareness.

01:23:55.320 --> 01:23:58.130
And he published a book
called On the Question

01:23:58.130 --> 01:23:59.920
of Animal Awareness.

01:23:59.920 --> 01:24:03.800
And it's clear he published
it then because he had tenure.

01:24:03.800 --> 01:24:06.300
And he already had tenure
in his nursing home,

01:24:06.300 --> 01:24:08.750
and he wasn't going to get
booted out by everyone saying,

01:24:08.750 --> 01:24:11.900
oh my god, did you see what
happened to Donald Griffin?

01:24:11.900 --> 01:24:14.240
He used to be a real scientist.

01:24:14.240 --> 01:24:15.910
What happened to the guy?

01:24:15.910 --> 01:24:18.820
Here he is, sitting
around speculating on,

01:24:18.820 --> 01:24:22.660
do animals have internal
lives of awareness?

01:24:22.660 --> 01:24:26.630
And what he did was outline how
what a research program to get

01:24:26.630 --> 01:24:27.680
at that would be like.

01:24:27.680 --> 01:24:29.970
And people have been
studying it ever

01:24:29.970 --> 01:24:34.300
since and showing that animals
have strategic awareness.

01:24:34.300 --> 01:24:36.470
They are doing all
sorts of subtle really.

01:24:36.470 --> 01:24:37.940
Really interesting field.

01:24:37.940 --> 01:24:39.890
So starting it off with that.

01:24:39.890 --> 01:24:42.580
Closely related to
that was the issue

01:24:42.580 --> 01:24:45.630
of whether animals
have self-awareness.

01:24:45.630 --> 01:24:47.750
And we know that dogs
don't, because they

01:24:47.750 --> 01:24:50.590
will bark at themselves in the
mirror for the rest of time.

01:24:50.590 --> 01:24:52.490
But do animals have
self-awareness?

01:24:52.490 --> 01:24:56.010
This was something pioneered
by a guy named Gordon Gallup.

01:24:56.010 --> 01:24:59.600
And like one of those
brilliant, elegant studies.

01:24:59.600 --> 01:25:00.970
Here's what he did.

01:25:00.970 --> 01:25:03.920
He would take a chimp,
a captive chimp,

01:25:03.920 --> 01:25:06.640
and he would give it
a mild anesthetic,

01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:09.570
so the chip would be a little
bit drowsy for a minute or two.

01:25:09.570 --> 01:25:11.620
And while it was
down, he would quickly

01:25:11.620 --> 01:25:13.780
run in with a magic
marker and put

01:25:13.780 --> 01:25:17.240
a little circle like on
the forehead of the chimp.

01:25:17.240 --> 01:25:19.470
Chimp comes to, goes
back to its business,

01:25:19.470 --> 01:25:22.050
where there is now a
mirror in the room.

01:25:22.050 --> 01:25:24.020
And at some point, the
chimp comes up to it,

01:25:24.020 --> 01:25:26.670
because they'll wander
around and encounter this.

01:25:26.670 --> 01:25:29.520
And here's the critical
question right now.

01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:34.590
Can the chimp figure out that's
not another chimp, that's me?

01:25:34.590 --> 01:25:36.460
And what the evidence
was that he produced

01:25:36.460 --> 01:25:39.990
to suggest this was precisely
the case was showing

01:25:39.990 --> 01:25:43.197
the chimps were now far more
likely than at the chance

01:25:43.197 --> 01:25:44.780
level-- you see how
it's being set up,

01:25:44.780 --> 01:25:46.446
this is a well-designed
experiment-- far

01:25:46.446 --> 01:25:48.730
more likely to
look in the mirror

01:25:48.730 --> 01:25:51.780
and scratch here to
see what is this thing?

01:25:51.780 --> 01:25:53.860
Where did this thing come from?

01:25:53.860 --> 01:25:56.770
And that has been viewed
as the gold standard

01:25:56.770 --> 01:25:58.550
for self-awareness.

01:25:58.550 --> 01:26:01.330
Do you look at that
and respond as if you

01:26:01.330 --> 01:26:04.350
were knowing that that
is you rather than,

01:26:04.350 --> 01:26:05.710
that's some other animal?

01:26:05.710 --> 01:26:07.660
And self-awareness
by this test has been

01:26:07.660 --> 01:26:09.450
shown in all sorts of species.

01:26:09.450 --> 01:26:11.870
Elephants by this rule
have self-awareness.

01:26:11.870 --> 01:26:13.950
I don't know who puts
the magic marker thing up

01:26:13.950 --> 01:26:15.100
on their forehead.

01:26:15.100 --> 01:26:17.520
But when you do that, they
will bring the trunk up

01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:18.600
and investigate it.

01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:21.680
But interestingly,
marmoset monkeys--

01:26:21.680 --> 01:26:25.430
those delightful, pair bonding
for life South American

01:26:25.430 --> 01:26:28.800
monkeys-- marmoset monkeys
don't have self-awareness.

01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:30.820
And that's kind of
puzzling, because all sorts

01:26:30.820 --> 01:26:33.150
of other primates
that in the rough way

01:26:33.150 --> 01:26:35.790
are as neurobiologically
complex had it.

01:26:35.790 --> 01:26:36.880
And they don't.

01:26:36.880 --> 01:26:39.600
And, OK, so Marmoset
monkeys don't.

01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:43.520
But then an ethologist, a guy
named Marc Hauser at Harvard,

01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:46.200
thought in the
monkey's own language.

01:26:46.200 --> 01:26:49.960
And knowing marmosets-- he was
a marmoset researcher-- in order

01:26:49.960 --> 01:26:53.670
to spot this on your forehead,
if you were a monkey,

01:26:53.670 --> 01:26:55.920
you have to be looking
in the mirror something

01:26:55.920 --> 01:26:59.370
very close to looking in
your reflection's eyes.

01:26:59.370 --> 01:27:03.140
And marmosets don't do that as
part of their social system.

01:27:03.140 --> 01:27:05.140
They never noticed
there was this up there,

01:27:05.140 --> 01:27:08.280
because they never look up at
that part of their reflection.

01:27:08.280 --> 01:27:11.550
So what he would do is, he
would now do the same paradigm

01:27:11.550 --> 01:27:13.260
and put the little dot here.

01:27:13.260 --> 01:27:15.640
And marmosets, off
they are a minute later

01:27:15.640 --> 01:27:18.200
trying to figure out what
this thing was about.

01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:21.830
Interviewing the animal
in its own language.

01:27:21.830 --> 01:27:22.820
What else?

01:27:22.820 --> 01:27:24.360
Another domain of this.

01:27:24.360 --> 01:27:27.050
So awareness, self awareness.

01:27:27.050 --> 01:27:31.330
Another thing now shown in other
species called theory of mind.

01:27:31.330 --> 01:27:34.440
One that psychologists,
developmental psychologists

01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:35.150
love.

01:27:35.150 --> 01:27:36.600
Theory of mind.

01:27:36.600 --> 01:27:38.510
At what point when
you were growing up

01:27:38.510 --> 01:27:41.780
do you suddenly
realize, number one,

01:27:41.780 --> 01:27:43.490
there are other individuals?

01:27:43.490 --> 01:27:45.740
There are boundaries
to individuals.

01:27:45.740 --> 01:27:48.750
You are not one sort
of ego boundaryless

01:27:48.750 --> 01:27:50.800
sort of continuation of mom.

01:27:50.800 --> 01:27:52.510
There's other
individuals who could

01:27:52.510 --> 01:27:56.960
have different information
about the world than you do.

01:27:56.960 --> 01:28:00.290
And that usually comes
around age 4 or 5 or so.

01:28:00.290 --> 01:28:03.450
My children got theory of
mind when they were 3 and 1/2.

01:28:03.450 --> 01:28:05.410
And we can document
that if need be,

01:28:05.410 --> 01:28:07.780
but it comes out
somewhere around then.

01:28:07.780 --> 01:28:10.730
And what you see-- it's a
classic test that it's done.

01:28:10.730 --> 01:28:15.176
You tell the child a story,
OK, here's the-- some of you

01:28:15.176 --> 01:28:15.800
will know this.

01:28:15.800 --> 01:28:18.180
The Mary Ann, the Barbie Ann?

01:28:18.180 --> 01:28:19.400
The Sally Anne.

01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:20.060
OK.

01:28:20.060 --> 01:28:23.060
The Sally Anne test
of theory of mind.

01:28:23.060 --> 01:28:25.720
So you tell this kid
this story about,

01:28:25.720 --> 01:28:31.380
here's this kid who has
their doll named Sally Anne.

01:28:31.380 --> 01:28:32.810
Sally?

01:28:32.810 --> 01:28:33.750
OK, Sally.

01:28:39.300 --> 01:28:39.950
OK.

01:28:39.950 --> 01:28:44.072
So they have this
doll named Sally Anne.

01:28:44.072 --> 01:28:46.530
And you tell them-- they're
totally attached to Sally Anne.

01:28:46.530 --> 01:28:48.030
They go to sleep
with it, and always

01:28:48.030 --> 01:28:49.560
on the bed, and all of that.

01:28:49.560 --> 01:28:53.960
And the kid goes off every
day to preschool or whatever.

01:28:53.960 --> 01:28:56.960
And this is the day that mom
looks at Sally Anne there

01:28:56.960 --> 01:28:59.340
and says, oh no, Sally
Anne is all soiled,

01:28:59.340 --> 01:29:01.760
and it's time to throw Sally
Anne in the washing machine.

01:29:01.760 --> 01:29:03.780
So in goes Sally Anne.

01:29:03.780 --> 01:29:05.280
And Sally Anne is
then on the dryer,

01:29:05.280 --> 01:29:06.905
eventually sitting
on top of the dryer,

01:29:06.905 --> 01:29:09.840
when child comes
back from school.

01:29:09.840 --> 01:29:12.690
And now you say to the
kid you're testing, oh,

01:29:12.690 --> 01:29:17.500
where's that child going to
go and look for Sally Anne?

01:29:17.500 --> 01:29:20.220
If you have theory
of mind, you will

01:29:20.220 --> 01:29:23.170
know the kid doesn't know
that Sally Anne wound up

01:29:23.170 --> 01:29:26.050
in the washing machine, because
she was off at preschool.

01:29:26.050 --> 01:29:30.550
And you would then say,
oh, still in the bedroom.

01:29:30.550 --> 01:29:33.130
On the other hand, if you
don't have theory of mind,

01:29:33.130 --> 01:29:36.730
it's inconceivable to you
that the child in the story

01:29:36.730 --> 01:29:38.660
wouldn't know, because you know.

01:29:38.660 --> 01:29:41.307
And they must know the
same thing, because we all

01:29:41.307 --> 01:29:42.140
know the same thing.

01:29:42.140 --> 01:29:43.848
And you would say,
the child will go look

01:29:43.848 --> 01:29:45.040
on the washing machine.

01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:48.170
That's how you begin to see
the evidence of beginning

01:29:48.170 --> 01:29:50.960
to understand that
another individual has

01:29:50.960 --> 01:29:53.230
different information
than you have.

01:29:53.230 --> 01:29:57.200
And people were soon
showing this with chimps.

01:29:57.200 --> 01:29:58.310
Here would be one example.

01:30:03.750 --> 01:30:04.640
That's not a smile.

01:30:04.640 --> 01:30:05.610
That's a banana.

01:30:05.610 --> 01:30:08.730
So you would have one chimp
here and one chimp here.

01:30:08.730 --> 01:30:12.290
And here's how you would do
this paradigm, which is this

01:30:12.290 --> 01:30:14.390
would be a high ranking chimp.

01:30:14.390 --> 01:30:17.370
This would be a low ranking one.

01:30:17.370 --> 01:30:20.290
Put him in there,
and they're watching.

01:30:20.290 --> 01:30:24.280
And an experimenter
comes along and puts down

01:30:24.280 --> 01:30:28.910
a really cool piece
of food and in a way

01:30:28.910 --> 01:30:31.479
that the chimps can't
necessarily see.

01:30:31.479 --> 01:30:33.020
But the main thing
here is that there

01:30:33.020 --> 01:30:36.750
are these dividers in between.

01:30:36.750 --> 01:30:41.350
In one case the divider,
near the dominant individual,

01:30:41.350 --> 01:30:44.130
is glass.

01:30:44.130 --> 01:30:45.530
They can see through it.

01:30:45.530 --> 01:30:47.950
In the other case, it's opaque.

01:30:47.950 --> 01:30:49.670
They can't see through it.

01:30:49.670 --> 01:30:53.160
So now, you release the
chimps to go for the food.

01:30:53.160 --> 01:30:55.780
And what happens is
the low ranking guy--

01:30:55.780 --> 01:30:59.480
if and only if this
was glass here--

01:30:59.480 --> 01:31:01.810
doesn't bother trying
to get the banana.

01:31:01.810 --> 01:31:06.150
Because he knows the
other guy saw the banana.

01:31:06.150 --> 01:31:10.370
Put up an opaque one, and
now he will go for it.

01:31:10.370 --> 01:31:11.610
Design is all wrong here.

01:31:11.610 --> 01:31:14.310
There's no divider here.

01:31:14.310 --> 01:31:16.000
So release this guy.

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.220
And if this was
opaque, he will now

01:31:18.220 --> 01:31:20.580
go for it, because he
knows the other guy doesn't

01:31:20.580 --> 01:31:22.050
know there's a banana there.

01:31:22.050 --> 01:31:25.020
He knows that the other guy
has different information

01:31:25.020 --> 01:31:25.920
than he does.

01:31:25.920 --> 01:31:29.080
Parts of the controls you
would expect to see now

01:31:29.080 --> 01:31:33.320
have this with the glass here,
where the dominant individual

01:31:33.320 --> 01:31:36.300
sees somebody bring in the
banana, shows it to them,

01:31:36.300 --> 01:31:38.430
put it down behind
the opaque screen.

01:31:38.430 --> 01:31:40.920
And take out this
dominant guy, and put

01:31:40.920 --> 01:31:43.940
in a different dominant
guy, let them loose,

01:31:43.940 --> 01:31:46.190
and he will go for the banana.

01:31:46.190 --> 01:31:48.750
Because he knows, oh,
it's not simply the rule

01:31:48.750 --> 01:31:51.710
that dominant guys who scare
me know there's a banana there.

01:31:51.710 --> 01:31:54.070
They know, he's the one
who saw there's the banana.

01:31:54.070 --> 01:31:56.740
This guy doesn't know
there's a banana there.

01:31:56.740 --> 01:31:58.220
Theory of mind.

01:31:58.220 --> 01:32:01.750
Or now do it with a
lower ranking individual,

01:32:01.750 --> 01:32:03.690
and it doesn't matter
to you whether or not

01:32:03.690 --> 01:32:05.410
they could look through
the glass or not.

01:32:05.410 --> 01:32:06.520
You're going to
go for the banana,

01:32:06.520 --> 01:32:08.270
because you're going
to get it regardless.

01:32:08.270 --> 01:32:10.390
The first bits of
evidence of theory

01:32:10.390 --> 01:32:16.160
of mind that a chimp understands
that other chimps have

01:32:16.160 --> 01:32:18.340
different information than them.

01:32:18.340 --> 01:32:20.800
What the studies
since then have shown

01:32:20.800 --> 01:32:24.220
is that chimps do not know
how to do theory of mind

01:32:24.220 --> 01:32:26.060
in a cooperative setting.

01:32:26.060 --> 01:32:28.816
They can only do
it for competition.

01:32:28.816 --> 01:32:30.190
They can only do
it when they are

01:32:30.190 --> 01:32:32.600
highly motivated in that way.

01:32:32.600 --> 01:32:34.590
But still, this is an ape.

01:32:34.590 --> 01:32:36.960
This is really quite impressive.

01:32:36.960 --> 01:32:39.520
Birds can do theory of mind.

01:32:39.520 --> 01:32:42.630
Apparently, the smartest
birds in the entire universe

01:32:42.630 --> 01:32:47.550
are corvids, which are ravens
and crows who are wildly smart.

01:32:47.550 --> 01:32:49.740
And all sorts of
interesting ethology studies

01:32:49.740 --> 01:32:53.360
that have been done on them,
including doing theory of mind.

01:32:53.360 --> 01:32:57.110
You show, with these
guys, you give them nuts

01:32:57.110 --> 01:32:59.810
or whatever it is,
seeds or whatever, which

01:32:59.810 --> 01:33:01.540
they will hide in places.

01:33:01.540 --> 01:33:05.290
And if there is another
one around looking at them,

01:33:05.290 --> 01:33:06.500
they won't hide it.

01:33:06.500 --> 01:33:07.810
Or they'll put it there.

01:33:07.810 --> 01:33:11.120
They'll dig it down into the
sawdust there or whatever.

01:33:11.120 --> 01:33:12.890
And when the other
guy isn't looking,

01:33:12.890 --> 01:33:15.580
they'll quick get it and
move it to someplace else.

01:33:15.580 --> 01:33:19.080
Because they will know,
when it's over here,

01:33:19.080 --> 01:33:21.430
that this guy doesn't
have the information.

01:33:21.430 --> 01:33:25.610
They can do theory of
mind when stashing food.

01:33:25.610 --> 01:33:27.980
More things that
animals can do that fall

01:33:27.980 --> 01:33:31.930
within the realm of this
cognitive ethology stuff, which

01:33:31.930 --> 01:33:34.380
is animals can
distinguish between

01:33:34.380 --> 01:33:38.190
intentional and
unintentional behaviors.

01:33:38.190 --> 01:33:39.880
How has this been
done in studies?

01:33:39.880 --> 01:33:42.910
One example, you take a
chimp, a captive chimp.

01:33:42.910 --> 01:33:47.590
And it has some totally great
food item sitting out there

01:33:47.590 --> 01:33:49.750
that it's about
to get access to.

01:33:49.750 --> 01:33:53.640
And along comes some lummox
of a human walking through.

01:33:53.640 --> 01:33:56.730
And in one case,
the human leans down

01:33:56.730 --> 01:34:00.680
and takes the plate of food
and flings it someplace else.

01:34:00.680 --> 01:34:02.480
And in the other
circumstance, the human

01:34:02.480 --> 01:34:05.240
comes along and accidentally
trips over the plate,

01:34:05.240 --> 01:34:06.890
flinging it someplace else.

01:34:06.890 --> 01:34:10.600
When the human leans
down and flung it away,

01:34:10.600 --> 01:34:13.930
the chimp will bang on
the walls a lot longer

01:34:13.930 --> 01:34:16.970
than when the person
accidentally tripped over it.

01:34:16.970 --> 01:34:20.510
Chimps can distinguish between
intentional and unintentional

01:34:20.510 --> 01:34:22.120
gestures like that.

01:34:22.120 --> 01:34:24.340
And dogs know the difference.

01:34:24.340 --> 01:34:26.160
Dogs absolutely
know the difference

01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:27.750
between somebody
who has kicked them

01:34:27.750 --> 01:34:30.440
and somebody who has
tripped over them.

01:34:30.440 --> 01:34:33.020
All sorts of stuff
like that, as well.

01:34:33.020 --> 01:34:34.050
What else?

01:34:34.050 --> 01:34:37.980
Evidence of animals being
able to plan for the future.

01:34:37.980 --> 01:34:40.400
And one great
example of this has

01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:42.600
been with those corvid birds.

01:34:42.600 --> 01:34:46.690
And here you have a
design where every day,

01:34:46.690 --> 01:34:50.240
there's two compartments
that the bird can go into.

01:34:50.240 --> 01:34:52.032
And on one day,
you put food here.

01:34:52.032 --> 01:34:53.990
And the next day there,
and the next day there.

01:34:53.990 --> 01:34:55.740
You alternate back and forth.

01:34:55.740 --> 01:34:58.880
The key thing is, any
time you put food in here,

01:34:58.880 --> 01:35:01.857
you put a huge amount in here.

01:35:01.857 --> 01:35:03.690
And at the end of the
day, you clear it out.

01:35:03.690 --> 01:35:05.398
Whereas when you're
putting in food here,

01:35:05.398 --> 01:35:07.470
you're putting in
only a tiny amount.

01:35:07.470 --> 01:35:10.140
So on alternating days,
they get a lot here.

01:35:10.140 --> 01:35:11.470
The next day, a little bit.

01:35:11.470 --> 01:35:12.600
A lot here, a little.

01:35:12.600 --> 01:35:15.910
And what you show, what you see
after not that long of a time,

01:35:15.910 --> 01:35:19.110
is these guys, on the day
that there's food here,

01:35:19.110 --> 01:35:23.870
will take some of it and stash
it there for the next day.

01:35:23.870 --> 01:35:26.340
Ravens and crows will do this.

01:35:26.340 --> 01:35:29.080
This is planning for the future.

01:35:29.080 --> 01:35:31.910
They have flexible,
cognitive strategies.

01:35:31.910 --> 01:35:34.010
Here's what's been
shown in bees.

01:35:34.010 --> 01:35:34.510
OK.

01:35:34.510 --> 01:35:36.880
So you do your basic
Hugo Von Frisch deal.

01:35:36.880 --> 01:35:40.030
Which is you show a bee some
interesting food source.

01:35:40.030 --> 01:35:42.510
They go back to the hive, and
they dance and tell everybody

01:35:42.510 --> 01:35:43.300
about it.

01:35:43.300 --> 01:35:45.170
But this time,
what you do is you

01:35:45.170 --> 01:35:48.940
give the bee completely
ridiculous, implausible

01:35:48.940 --> 01:35:50.010
information.

01:35:50.010 --> 01:35:51.750
You take the bee
out to the middle

01:35:51.750 --> 01:35:55.440
of the lake in your rowboat,
and you give him the food there,

01:35:55.440 --> 01:35:56.260
the nectar.

01:35:56.260 --> 01:36:00.320
And they go flying back to the
hive, and they dance like mad,

01:36:00.320 --> 01:36:02.590
and everything we
know about ethology

01:36:02.590 --> 01:36:05.020
predicts what the bees are
supposed to do at this point.

01:36:05.020 --> 01:36:06.860
But the bees don't do that.

01:36:06.860 --> 01:36:09.970
Because, in effect, they're
sitting there saying, yeah,

01:36:09.970 --> 01:36:10.600
right.

01:36:10.600 --> 01:36:11.860
In the middle of the lake?

01:36:11.860 --> 01:36:12.800
You know what you're telling us?

01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:15.150
You're telling us there's food
over in the middle of the lake

01:36:15.150 --> 01:36:15.730
there.

01:36:15.730 --> 01:36:17.410
That doesn't make any sense.

01:36:17.410 --> 01:36:18.820
We're not going
to listen to you.

01:36:18.820 --> 01:36:21.930
They don't respond if a bee,
thanks to an experimental

01:36:21.930 --> 01:36:25.500
manipulation, is telling about
a food source in a place that

01:36:25.500 --> 01:36:27.430
cannot possibly be.

01:36:27.430 --> 01:36:30.460
Flexible cognitive strategies.

01:36:30.460 --> 01:36:34.270
Finally, some evidence
in various species,

01:36:34.270 --> 01:36:38.130
but predominately studied
in chimps, of numerosity.

01:36:38.130 --> 01:36:42.730
Numerosity, as in having
a sense of numbers

01:36:42.730 --> 01:36:45.240
having meaning in
and of themselves.

01:36:45.240 --> 01:36:48.131
This is totally cool,
this experiment.

01:36:48.131 --> 01:36:48.630
OK.

01:36:48.630 --> 01:36:55.430
What you do is you teach a
chimp a series of three objects.

01:36:55.430 --> 01:36:57.640
And you show him
the first three,

01:36:57.640 --> 01:37:00.130
and they need to
recognize that, if I've

01:37:00.130 --> 01:37:03.620
seen this one before, I press
a lever, I get a food reward.

01:37:03.620 --> 01:37:06.720
You train them at the
same time to recognize

01:37:06.720 --> 01:37:08.780
three other pictures--
another trio,

01:37:08.780 --> 01:37:10.290
another trio, another trio.

01:37:10.290 --> 01:37:12.950
So the chimp has now learned
a dozen different trios

01:37:12.950 --> 01:37:15.010
of pictures and
knows how to do that.

01:37:15.010 --> 01:37:17.730
If I have seen this trio
before, hit the lever,

01:37:17.730 --> 01:37:19.190
and I get a food reward.

01:37:19.190 --> 01:37:23.020
Now what you do is
you make a mistake.

01:37:23.020 --> 01:37:28.180
What you do is you take--
here, instead of HIJ,

01:37:28.180 --> 01:37:32.350
you take out the J, and
you substitute it with A.

01:37:32.350 --> 01:37:36.440
In this case, what you
do is you take out the I,

01:37:36.440 --> 01:37:40.380
and you substitute it with
B. What's the difference?

01:37:40.380 --> 01:37:43.230
In this first case,
what you're doing is

01:37:43.230 --> 01:37:47.480
you're removing the third
object in the sequence

01:37:47.480 --> 01:37:50.540
and replacing it with
something from the first object

01:37:50.540 --> 01:37:52.170
in a different sequence.

01:37:52.170 --> 01:37:55.260
In this case, you're
replacing a second object

01:37:55.260 --> 01:37:58.920
in the sequence with another
second object in the sequence.

01:37:58.920 --> 01:38:02.800
And when you do this
quickly, tasks quickly,

01:38:02.800 --> 01:38:06.650
chimps make more mistakes
with this than with this.

01:38:06.650 --> 01:38:08.424
What's going on in their heads?

01:38:08.424 --> 01:38:10.340
They're saying, oh yeah,
this one looks right.

01:38:10.340 --> 01:38:12.260
No, wait, that one's not right.

01:38:12.260 --> 01:38:16.460
It's a different number two
than the one for this trio.

01:38:16.460 --> 01:38:20.150
When it matches the
number in the sequence,

01:38:20.150 --> 01:38:23.020
they make more mistakes,
because they have partially

01:38:23.020 --> 01:38:23.990
filed it away.

01:38:23.990 --> 01:38:27.250
Not only have I seen this
picture before-- not only

01:38:27.250 --> 01:38:30.560
have I seen this picture
before as part of this trio,

01:38:30.560 --> 01:38:34.350
but when I see it as the trio,
it's the third one that I see.

01:38:34.350 --> 01:38:36.890
It's the first one
they have had some sort

01:38:36.890 --> 01:38:40.540
of numerosity information
coming in there.

01:38:40.540 --> 01:38:43.560
Another study showing this,
and this one with chimps.

01:38:43.560 --> 01:38:46.000
And in this one, what
you do is a strategy

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.790
you've heard already,
which is you record

01:38:48.790 --> 01:38:50.240
the vocalizations of chimps.

01:38:50.240 --> 01:38:54.810
And what you do is you record
the sounds of big male chimps

01:38:54.810 --> 01:38:56.860
giving threatening bellows.

01:38:56.860 --> 01:39:00.430
So now, you hide the
speaker in some bush there,

01:39:00.430 --> 01:39:02.210
and you've got
your chimps nearby.

01:39:02.210 --> 01:39:05.850
And you play the sound of
some big male bellowing,

01:39:05.850 --> 01:39:07.800
and it's a chimp they've
never heard before.

01:39:07.800 --> 01:39:10.940
Chimps recognize individual
voices, no big surprise.

01:39:10.940 --> 01:39:12.810
And what happens is
all the males run over

01:39:12.810 --> 01:39:14.930
to the bush to investigate.

01:39:14.930 --> 01:39:17.520
Now make it a little scarier.

01:39:17.520 --> 01:39:21.370
Play the sound of two
strange male chimps

01:39:21.370 --> 01:39:24.300
bellowing, giving their
territorial calls.

01:39:24.300 --> 01:39:25.820
And do you run over or not?

01:39:25.820 --> 01:39:27.580
You have a whole bunch
of males run over.

01:39:27.580 --> 01:39:29.060
Now make it even scarier.

01:39:29.060 --> 01:39:30.750
Three voices of them.

01:39:30.750 --> 01:39:34.590
And what you see is, by the time
it gets up to there, if there

01:39:34.590 --> 01:39:38.560
are more voices of novel
males that they're hearing,

01:39:38.560 --> 01:39:40.770
than the number of
males in their group,

01:39:40.770 --> 01:39:41.980
they get out of there.

01:39:41.980 --> 01:39:44.500
And what you'll see is, they're
playing the voice there.

01:39:44.500 --> 01:39:46.940
They begin, and they add in
another one sequentially.

01:39:46.940 --> 01:39:49.320
And say this will come
up to four voices,

01:39:49.320 --> 01:39:51.600
and they'll show the three
chimps are like coming

01:39:51.600 --> 01:39:53.140
up there ready to investigate.

01:39:53.140 --> 01:39:56.520
And three voices, and
uh-oh, we're out numbered.

01:39:56.520 --> 01:39:57.130
Numbered.

01:39:57.130 --> 01:39:58.230
We're out numbered.

01:39:58.230 --> 01:40:01.200
And they slither back and go
the other way at that point.

01:40:01.200 --> 01:40:04.560
They have a sense of
the number four is

01:40:04.560 --> 01:40:06.550
bigger than the number three.

01:40:06.550 --> 01:40:09.350
Finally, evidence of
transitive thinking.

01:40:09.350 --> 01:40:11.820
Not just in nonhuman
primates, but as

01:40:11.820 --> 01:40:16.500
shown here by Russ Fernals in
the bio department in fish.

01:40:16.500 --> 01:40:20.210
I'm watching a defeat b.

01:40:20.210 --> 01:40:22.770
Then b defeats me.

01:40:22.770 --> 01:40:25.750
I go and give a
subordinate gesture to a.

01:40:25.750 --> 01:40:27.190
And this has now been shown.

01:40:27.190 --> 01:40:29.740
And a similar theme
again, it's only

01:40:29.740 --> 01:40:32.600
done in the context
of competition,

01:40:32.600 --> 01:40:34.580
highly motivated circumstances.

01:40:34.580 --> 01:40:35.080
OK.

01:40:35.080 --> 01:40:36.260
So what do we got now?

01:40:36.260 --> 01:40:39.440
We've got a completely different
way of thinking about behavior

01:40:39.440 --> 01:40:44.210
and emphasizing here natural
setting-- experimentation

01:40:44.210 --> 01:40:46.980
rather than coming up with
those just so stories.

01:40:46.980 --> 01:40:49.180
The notions of all
sorts of species,

01:40:49.180 --> 01:40:52.650
including us, functioning
in sensory domains that

01:40:52.650 --> 01:40:54.030
are unheard of.

01:40:54.030 --> 01:40:57.090
And finally, all sorts
of types of learning that

01:40:57.090 --> 01:40:59.180
are ways in which
organisms are not supposed

01:40:59.180 --> 01:41:01.910
to learn that all of us do.
